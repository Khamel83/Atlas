# Atlas: Cognitive Amplification Platform

**Documentation up-to-date as of July 2025**

## üöÄ System Overview

- **Unified Job Scheduling:** All automated jobs (ingestion, maintenance, model discovery) are managed by APScheduler and a web UI (FastAPI + Jinja2). Jobs are persistent, visible, and fully manageable in the web interface, with real log viewing and last run status.
- **Enhanced Model Selection:** The model selector always tries free models first, with tiered fallback to paid options. Usage is tracked for cost optimization. Model discovery is automated and configuration is via `.env`. See `docs/ENHANCED_MODEL_SELECTOR_GUIDE.md`.
- **Bulletproof Capture & Processing:** All content is captured in a never-fail stage, then processed in a robust queue with retries and comprehensive logging. See `docs/CAPTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.

For full details, see the authoritative documentation in `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ENHANCED_MODEL_SELECTOR_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.

## üß† Cognitive Amplification Features

Atlas now includes a full suite of cognitive amplification tools, accessible via both API and a web dashboard:

- **Proactive Surfacer**: Surfaces forgotten/stale content for review or re-engagement.
- **Temporal Engine**: Finds time-aware relationships between content items.
- **Socratic Question Generator**: Generates Socratic questions from your content.
- **Active Recall Engine**: Schedules spaced repetition for knowledge retention.
- **Pattern Detector**: Detects common tags and sources, surfacing patterns and insights.

### API Endpoints
- `/ask/proactive` (GET): Surfaces forgotten content (JSON)
- `/ask/temporal` (GET): Time-aware relationships (JSON)
- `/ask/socratic` (POST): Socratic questions (JSON)
- `/ask/recall` (GET): Spaced repetition review (JSON)
- `/ask/patterns` (GET): Top tags and sources (JSON)

### Dashboard UI
- `/ask/html`: Interactive dashboard for all cognitive features

### Quickstart
1. **Start the web server:**
```bash
   uvicorn web.app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
2. **Visit the dashboard:**
   [http://localhost:8000/ask/html](http://localhost:8000/ask/html)
3. **Explore features:**

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Security Issues Detected"**
- Type `y` to continue past .env file permissions warning

**"OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set"**
- Normal warning - AI features disabled but basic ingestion works

**URLs returning 404**
- Check that URLs in input files are valid and accessible

**"No such file or directory"**
- Ensure you're in the Atlas directory and have created .env file

### Getting Help

1. Check [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for setup issues
2. Review [docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md](docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md) for known limitations
3. Check logs in `output/logs/` for detailed error information
4. Review the retry queue in `retries/` for failed items

## üéØ Project Status

**Current State**: Atlas is a functional content ingestion system with sophisticated article fetching, YouTube transcript extraction, and podcast processing. The core pipeline works well but requires manual configuration and has some rough edges.

**What Works**: Multi-source content ingestion, robust error handling, comprehensive logging, retry mechanisms, and structured output.

**What Doesn't**: AI features require API keys, no web interface, manual input file management, and some advanced features are still in development.

**Bottom Line**: Atlas is a working system that needs better onboarding and documentation, not major architectural changes.

## üîÅ GitHub Sync Hook Setup

Atlas enforces GitHub consistency with a `post-commit` Git hook:

After every commit:
- üîÑ It **automatically pushes** your changes to GitHub
- üîç It **verifies the commit is live** on GitHub by commit hash
- ‚ùå It **fails loudly** if not successfully pushed

### ‚úÖ How to enable it

In your local repo, run:

```bash
cp scripts/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
