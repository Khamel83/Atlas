The most fun ones change my mind. By that measure, this Deep Dive on Rox was incredibly fun: I think AI applications might actually be able to dig moats, as just one example. </p><p>I hope you learn as much reading it as I did writing it, and that it gives you plenty to chew on while you’re not chewing on turkey. </p><p>Let’s get to it. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6074a16d-3d88-433f-bf8c-473ca1996202?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff175bb73-f590-46e3-8483-29ba2579671f_1200x600.png\"></a></figure></div><p>To start, I need to clear the air: </p><p>I did not expect to be writing a Deep Dive on “an AI-native Salesforce.” </p><p>AI applications are fascinating and I love using them, but I’ve struggled to imagine any individual AI application surviving seven to ten years to IPO when AI moves so fast. </p><p>CRMs are not fascinating and I hate using them.

What one-year-old company could possibly warrant $50 million? Before meeting Ishan, that’s what I would have done! </p><p>Another might be to try to understand what these intelligent people see about the future that we can learn from. Now that I’ve met Ishan, that’s what we’re going to do. </p><p>I now believe dozens of companies being built today will be responsible for the workload that millions of employees across tens of thousands of companies currently handle. </p><p>More importantly, Rox showed me how they’ll do it. </p><p>So this is a Deep Dive on what that future might look like and how we’re going to get there.</p><p>As we go through, there are three themes I want you to keep in mind: </p><ol><li><p><strong>AI Application Strategy:</strong><span> Before this piece, I was unsure how AI applications could dig moats. Rox is using AI’s current capabilities to attract data and integrations so that it can deliver more powerful agents as underlying models improve. It’s a long game. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of the Best: </strong><span>AI won’t replace all humans, but it won’t be equally good for everyone. Rox’s vision is one in which a small number of the most talented, highest-agency people do 100x more with the support of increasingly capable agents.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Timing Matters: </strong><span>There is an opportunity to replace entrenched systems of record right now, and winning means playing that timing exactly right to create path dependence.</span></p></li></ol><p>So why now? </p><h3><strong>Why Now?</strong></h3><p>Here’s something that I didn’t realize, because I didn’t care to, but is actually interesting: </p><p><strong>Salesforce, the 800 lb. system of record for revenue teams, is losing its place as the system of record.</strong></p><p>That’s not to say that people aren’t using Salesforce – everyone is. There’s almost no choice but to. </p><p><span>When Ramp CTO </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7115f839-9f1d-4432-9742-fbc59761e685?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Karim Atiyeh</a><span> started the company, he swore, “We’re not going to use Salesforce. I hate Salesforce. We’re going to make our own stuff.” </span></p><p>No company is better at making their own stuff than Ramp. If anyone could break the tyranny of Salesforce, it’s Ramp. Today, Ramp uses Salesforce.</p><p>It’s just to say that Salesforce is no longer where the most valuable data lives. </p><p><span>“The underlying data that drives Salesforce left Salesforce five years back,” Ishan explained. It moved to the data warehouse, provided by companies like Snowflake. In fact, </span><strong>40% of all data in data warehouses is customer data.</strong><span>”</span></p><p>That stat knocked me out of my indifference. Even if you don’t care about the CRM, the CRM cares about you. </p><p><em>40% of all data in data warehouses is customer data. </em><span>It makes sense – business can be boiled down to two functions, building and selling, and selling increasingly involves knowing evermore about the people to whom you’re selling – but still. 40% is a lot. And it’s moving. </span></p><p>So why is all that data leaving Salesforce and heading to the data warehouse? </p><p><span>Sales has started to move from an upfront, commit-based model to </span><strong>consumption-based models</strong><span>. Think Stripe: the more payments your company runs on Stripe, the more you pay Stripe. Think Ramp: the more payments your company makes with Ramp, the more Ramp earns. Think OpenAI: the more your company pulls intelligence from their APIs, the more you pay them. </span></p><p>“Now, numbers on contracts are just words,” Ishan says, “Your salesperson has to sell value day in and day out.” That requires different data types, and different data sources. </p><p>Now, instead of just knowing whether a company is in the pipeline or closed-won, for how many seats, and when the contract is set to renew, your salesperson needs to know how much your customers are using which of your products and whether they’ve experienced issues, among other things. All of this flows into the data warehouse. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/62cfed92-6c35-49b9-b8e5-17307c4f1728?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c53df15-0934-4de2-a6f7-231745c79170_908x585.png\"></a><figcaption><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b445753f-fe99-4fe7-8aae-e5a165dd0b07?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Revenue Stack of the Past versus the Future according to Rox</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Before starting Rox, Ishan talked to more than 300 teams, and found that 90% of them had already built an internal replacement for Salesforce on top of their data warehouse with customer-level analytics to help their go-to-market teams more proactively manage their accounts. </p><p><span>“In our view,” </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/52135f9b-0be8-4fb8-94bc-12a089a90edc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">writes General Catalyst</a><span>, “the best companies have been forced to invest millions to rebuild their revenue operating systems in-house in order to remain competitive.”</span></p><p>So Ishan asked a question similar to the one a lot of founders ask right before starting their companies: “Do we feel like every team needs to rebuild their CRM  in the warehouse?” </p><p>He answered in a similar way, too: “No, we should build it for all of them.”</p><p><strong>The opportunity: build the anti-Salesforce.</strong><span> </span></p><p>While Salesforce built a closed system that companies had to adapt to, and many ultimately outgrew, Rox is building an open system that adapts to companies' existing and evolving data infrastructure.

One of the biggest advantages Salesforce has is becoming obsolete, at least as far as tech-forward companies, the type that Rox is targeting, are concerned. </p><p><span>Worse than obsolete, actually. Because Salesforce is heavily </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/62f7a3ed-6214-4bfb-af4c-b2604c1c2784?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">positioned</a><span> in the old model, it is more susceptible to counter-positioning from a company like Rox. Rox's open approach is one that Salesforce can’t embrace without hurting its existing business, but it’s one that’s compelling to modern companies already building on top of the data warehouse. The more deeply companies integrate Rox into their data infrastructure and workflows – because they trust that it is their </span><em>own</em><span> system of record, and because Rox can help train agents on their data securely - the more valuable it becomes.</span></p><p><span>Of course, Salesforce isn’t in imminent danger. The system of record is one of the most defensible positions in software; it has high “switching costs,” in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/91b1147a-f2dd-441c-840a-9fd1e99f199d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">7 Powers</a><span> </span></em><span>terms. </span></p><p>Plus, there’s just that sunk cost thing: because Salesforce is so brutal to implement, most companies that use it have spent so much time and money implementing Salesforce that they’re unlikely to rip it out. Stockholm Syndrome as a Moat or something. </p><p>But I think Salesforce is unlikely to win the next shift, which means there’s an opportunity for a company that builds software that customers actually like to take the lessons from what Salesforce does well and apply them to modern software that serves modern companies. </p><p><span>That leads to the next question: </span><strong>but aren’t there a thousand companies going after this opportunity? </strong></p><p>The internet is now littered with AI-native would-be Salesforce killers of all shapes and sizes. Companies are promising that they’ll write more effective outbound, handle all of your inbound, even replace salespeople altogether. </p><p><span>Isn’t this the problem we started with? That AI will undoubtedly handle an increasing amount of the work that sellers do today, but that with so much competition and noise, it’s practically impossible to take an informed view on </span><em>which, if any, </em><span>specific AI-native company will win and endure? </span></p><p><strong>The paradox at the heart of Rox is that AI for Revenue Teams is so obviously going to be a big category that it’s really hard to imagine who the big winners might be. </strong></p><p><span>This is the paradox at the heart of </span><em>every </em><span>applied AI company. So it’s worth diving even deeper here before we answer how Rox plans to resolve it. </span></p><h3><strong>The AI Shift, Increasing Returns, and Path Dependence</strong></h3><p>To understand how Rox might resolve this paradox, we need to understand something deeper about AI and timing.</p><p>AI is the Big Why Now, the platform shift that is launching a thousand startups. </p><p>Apart from the fact that data is moving from Salesforce to data warehouses, there is a broader once-in-a-Techno-Economic-Paradigm opportunity to build new systems of record for two reasons: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Current AI Can Make Sense of Unstructured Data.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Companies Just Want to Buy AI.  </strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Current AI Can Make Sense of Unstructured Data. </strong><span>Data was already moving from structured systems like Salesforce to unstructured data warehouses. Now, AI models can make sense of this chaos and deliver it in useful ways. </span></p><p>With the advantages of a structured database becoming less relevant, the structure is now a liability; it’s too heavy. It requires too much manual work from the user, when they could and should be doing more productive things. </p><p>Instead of taking a call and then manually entering notes into Salesforce, now you can just upload all of your emails, texts, and Gong calls and enter it into a new system. Even with current models, a well-built system can just make sense of it all. Unstructured data is what AI does best. </p><p>Still, as we discussed, convincing companies to move to a new system is hard when they’ve invested so much money, time, and effort in the old one. How do you convince them to start uploading their emails, test, and Gong calls into something new? </p><p><span>And I think the answer is as simple as: </span><strong>Companies Just Want to Buy AI.</strong></p><p>This shows up in revenue numbers, earnings transcripts, everywhere. AI is the hot new thing, and both consumers and companies are willing to spend to get it – even if they’re just spending experimental budget, at first. That experimental budget is a crack, a wedge, a small opening.</p><p>There is, right now, thanks to AI, an opportunity to sell products to companies that may otherwise have been happy sticking with their old software and building internal tooling around it. </p><p>This rush to buy AI creates a couple of challenges, though. </p><p><span>First, revenue is easy but potentially not sticky, something I wrote about as far back as May 2023 in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/79442d3b-2492-4c93-b71f-770900decd64?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Small Applications, Growing Protocols</a></em><span> and expanded on in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/dd37ebe2-1c80-4c04-8ea7-c70b3d8772af?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">When to Dig a Moat</a></em><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>This is why the VCs and commentariat are jumping up and down about the lack of moats in generative AI. </span><strong>There is practically no uncertainty</strong><span>. </span></em></p></blockquote><p>Second, while there is no uncertainty that AI is a big thing, there is a lot of uncertainty about how models will improve – that things are moving so fast – that it feels like a leap of faith to bet on any one application now. There are hundreds of Sales AIs in the market today. </p><p><span>Plus, it’s really hard to figure out </span><em>which </em><span>companies will win because the best product doesn’t always win and success is often dependent on small, random events–on luck. </span></p><p>BUT, you have to compete now, because in these moments, cracks open that don’t open often, and the companies that win – whether or not they have the best product today, whether or not they were just lucky, whether or not you build something better in the future – get locked in. </p><p><span>This dynamic - where early moves matter more than perfect execution - is exactly what economist W. Brian Arthur explored in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/402a7013-be1d-42b0-8203-111c96f47ca0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</a></em><span>.

The outcomes at any given time are strongly influenced by the historical choices or events that led there. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3a9ab1c0-a80a-4b2f-9d9a-c4431cd54af5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54d3fd1a-a53c-4b49-85c2-6c080c94f103_908x515.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>Customers are sufficiently motivated by the AI hype today that they are willing to buy new tools.

Once they make the switch and try something new, if it’s better </span><em>enough </em><span>than what they’re using now, they might not switch again. The best product might not win. The one that gets in the door, shows some value, and becomes locked-in might. </span></p><p><span>In an environment like this, early </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0d21b79e-9a76-4408-b5f3-ef836f4ec406?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">strategy</a><span> matters a lot, because decisions today will lock in winners for years to come. </span></p><p>You can’t afford to wait to build a product in a nascent market even if you think AI isn’t yet good enough to do everything that companies are promising it will. </p><p><span>So you need to play now, while the shift is happening, but the space is incredibly competitive, full of companies overpromising based on what AI </span><em>might</em><span> enable at some point in the future. </span></p><p><span>Arthur argues that luck plays a key role in determining the winner, but what struck me reading that book is that </span><strong>luck should be hackable</strong><span>. In other words, companies should be able to make their own luck and pull the world onto their path.</span></p><p>That is what Rox is doing, and it’s the best way to think about its strategy.</p><p>How do you create path dependence? </p><p>Salesforce is the definition of path dependence: it’s not the best software, but it’s locked in. </p><p>The lesson from Salesforce is that you need to get customers to add integrations and data to your system of record. </p><p>That is Rox’s goal, too. </p><p><span>Rox is a fuzzy acronym for </span><strong>Revenue Operating System</strong><span>. That is the long-term goal, to “run the world’s revenue.” The official name is Rox Data Corp. It was a data company before it was an AI company, and data remains the most important thing.</span></p><p>“For us, AI is a means to an end,” Ishan told me. “My life is about using software and technology in a pragmatic context of driving productivity gains in the economy.” </p><p><span>The company’s proximate goal is to </span><strong>build a new system of record for revenue teams</strong><span>. </span></p><p>The way the company uses AI today is an implementation detail in service of that proximate goal. How it will use AI in the future, when AI is stronger, will be a consequence of achieving that proximate goal. </p><p><strong>The game right now is being useful enough, early enough to get customers to connect their data.</strong><span> </span></p><p>This is how I’ve come to think about Rox’s strategy, and I think a version of it may be broadly applicable to all sorts of applied AI companies: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Get in the door with good enough AI.</strong><span> Rox uses today’s AI as a customer acquisition tool and as a way to be helpful enough to the best sellers at the best companies to get those companies to integrate all of the other tools and data they use to sell. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Build the System of Record</strong><span>. The data and integrations are the real prize in the medium term. Use them to help customers build a unified system of record that stays inside their own data structures and that they can manage. Become an essential workflow. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Use That Position to Securely Train Agents.</strong><span> Over the long term, managing the data and integrations - and becoming a part of companies’ workflows – gives Rox the opportunity to securely train increasingly useful agents that can do more and more of the revenue teams’ functions as AI gets better and better. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Automate Revenue Operations.</strong><span> This is the huge prize: owning the agents that work with the top 1% of salespeople and replace most of the rest. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>In other words, use pretty good AI to acquire customers and embed in their workflow so that you’re best positioned to offer them increasingly powerful agents as models improve</strong><span>. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cf5d49e4-c6f2-4796-ad32-49caf5bbc7a4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53b5fc92-b23b-45ac-840e-f895bfade02d_908x596.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Let’s break it down in more detail. Rox’s strategy starts with this premise:</p><p><strong>AI is really good today but not great, and not nearly what it will be.</strong><span> </span></p><p>That sounds like an obvious premise, but it’s not consensus.</p><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8bb14cea-f5c4-4090-bddb-75666bf0845c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">11x</a><span>, which sells “Digital Workers, Human Results for Sales, RevOps, and Go-To-Market Teams,” just announced a $50 million Series B led a16z after a $24 million Series A led by Benchmark in September. </span></p><p><span>The company’s </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/637fcacb-7179-429f-91a2-0573f2b3a0ac?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">manifesto</a><span> is the opposite of what Rox’s would be if they’d written one: </span><strong>“While others offer tools that merely assist human sales teams, 11x delivers complete revenue generation through autonomous AI workers that operate at scale.”</strong></p><p>That may be the right approach! I am not here to tell you that Rox is better than 11x or vice versa. The market will decide that. I’m here to learn, and analyze Rox’s strategy, and, to start at least, Rox’s strategy is to “merely assist human sales teams.” </p><p><strong>Rox doesn’t want to replace people; it wants to make the best better.</strong></p><p>Now that Rox has launched publicly, its website has more information than when I first encountered it. This is what it greets you with: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a1212b27-3444-46cb-999e-1ed4cf7f9049?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1678,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a5b08bf-7d35-4e50-a1df-d03016bf3dab_839x180.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>Rox is built to help the </span><strong>top sellers</strong><span> at the </span><strong>top companies</strong><span> – Ramp, OpenAI, and MongoDB are among Rox’s first customers – do more of what they do best, the human side of selling that will probably never go away, the stuff you see on Mad Men. </span></p><p>Taken ad absurdum, in the future in which Rox succeeds, you can imagine one incredibly talented seller supported by thousands of AI agents selling billions of dollars worth of business. </p><p>In this future, the pool of best sellers is shaped something like the NBA – a few hundred of the obviously best, stratified even within that, demanding eye-popping sums and earning their companies even more. </p><p>But that’s the future. We’ll get there. </p><p><span>Today, Rox offers companies </span><strong>swarms of agents</strong><span> – one agent per account, each tasked with knowing as much as possible about that single account based on internal and external information. With that information, it can alert sellers in the right way at the right time, surface opportunities, and do things like helping to draft emails. It will not, for now, do the selling. </span></p><p>The idea is to make these agents so useful so quickly that companies add more integrations and data sources to make them even more useful, which gives Rox the opportunity to cement itself in the workflow, build the system of record, and maybe, one day, topple Salesforce. </p><p>“What takes a great seller 15-25 minutes of research on Google and LinkedIn, Rox accomplishes in one second,” according to Max Freeman, the VP of Sales at Ramp. That saves time, makes his team more proactive, and helps the sellers sell. </p><p>Rox contractually obligates itself to provide value out of the gate. The company writes its contracts such that if customers don’t get a 2x ROI on Rox in the first 90 days, they can cancel. Today, customers make their money back on new opportunities created, at-risk customers saved, and growth from high-potential customers. </p><p>If Rox does what it says it does, the company is betting that people will feed it more data and integrations so that it can make them even more efficient. </p><p>But a 9-figure valuation for a one-year-old company suggests investors see something beyond mere efficiency gains. </p><p><span>I think it’s this: </span><strong>Rox is using the fact that companies are willing to buy AI as a foot in the door to prove usefulness to get more data and integrations to build the system of record and earn customer trust and usage and learn so that Rox is ready when AI gets really good.</strong></p><p><span>This isn’t just good strategy, it’s </span><em>grand</em><span> strategy. </span></p><p><span>In </span><span>John Lewis Gaddis defines the term as “the alignment of potentially unlimited aspirations with necessarily limited capabilities.”</span></p><p>Grand strategy requires an honest assessment of those limited capabilities as they are today, not as you want them to be. </p><p>“Napoleon lost his empire by confusing aspirations with capabilities; Lincoln saved his country by not doing so.” </p><p>In Rox’s case, the capabilities of AI agents as they stand today are that they:</p><ol><li><p>Can make sense of unstructured data.</p></li><li><p>Are excellent customer acquisition tools. </p></li></ol><p>Today, in other words, AI is a means, not an end. A capability, not an aspiration. </p><p><span>Rox’s approach, as Ishan described it, is to </span><strong>“build whatever you need to build to get companies to feed your system of record.” </strong></p><p>Instead of promising agents that will sell for you, they build agents that will help you sell. </p><p>Instead of helping sellers go after new customers, Rox helps them “go after the most unglamorous piece – their existing customers.” This, Ishan tells me, is who “80-90% of revenue comes from.” It’s also who companies have the most data on. And it’s the group of companies worst-served by existing systems, which are focused on contract-based versus consumption-based sales. </p><p>This approach addresses the two big concerns I’ve had about AI application companies, turns them into advantages, even. </p><p><span>“First, revenue is easy but potentially not sticky, something I wrote about as far back as May 2023 in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/79442d3b-2492-4c93-b71f-770900decd64?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Small Applications, Growing Protocols</a></em><span>.”</span></p><p>In Rox’s case, AI support agents are the small applications, and the data and workflows are the company’s own “protocol” which gets more valuable with time, integrations, and more applications from Rox itself. Like a protocol, it is open – companies will build on Rox if it’s the best place to build, and leave and take their data with them if it isn’t. </p><p>“Second, there is so much uncertainty about how models will improve – that things are moving so fast – that it feels like a leap of faith to bet on any one application now. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of GTM AIs in the market today,” including well-funded ones like 11x.</p><p><span>Proving value early and often, incrementally at first, is a way to </span><em>manufacture</em><span> increasing returns and path dependence. </span></p><p>Small early wins at high velocity compound. Overpromising and underdelivering does not. </p><p>So what does Rox promise, and do, today? </p><p>Rox’s product today is straightforward: agents assigned to each of a seller’s accounts collect and monitor internal and external data and surface the most relevant bits to the seller. </p><p>Typically, I would explain exactly what and how the product does, but I think Rox’s launch video does a really good job, so I’d encourage you to watch it. </p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/15484ed3-2d0b-40cc-8942-62aee3761b81?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/VHFt08yQfeY\"></a><p>Rox doesn’t promise the moon, but it does what it promises. Kiran Nagra, Ramp’s Sales Leader for Account Management, says in the video: “If they say, ‘Our product is going to do X,’ I open the platform and it already does X.” </p><p>Promise that agents will help do a limited number of things, and then deliver on that promise. </p><p>For now, those are straightforward but hard-to-build-well features like tracking relevant information about customers, adding it to their profile, and making suggestions to include the most relevant in an upcoming call. </p><p>That last piece – the upcoming call – requires that sellers integrate their calendars. If Rox is useful enough pre-calendar integration, if it does what it says, then sellers are more likely to add their calendars, to see what else it can do. Next, says Ishan, comes “email, Salesforce, Slack, support tickets, then the full data warehouse.” If each makes sellers more effective, and saves them time, then they’ll add the next. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9fd6ea1b-4938-4f10-8189-efe31fbe8cdf?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1358,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa40f5a59-fa23-4896-bf4d-f4743f82bb95_679x437.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Rox Integrations</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>\"The hardcore engineering,\" he said, \"lies in connecting all of that into one real-time system of record.\" You can </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/482e430f-d705-4400-8786-2198aa3d8035?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">read the Docs</a><span> if you want to learn how they do it. </span></p><p>There are other product features, too, each of which feeds Rox with data. It can record calls and add them to your account, which is table stakes – a tool that exists in many point solutions – but more valuable as part of a system of record. Using OpenAI’s voice APIs, sellers can talk directly to Rox, to ask it questions or get briefed on the day ahead. Even that, also becoming table stakes, is a way for Rox’s models to learn how sellers think in order to, eventually, build better and better sales agents. </p><p>For all of this to work, to grow to those future aspirations from current capabilities, Rox has to deliver. </p><p>Currently, that looks like saving sellers 8+ hours per week, delivering a 35% increase in customer engagement via more targeted messaging, and that 2x ROI on Rox spend that the company promises to deliver. </p><p>Max at Ramp told me that Rox’s ability to deliver what it promised stood out. “The market of GTM AI has become so saturated with nonsense, but Rox is really legit” he said. “We’ve got 66 sellers in Rox. Their feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It’s truly given us an edge in making our sellers operate more efficiently without doing more mundane tasks.” </p><p>As one example, he said that a seller on the large accounts team was preparing for an onsite with a big customer the next day. He clicked on the account in Rox and saw that KKR had just invested in the company, and that the company had hired a new CRO. Two insights: ownership transition (with a potential connection) and leadership change. Those are the types of things sellers need to know. The types of things that would have taken 15-25 minutes to learn before that take a second with Rox. “It tripped me out, honestly,” Max said. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/aee94e53-a4b6-42b0-892d-29d0146fe7e6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1658,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d903ab8-a644-43f1-828a-178db5090c3f_829x542.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Rox Account Reports </em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>A great seller would not have gone into the onsite without knowing those things. He would have figured it out on his own. But those extra 15-25 minutes </span><em>not </em><span>doing manual grunt work are 15-25 more minutes he can spend doing things that only a great seller can do, like talking to customers.</span></p><p>“Ramp is a high intensity, high volume, high velocity shop,” he said. “If you’re on eight to ten calls a day, this gives you the ability to have a point of view or hypothesis before entering every call.” </p><p>Rox chose to work with companies like Ramp – high intensity, high volume, high velocity shops – because those are the ones for whom the product is most immediately valuable. </p><p><span>As Rox says on its website and in its launch video, </span><strong>it exists to make the best better</strong><span>. That applies to both companies and sellers within those companies. </span></p><h3><strong>The Rise of the Best</strong><span> </span></h3><p>Another important piece of ensuring that your ambitions match your capabilities, and to making your own luck, is to be targeted in your use of limited resources. </p><p>Broadly speaking, Rox could have pursued three categories of customers:</p><ol><li><p>Today’s Largest Companies.</p></li><li><p>Scaling Companies. </p></li><li><p>Small Startups.  </p></li></ol><p>Today’s Largest Companies don’t make sense for some of the reasons we’ve already discussed. They’re probably not building their own products on top of the data warehouse, may not have the urgency of a smaller company, and are likely to die with their Salesforce boots on.</p><p>The third approach - Small Startups – is almost the default for startups thanks to Stripe’s success getting in with developers early and growing with them. That that approach worked for Stripe, though, was due to a much more specific reason than most people realize: SMBs were a perfect first customer because, with lower spend volumes, they weren’t as sensitive to take rates as Adyen’s larger customers, which meant Stripe has always had a higher average take rate. </p><p>In Rox’s case, small companies aren’t the right target: they probably don’t have a real sales org yet, nor do they yet have the best salespeople. </p><p>“You want to raise the ceiling of what someone incredible can do versus raise the floor on what a shitty salesperson at a small company can do,” as one person colorfully put it. </p><p>Instead of taking Stripe’s approach, Rox is targeting companies like Stripe itself: tech-forward enterprises with enough scale that Rox matters. </p><p>Smaller organizations can, in the famous words of YCombinator, “Do things that don’t scale.” Scaling companies definitionally need to do things that can. </p><p>“We have deep founder-market fit in businesses at scale,” Ishan explained, “businesses doing $100M or even $1 billion in revenue. We want to become essential, which happens at a certain number of reps and revenue.”</p><p>Ishan calls their approach selling to these companies “Palantir-style”: “We want to help business owners when they’re in extreme pain or when there’s extreme priority.” </p><p>In the beginning, like Palantir, that also means getting to work closely with the best people at the best companies to develop the product, another benefit to the focus on the best. </p><p>Kiran at Ramp said that Rox co-founder Diogo Ribeiro has been building alongside her since Ramp started using Rox. “He’s flying out to NYC for the team’s offsite next week,” she said. “He already did that once a month ago.” </p><p><span>If the long game is to collect the data – not just the moment in time data, but an ongoing understanding of the way that the best sellers think and operate – in order to train better models for revenue teams, there’s no substitute for working with the best. </span><strong>Gold in, gold out. </strong></p><p>The other half of working with the best is working with and for the best sellers inside the best companies. </p><p>Speaking with Ishan, Kiran, Max, and others around the company it was hard not to get the sense that AI tools – Rox specifically, but more generally, too – will 1000x the capabilities of the top people and replace mediocre ones. </p><p>Max put it bluntly: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>This may sound ruthless, but </span><strong>if you’re a mediocre seller or worse, your job is over</strong><span>. You’re truly done. If you’re better than mediocre, you’re becoming a lot more efficient. You can focus on selling, not doing monotonous labor.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Kiran agreed. Her SMB AE team is now responsible for both onboarding customers and managing the relationship over the long-term, a double job that she says is “now possible because of tools like Rox.” </p><p>To measure the ROI of Rox, she began piloting it with a few reps on her team, and “started to see ROI from those reps, so I piloted giving them larger books, then I piloted the new double role using Rox.” Not only did it work, “My reps were asking me, ‘How early are these guys? Can I invest?’” </p><p>If reps are more efficient with Rox – can spend more time building relationships with and educating customers – she can increase their book size, which means more money for them. Once there’s enough proof that it’s really working, “I can hire 6 fewer people than the 18 I have earmarked.” </p><p>More money for the best sellers. More profitability for Ramp. And the ineffable speed that comes from maintaining a small, high-performing team instead of hiring more and more people who each do a little bit less than the last one. </p><p><span>I think this is a preview of the world to come:</span><strong> the best will get better, the rest will need to find something that they’re better at doing. </strong></p><p>This is not a value judgment – that’s obviously disruptive to many people – but it feels clear that this is how things are going to be. </p><p>AI won’t take your job. The best people using AI will obviate the need for it. </p><h3><strong>Strategy vs. Execution</strong><span> </span></h3><p>“The best people” is a theme you hear over and over again when talking to Rox: both in terms of their customers and their employees. Small teams of talented people move fast, and speed wins.</p><p><span>The other thing I thought when I read </span><em>Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</em><span> is, “This is the technical explanation for the advice to build and iterate fast.” </span></p><p>In other words, given a shared starting point, the company that is able to try more things more quickly and get to the better solution faster should increase its chances of becoming the winner. Speed creates more surface area for luck. </p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><span> set the right strategy. </span></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> execute violently against it. </span></p><p>It’s messier than that, of course, because Step 2 informs Step 1 in a never-ending loop. But roughly, that’s the formula for success. We’ve talked a lot about Rox’s strategy so far, but what also stood out in my conversations is how this team executes. </p><p>There are the metrics: already, less than a year old, 95% of which was spent in stealth, the company has blown past the $1 million ARR mark. Its customer list is full of discerning customers including Ramp, OpenAI, MongoDB, NVIDIA, Databricks, Coreweave, Confluent, and Ishan’s old company, New Relic. </p><p>All of that came before the company launched, which it did last week via announcements, through which Rox and others did the talking, and an open beta, through which the product has been able to speak for itself.</p><p>Letting anyone sign up and test a product like Rox’s this early is, as Jonathan Haas put, “the strongest endorsement of their confidence in this product as anything,” because it means fully exposing the product to the public instead of a small group of partners, putting a ton of load on Rox’s infrastructure, and incurring big inference bills with no guarantee companies will convert. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3fb6dde7-2f6b-483b-b217-fd069fc71832?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_540,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8da68f1e-533e-4f06-ac9a-e6000df808f5_540x432.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>Since launching, </span><strong>Rox has onboarded over 1,000 companies into their public beta</strong><span>.</span></p><p>But the metrics never do justice to the je ne sais quoi that you get from a company that just ships really fast against a really high quality bar. Rox has the je ne sais quoi. </p><p>Every time I interview people for a deep dive, I ask, “If you read this piece and it’s missing X, you’ll be like ‘Man, he missed the point.’ What’s X?” </p><p>Kiran said that two things stick out with Rox: Empathy - deeply understanding customer needs – and Speed of Execution. </p><p>“A lot of people are trying to fix the same problems,” she said. “Being first doesn’t always matter. Velocity and speed of execution can overcome that.” I swear I didn’t tell her about the Path Dependence thesis. </p><p>“Seeing someone shipping at that velocity Ramp did, interacting in the same way Ramp did with customers,” she added. “It’s Ramp’s playbook.” </p><p><span>The playbook is actually fairly simple, if hard to execute: </span><strong>get insanely smart people who work obsessively hard on a hard problem in a big market pointed in the right direction for the future.</strong></p><p>Ishan credits the small size and high caliber of the team with the company’s velocity.

More than pedigree, though, there’s something about a small team of people at the top of their game executing rapidly and responsively with customers that’s hard to describe but obvious to observe. Rox has it. </p><p>That kind of team is insanely productive. It’s the kind of team that Rox is today, and wants to help more of the best companies become and remain in the future. </p><h3><strong>The Future of the Free Market </strong></h3><p><span>I knew I liked Ishan pretty quickly once I started talking to him, but I </span><em>really </em><span>knew when he described himself as an “owner/operator/capitalist,” and said this: </span></p><p><strong>“My life is about driving productivity in the free market.”</strong><span> </span></p><p>He had, he told me, “a visceral understanding of the impact of technology on humans.” </p><p>When New Relic acquired his startup, Pixie, he ran product before realizing that if he wanted to change the company’s fortunes, he’d have to change how it sold. He became Chief Revenue Officer. </p><p><span>When he took over, the company was doing $800 million in subscription revenue. But he saw the writing on the wall for subscription-based businesses, so he drove that business to zero while </span><strong>building up a $1 billion consumption-based business, </strong><em><strong>as a public company, during COVID</strong></em><span>. </span></p><p>As part of the transformation, he took his team from 1,600 people to 600 people… and grew sales by 30%. He earned a lesson: “There are a lot of folks who unfortunately need to be reskilled or are not critical. You can make the best quota-carrying people more productive, and then employ fewer people.” </p><p>Harsh truth, but if your goal is to drive productivity in the free market, an important one. </p><p><span>The Acquired guys are</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/226e0a60-2f27-433f-adda-9789e9da5e56?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"> fond of saying</a><span> that “companies are just founders extended… It’s very hard for me to point to a truly great company where the DNA isn’t like a lever on the founder’s personality.”</span></p><p>While it’s early in Rox’s journey, it’s clear that Rox is Ishan extended, and Rox is a leveraged way for Ishan to drive productivity in the free market. So understanding Ishan’s vision is instructive in determining what the future might look like if Rox succeeds. </p><p><span>To that end, there’s another 40% stat that I’ve been saving. When we first spoke, Ishan pointed out that </span><strong>“40% of business spend is GTM.”</strong><span> It is a huge chunk of the global economy. </span></p><p>Rhetorically, he asked, “Can they be 5-10% more efficient? Can we return 5-10% savings to the CEO and the CEO.” </p><p><span>Confidently, he answered, “I’ve done that, twice, at scale, </span><em>without</em><span> a fully built-out system like Rox.” </span></p><p>With Rox, he thinks, the efficiency gains will be more dramatic. Smaller teams, more revenue, higher margins. Grunt work: eliminated. Human touch: elevated. </p><p>This is where I started asking him questions like, “What are we all going to do with ourselves in the future?” And, “Will all sales just be bot-to-bot.” </p><p><span>Some of it will be, he thinks, but there will be human winners, those with the “</span><strong>creative force</strong><span>.” </span></p><p>“Most businesses have a few people coming up with change and driving it,” he says. “They will get more and more empowered.” </p><p>Within revenue teams specifically, he plans to drive this empowerment with Rox. </p><p><span>As we’ve discussed, the </span><em>proximate</em><span> goal right now, while AI isn’t that good yet, is just to earn the data and integrations, to become the system of record. Over the next year, he wants to save sellers 20 to 30 hours every week while making them 50% more effective. </span></p><p><span>But that’s not the </span><em>ultimate </em><span>goal. </span></p><p><strong>The ultimate goal is to use that data to train models on what and how the best companies at the best sellers sell in order to deliver full automation, when the time is right, for the things that the best humans don’t need to do so that they have the tools and resources to amplify what they do best.</strong><span>  </span></p><p>The models aren’t there yet, but they’ll get there. Everything other than building relationships and educating customers – the non-human stuff – will mostly be delivered by agents.</p><p>The opportunity for Rox is building the best team and best product with tech-forward customers to own the application layer for this as underlying models get good enough to fulfill the grand promises companies are making about their capabilities today. </p><p>This is another update to my mental model of AI: even as the foundation models themselves get smarter, there’s reason to believe that there will be a ton of value in the application layer.</p><p>Intelligence doesn’t equal usefulness. Here’s a thought exercise that one of Rox’s investors put to me: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>If you hired a 160 IQ college grad, they wouldn’t be able to do much on Day 1. If you spent a year training them, they could probably start doing good things. That’s what the application layer is: guiding super intelligent models to work in context. </span><strong>The broad opportunity at the application layer is building the data and workflows to make AI useful.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Even in my first conversation with Ishan, I was convinced Rox had what it takes to win, that by playing the long game, it could build the data and workflows to make AI useful to sellers. </p><p>That’s why I kept asking if he had a hard stop, so I could flood him with questions about the future he saw so clearly, the one that he’s working to bring about. </p><p><span>One category of questions was, essentially, </span><strong>if everyone uses Rox, is there any alpha in Rox?</strong><span> </span></p><p>If every company had access to really smart, really useful sales agents, wouldn’t the advantage disappear? </p><p>Wouldn’t the customers just get hit with the same perfectly targeted messages at the same perfect time? </p><p>Wouldn’t customers just be overwhelmed with equally good messages and ignore all of them?</p><p><span>Would all sales just be bots selling to bots based on product specs? Wouldn’t developer</span><em> </em><span>agents working with sales agents just build solutions tailored to those specs? </span></p><p>What are us humans going to do with ourselves when the AI takes our jobs? </p><p>Pulling me out of my existential tailspin, Ishan told me he believes that there will inevitably be winners and losers. </p><p><span>“</span><strong>The alpha will be an arbitrage on information</strong><span>: what information you have about your customers and how proactive you are in using it,” he explained. </span></p><p>Information is half the battle – the best companies will have more and better customers, so they’ll have more and better information, and their advantage will compound. </p><p>The other half is what you do with it. For that, the human element remains.</p><p>“Non-killers are going to go away,” he predicts, “and killers are going to be supercharged. It’s the same with companies: I do believe that there is a class of companies that will not survive.” </p><p>What will those companies look like? </p><p><strong>“You need to judge by the person driving the bus.”</strong><span> </span></p><p>The world in which Rox succeeds is not a world in which humans disappear. It is a world in which humans are amplified, for better or worse. </p><p>Rox will succeed because Ishan and the small, exceptional team he’s built will wield agents to amplify their human strengths. </p><p>The Acquired framing is useful here: companies are just founders extended. Great companies are force multipliers on their founders’ vision and capabilities. </p><p><span>With tools like Rox, </span><em>everyone</em><span> will be extended. Agents will be force multipliers on your vision and capabilities. </span></p><p>What became clear to me early in my conversations with Ishan is that Rox is a master class in Applied AI strategy: how to manufacture path dependence by taking the long view and matching current capabilities to future aspirations. </p><p>What’s become clear to me writing this piece is that those same lessons might apply to people, too. </p><p>A world full of highly capable agents is coming. The best will get better. But you know it’s coming. You can make your own luck if you take the long view and double-down on your unique capabilities today in anticipation of their future amplification. </p><p>Pretty heady stuff for a piece on boring CRM software!</p><p>Thanks to Claude for editing and to Ishan, Eric, Max, Kiran, and everyone else who shared their insights for this piece! </p><p>That’s all for today. Have a great Thanksgiving. We’ll be back in your inbox with a Weekly Dose on Friday. </p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>Packy</p></div>",

There can be balance sheet issues, e.g., too much debt, too much interest expense, breached covenants (where they exist, lol), unrefinanceable maturities. There can be operational issues, e.g., supply chain problems or inflationary pressures that push up the cost of inputs and/or wages. Maybe there are secular issues — like when an industry is in the midst of getting disrupted and no longer has a justifiable business model. There can be externalities like a crushing amount of litigation or brutal judgment. There are obviously others, but the aforementioned flavors are the most popular.\r\n\r\nThere are outliers — you know, weird “factors leading to chapter 11” that you’ll occasionally read in a set of chapter 11 bankruptcy “first day” papers. Like, 🤷‍♀️, “we had to file for bankruptcy because we became the target of an investigation alleging that we’re f*cking scumbags who enslave children.” That’s not one you see everyday.</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ce14e239-b6a7-425a-91ec-19e8e5662f3f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_320,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51862bc9-5e14-44f8-b2e9-3929f8431988_285x285.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Pardon us: we must have been in a mood.

The company, under the name H-Food Holdings LLC, has $350mm of 8.5% ‘26 unsecured notes outstanding (which sits behind a ~$200mm ‘24 RCF, a $1.7b ‘25 first lien term loan and a $300mm second lien loan). The notes were already under pressure in ‘22 — thank you rising wage costs, labor instability, and supply chain issues — before rebounding somewhat in ‘23 after news broke that the lenders might pursue a liability management transaction with Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and PJT Partners ($PJT) leading the charge. Consequently, Moody’s and S&amp;P Ratings rated the notes Caa2 and CCC (outlook negative) — and that was before this sh*t went down. Last week the notes were pricing in the low 70s with a 21+% yield. Suffice it to say the market reaction was fast and furious and the notes dipped into the low 60s on the news and the yield hit nearly 27%.</code></code></pre><p><span>Interestingly, Hearthside and </span><strong>The U.S. Department of Labor </strong><span>— which commenced a still-ongoing investigation into the company at the time — intimately know each other.

The Company vigorously disputes the bases for the allegations raised by the New York Times, but the effects of that article were immediate and severe: adverse media attention, customer scrutiny, and a series of investigations begun by different government bodies.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the Company responded forcefully to review, assess, and further enhance its own labor policies and practices. The Company has made significant investments to ensure its ability to provide a strong employee base that is fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations, including by substantially reducing its use of third-party staffing agencies and ensuring that all employees are subject to appropriate identification, eligibility, and verification procedures. Additionally, the Company has been fully cooperative and actively engaged with government officials and regulators. Although certain of these government investigations remain ongoing, the Company does not expect such investigations to result in material judgments, fines, or penalties, if any; but the ultimate amounts cannot be predicted with any certainty.”</code></code></pre><p>Wow. That’s quite the impressive way of making something awfully salacious sound rather benign. </p><p>Fine, we’ll bite and move on. </p><p>Actually, hang on. These things have to be related, right? </p><pre><code><code>“Significant wage rate increases connected to overall inflation growth has adversely affected the Company’s financials. In the last three years, wage rates have increased by 17.2% in the aggregate compared to 2021.

Of note: </p><pre><code><code>“In 2023, the Company sold its European nutritional functional bars business which generated approximately €235.0 million, with such cash proceeds held by ROS B.V., the Company’s Dutch unrestricted subsidiary. In July 2024, the Company repatriated approximately $187.9 million of the cash proceeds to Hearthside Sub, LLC, (the “US Unsub”), which for the avoidance of doubt, is not an obligor or guarantor on the Company’s prepetition debt.”</code></code></pre><p>We recall hearing rumors that this transaction had created a great deal of consternation among the term lenders back in Q4’23. In particular, they were worried that the now-debtors and sponsors had conspired to transfer the assets of the European bar business to an unrestricted subsidiary so that the proceeds wouldn’t necessarily be available to lenders. Stick a pin in this, folks, because it becomes relevant again when we discuss how the cases will be financed. </p><p>About the filing. There’s a restructuring support agreement (“RSA”) supported by approximately 81.2% of the first lien lenders, 100% of the second lien term lenders, and 77.7% of the senior unsecured notes. Last we checked the first lien term loan was in the low 60s and, well, you can see where the unsecured notes are: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d7b1be22-06b0-49aa-b359-e4d069c1d16d?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2592,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26bb2dcf-0716-464a-a03e-c02607030a87_1296x744.png\"></a></figure></div><p>There’s a reason for that. The value breaks clearly at the first lien term loan level. And so it is a group of first lien lenders who are driving the bus here. </p><p>The RSA has a number of primary features. </p><p>📍DIP Financing (“DIP”). The debtors will seek to use cash collateral on hand ($212.9mm, which includes the repatriated money from the US Unsub) and seek approval of an additional $300mm DIP at a second day hearing ($150mm new money + a rollup of some of the 1L TL dollar-for-dollar). The new money portion is at cash pay SOFR + 8.5%; the roll-up is at the same rate on a PIK basis (but the PIK will be waived if RSA transaction gets done). Fees include 2.5% and 1.5% commitment and exit fees, respectfully — both on new money only. </p><p><span>📍Exit Financing + 1L Recovery. As we alluded to above, the first lien term lenders are getting completely equitized. That’s right, they’ll get 100% of the post-reorg equity (subject to dilution from an equity rights offering, “ERO,” and a management incentive plan). But they also get to participate in a $825mm exit TL ‘30 S+650 (2% floor, cash pay, 1% amort). As you might expect, not everyone got to be part of the 1L Ad Hoc Group (“1L AHG”) that’s backstopping the DIP. While all of the 1L guys will be able to elect into the DIP, they won’t get the same sweet sweeeeeeeeeet economics the 1L AHG guys are getting. Namely, the ability to backstop the proposed $200mm ERO at a 35% discount to implied equity value of $470mm (implying a total enterprise value of $1.4b upon emergence). The 1L AHG guys benefit from an allocated 35% ERO holdback (the other 65% is available to all 1L term lenders on a pro rata basis, </span><em>including</em><span> the ERO backstop parties). If you’re wondering what that means, it means that the 1L AHG gets the benefit of the DIP economics, the ERO holdback, the other 65% ERO piece, the pretty attractive minimum 8.5% cash pay term loan, AND a 10% backstop fee paid in equity at discounted value. When all is said and done, the post-reorg balance sheet will feature (a) a $300-375mm ‘30 Exit ABL (with interest rate TBD “subject to third-party financing process”), and the $825mm exit term loan.

More specifically, the Debtors do not yield economic benefits from the CareMax-Steward Contracts. The Medicare VBC Contracts and CareMax-Steward Contracts are structured such that CareMax earns a significant profit from the time and resources expended by the Debtors and their Providers while the Debtors only receive a limited amount of such earnings from the provision of services, including the transition services that are necessary for CareMax to profit from the Medicare VBC Contracts. Further, CareMax, who is experiencing its own financial distresses, has failed to perform its payment obligations under its transition services agreement with the Debtors.”</code></code></pre><p>And when the debtors started exploring strategic alternatives, one of the discussed options was a sale of the MSO business. But the business was so inextricably intwined with Steward that potential buyers were unwilling to participate without the cooperation of Steward. Thus, in ‘23, the debtors and Steward teamed up and jointly marketed CareMax’s MSO business and Steward’s managed care business, Stewardship Health.

The purchase agreement was entered into on November 17 (same day as the filings) and will see the debtors receive $10mm in cash along with a portion of future Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) payments. Luckily there’s a fiduciary out clause the debtors could exercise if a better offer pops up during bankruptcy but the debtors will have to eat a $2mm break-up fee.</span></p><p>With the MSO business transaction done and dusted, the debtors have been marketing their remaining 40 value-based care medical centers in Florida (the “core centers”).

However, risky credits with high leverage and low interest coverage ratios, will continue to struggle. Distressed companies that restructured through distressed exchanges in recent years without cutting debt to sustainable levels can default again.”</code></code></pre><p>Music to RX professionals’ ears! </p><p>But it gets better. Moody’s was talking about the rosiest of scenarios. Moody’s wants to manage expectations given macroeconomic and geopolitical risks out there: </p><pre><code><code>“While our baseline scenario does not expect a sharp increase in corporate default rates over the next 12 months, certain economic and financial developments outside our baseline expectations could lead to a higher default rate. Therefore, we have also developed moderately pessimistic and severely pessimistic scenarios, which may unfold if one or more of the following were to crystallize: greater macroeconomic disruption because of geopolitical risks; growing protectionism including larger tariffs that lead to greater disruption in trade and supply chains, causing inflation re-acceleration and a sharper global economic slowdown; and stress in any part of the financial sector (e.g., commercial real estate) that spills over into the economy more broadly. \r\n\r\nUnder our moderately pessimistic scenario, the US high-yield spread would widen to as much as 926 bps in the coming four quarters and the unemployment rate would rise to 8.3%. Under this scenario, the global speculative-grade default rate would increase to 5.9% by the end of October 2025. Our severely pessimistic scenario assumes even weaker macroeconomic conditions, with a surge in the US high-yield spread to as much as 1,232 bps and a jump in the unemployment rate to 8.9%. Under this scenario, the global speculative grade default rate would rise to 9.6% in a year, reaching the peak level after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.”</code></code></pre><p>Whoa.

After raising guidance last quarter, TGT lowered guidance back down — and the market punished them accordingly. Management here seems to … how should we put this … suck.

While flight data did not indicate a chopstick-catch landing was possible, the launch was still successful in all other regards.</p><p>The mission successfully tested Starship's reentry capabilities, including modifications to its heat shield and engine relight in microgravity, while also achieving a controlled splashdown of both stages. These advancements are critical for developing a fully reusable spacecraft capable of supporting lunar landings, Mars missions, and whatever other civilization-altering missions the company has planned.</p><p>It’s amazing that the company has turned launching and safely landing Starships into an almost common occurrence in such a short amount of time. As a reminder, Starship is over 400 feet tall, is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, and dwarfs the Statue of Liberty. We can now launch the Statue of Liberty into space and land it safely back on earth, and it’s not even a big news story anymore.</p><p>Elon is on an all-time heater.

His aggressive austerity measures have delivered astounding results: achieving a fiscal surplus for the first time in over a decade and reducing monthly inflation to below 3%, the lowest in three years. His administration has already removed or significantly amended over 300 regulations, and now alters around five regulations per day with the goal of making changes to over 4,000 laws. You may not like his style, but the results speak for themselves.</p><p><span>You may be asking yourself, “Why should I care about what the President of Argentina is up to?” The answer is pretty clear: Milei’s approach to government efficiency and deregulation is serving as the playbook for the US Government’s forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) Don’t take my word for it — both Musk and Milei are on record stating as much.

The original conversation occurred between an English speaking Lex, a Spanish speaking Milei, and an interpreter. But the podcast was presented using an overdub from ElevenLabs that made it sound like a fully English conversation between Lex and Milei. It was a very high-quality overdub and, if Lex had not broken it down at the beginning of the podcast, I am not sure I would’ve picked up that Milei’s voice was AI-generated.</span></p></li></ol><p><em>Yang et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>By coupling a bulk acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, the authors engineered a parameter regime in which a mechanical mode of the resonator inherits the nonlinear features of the superconducting qubit necessary for strong phonon-phonon interactions. They then demonstrated a full set of single-qubit operations on their mechanical qubit.</em></p></blockquote><p>Researchers have created a new type of qubit using mechanical vibrations, called a mechanical qubit, by coupling a resonator to a superconducting qubit. As a reminder, a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information, capable of existing in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) for advanced computing and information processing. </p><p>The mechanical qubit allowed them to engineer strong interactions between phonons (quantized sound waves) at the single-quantum level, something previously impossible in mechanical systems. They demonstrated full control of the qubit, including initialization and quantum gates, with the system showing remarkably long quantum lifetimes. </p><p>If you didn’t understand that, you’re not alone — here’s why it matters: the breakthrough opens the door to using quantum sound for advanced technologies like highly sensitive sensors, powerful simulations, and efficient quantum computers.

Muscarinic receptors are proteins in the brain and body that respond to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and play a key role in cognition, movement, and other physiological functions. KarXT approval for schizophrenia has renewed interest in targeting muscarinic receptors for other brain conditions, such as Alzheimer’s.</span></p><p><span>Targeting muscarinic receptors, particularly the </span><strong>M1 subtype</strong><span>, could help treat Alzheimer’s by enhancing acetylcholine signaling, which is crucial for learning and memory. Activation of M1 receptors has been shown to improve cognitive function and may slow neurodegeneration by supporting brain cell communication and reducing the buildup of harmful proteins like beta-amyloid and tau. Importantly, this approach would not only treat existing symptoms of Alzheimer’s but may also address the underlying diseases.</span></p><p><span>We’re still pretty long ways away, though. Other muscarinic receptors drugs have failed to pass through trials. The challenge is due to the difficulty of selectively targeting specific receptor subtypes (like M1) without causing widespread side effects, as these receptors are found throughout the body. That said, the FDA’s approval KarXT </span><strong> </strong><span>has revitalized confidence in muscarinic receptor-targeting drugs and their potential for treating a wide variety of brain-related conditions.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/10825166-05fd-4b08-ab07-d7c0b7a333f2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">@SECGov</a><span> Chair.</span></em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9b31f722-6b7f-4744-8411-37354f1efd7c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1204,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ba36909-630f-47f6-8f5a-a826d85d32ab_602x242.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Packy here.

Bitcoin is a store of value. Stablecoins are better money infrastructure, as evidenced by Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge. Polymarket played a significant role in the 2024 US Presidential election (and got it more right than the media and pollsters). The idea that there are no use cases is dead.

FCM Fuel looms largest among these projects. “</span><em>FCM Fuel consists of Tri-structural ISOtropic (“TRISO”) fuel particles embedded inside a silicon carbide matrix.” </em><span>Just nod your heads, folks. </span></p><p><span>The debtors have “</span><em>developed unique and proprietary commercial scale equipment” </em><span>to produce these sinister yet Gaia-saving globules, much of it housed in their </span><em>Pilot Fuel Manufacturing Facility </em><span>in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

No, it is not the size of a hot-water heater.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Now, just think about the MMR as a </span><em>“‘nuclear battery,’” with 15.7 billion kilowatt- hours of thermal energy (kWth) during its lifetime,” </em><span>Terrani writes. The MMR boasts any number of forward-looking features. It’s modular, you can build it with off-the-shelf parts, and it does not require water or an electrical grid or infrastructure</span><em>. “The MMR’s ability to provide reliable but variable baseload power also makes it an ideal complement to other forms of renewable energy (such as wind and solar) to create new and more efficient renewable micro grids.”</em><span> In other words: if you’re building a wind/solar plant, make sure you get a MMR for backup power. Nuclear is reliable; the wind and sun are more fickle. </span></p><p><span>The MMR is currently in the licensing stage with authorities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. But there’s a lot more FFM Fuel can do besides feed the MMR. It’s suitable for most reactor types. The debtors once created a special version for the </span><strong>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</strong><span>, “…</span><em>as the agency seeks to develop technologies for nuclear-powered space propulsion.”</em></p><p><span>That came as a surprise. Who knew NASA was still in the </span><em>“space exploration” </em><span>business? Well, Houston, the debtors have you covered. First up is the </span><em>Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Engine (“NTP”</em><span>), which uses nuclear fission to heat up a gas, which is then spit through a nozzle to produce thrust. Terrani says</span><em> </em><span>it will get astronauts to Mars </span><em>“significantly faster”</em><span> than chemical propulsion, </span><em>“thereby decreasing astronauts’ exposure to cosmic and solar radiation.” </em></p><p><span>The thing — which bears a suggestive resemblance to the Monolith from </span><strong>Stanley Kubrick</strong><span>’s classic </span><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em><span> — is a </span><em>“10-ton class micro reactor that builds on the MMR and FCM Fuel technologies.” </em><span>This puppy is built for travel too; it is particularly suitable for “</span><em>off-grid locations” </em><span>… which is to say, it is “…</span><em>a viable solution to provide critical energy to defense applications such as the U.S. military’s forward operating bases.”</em><span> The screenplay writes itself: you and your regiment of Space Grenadiers are underway in your NTP-powered space fleet to some distant galaxy to … defend democracy, or something. The troops gotta have their Netflix and Instagrams. What better to charge those gadgets than a Python or two? The debtors </span><em>understand the assignment</em><span>, as the kids say. </span></p><p><span>All so ultra-cool. </span><em>“Dream big,”</em><span> we’re told, and by damn, these debtors did. But sometimes there’s this lag between the dream and when the eagle screams (aka, the conversion of dreams into hard cash). Sure thing, the debtors are </span><em>“actively engaged” </em><span>with NASA, the </span><strong>Department of Energy </strong><span>(“DOE”) and the </span><strong>Department of Defense</strong><span> (“DOD”). “</span><em>However, aside from the Pilot Fuel Manufacturing Facility for production of FCM Fuel and TRISO particles, many of the Debtors’ products are still being developed, and, as a result, the Debtors’ historical revenue is low compared to operating losses.” </em><span>Well, we were wondering about that “commercial” reference. So how bad is it? In ‘23, the debtor booked $6.15mm of revenue compared to $81.2mm of expenses. In ‘22, revenues were $5.75mm, with operating expenses just short of 10x that, at $53.9mm. </span></p><p><span>The debtors historically depended on outside investors for funding, Terrani writes. And they were fortunate enough to have found a devoted, motivated and well-heeled backer: </span><strong>Richard Hollis Helms</strong><span>. Maybe he was a science-fiction fan. He sunk some $100mm of equity into the debtor. That equity is held by </span><strong>USNC Investment LLC</strong><span>, a non-operating SPV (“USNC”). Helms, through USNC, also loaned the debtors roughly $24.5mm under a senior secured convertible promissory facility (the “prepetition secured note”), under which $28.2mm of principal and interest remained due as of the petition date. </span></p><p>That’s a lot of money. </p><p>Who is this dude? </p><p><span>“</span><em>Richard Hollis Helms believed in the Debtors’ inventions and their mission to provide reliable and safe zero-carbon energy anywhere.” </em><span>Note the tense. </span></p><p><span>The </span><em>late</em><span> Richard Hollis Helms, alas. </span></p><p><span>The U.S. lost a true patriot and hero in March ‘24, but he lived a life that qualifies him as the World’s Most Interesting Man, next to which the likes of </span><strong>Napoleon Bonaparte </strong><span>are but pale caricatures. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b5153203-00df-409e-b4eb-0c2f711e10da?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_326,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ee9fa00-3c48-4118-9dae-1b16390ea2e4_500x500.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>That’s the picture painted by Helms, or </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/af087664-76b0-4459-bd90-24139ef9e235?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">whoever did his obituary</a><span>: an </span><em>“aviator, spy, entrepreneur, mentor, venture capitalist,”</em><span> he joined the </span><strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong><span> (“CIA”) as a security guard in the early ‘70s.

When the agency did not call on his and his colleagues' profound expertise after 9/11, he founded Abraxas Corporation for which he won the 2006 Ernst and Young National Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Emerging Technology. 10 years after it was created, Richard sold Abraxas and started Ntrepid Corporation which is still successfully developing cutting-edge software to save the world.\"</code></code></pre><p><span>“</span><em>Save the world</em><span>,” huh? How’d that go for you and your pals, Helms? Abraxas, you may recall (lol, jk), was an early entrant in the </span><em>“intelligence contracting”</em><span> industry — entities created, cynics might say, for the sole purpose of scarfing down the billions made available by the Patriot Act. This is what Ntrepid claims to do: </span><em>“…managed attribution technology solutions for the national security community.” </em><span>Well, we did wonder where Helms got his millions, and now we know.  </span></p><p><span>Helms had suffered various illnesses, Terrani writes, so in ‘22, they began working with </span><strong>Citibank NA ($C)</strong><span> to line up another sugar daddy. Citi knocked on the doors of </span><em>“asset managers, pension funds, utilities, family offices, large IT companies, corporate investment funds, and various other private equity funds.” </em><span>Plenty of interest, but all contingent on the debtors’ obtaining an anchor investor, Terrani said. They found one, but this investor was unable to raise sufficient funds. A Canadian labor pension fund kicked in $18mm, but that was it. By early ‘24, liquidity, or its absence, was reaching crisis proportions. </span></p><p><span>Helms had been board chairman. Dr. Venneri served as the board. When Helms died, the debtors reconstituted it: they added three new directors, asked Dr. Venneri to resign (which he did, effective July 31) and appointed Tanneri as Interim CEO on August 2. The new board’s task was obvious: address the liquidity issue. They retained advisors, including </span><strong>Intrepid Investment Bankers LLC </strong><span>(“Intrepid”). The board tasked Intrepid with drumming up the financing to carry them through a sales and marketing process. Intrepid contacted 38 lenders — a process hampered by the debtors’ “</span><em>lack of operating history, existing capital structure, and lack of traditional working capital collateral” —</em><span> but nevertheless managed to identify a helpful lender.</span></p><p><span>Some of Helms’ old pals at Langley, looking to honor the </span><em>“rock star’s”</em><span> memory?

It’s building something that works for mainstream artists and underground producers alike, something that both captures and expands the market.

The [untitled] team shares this obsession with craft - Dancho and José spent years iterating on the product until it felt right, initially frustrating investors who wanted faster deployment cycles. But like Ocean, when they finally shipped, they had built something artists fell in love with. </p><p>In an industry often forced to choose between artistic integrity and commercial success, [untitled] wants to achieve both.

Sounds a bit ridiculous, but we come from a Mexican community that immigrated from Mexico City to San Diego. Our parents knew each other from Mexico City. Our great grandparents, actually, we found out recently, used to be friends, and they used to go to the park together. We became really close over the fact that we're both the youngest of three siblings. Our older brothers were a huge inspiration for us musically. All of our older brothers were really obsessed with music. They were even in bands together. His brother used to drive my brothers to the concerts in San Diego.</span></em></p><p><em>To add to that, we also grew up like eight minutes away from each other, and developed very similar interests. We were both obsessed with music, and then we both became obsessed with technology and Apple and all this stuff, and it just kind of happened beyond us in some ways.

And then Dan's like, “I'm thinking about a way to be able to create your own clothing, like a fashion app, where I can just put in my own design, and then get that clothing shipped to my house.” And I was like, “Yeah, that sounds like a really cool idea.” We just kind of kept chatting from there. </span></em></p><p><em><strong>Dancho</strong><span>: That's the start of our book.

Back to Lisa Marie (emphasis mine): </p><p><em><strong>Lisa Marie:</strong><span> When did the idea for [untitled] first come into existence?</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Dancho:</strong><span> As we said, we've been obsessed with technology since we were kids, and we've been obsessed with music since we were kids. By the time we were in college, we were working with startups. So that's kind of like what we were doing professionally. We were doing internships, doing all that stuff, just trying to break into the tech world. In parallel, we started getting re-obsessed with music now as not just consumers, but actually making music. </span><strong>During my sophomore year of college, José started making music and he started sending it to me, and I was like, “Damn, this is cool.”</strong></em></p><p><em><span>He was making these awesome beats on his phone, and was sending them to me just for fun. </span><strong>I also started dabbling in making music on GarageBand.</strong><span> Around this time, José also introduced me to </span><strong>BROCKHAMPTON</strong><span>, who were a huge inspiration for us – seeing all these </span><strong>kids who were just making music in their bedroom.</strong></em></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/38745a55-a71f-445d-859b-2b483a736b7d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/sZd-t5-I5uA\"></a><p><em><span>Around the same time, we both had started to get some experience with helping out our friends who made music. My older brother is a musician, so I was helping him out with his group.</span><strong> As we got deeper into this world we became really frustrated with the tools that existed for that entire process. Especially coming from the startup world, we're so used to all these incredible productivity tools that exist for all these different industries. You have tools like Notion, you have tools like Figma, you have all these productivity tools.  In music it just felt like there weren't really beautiful tools built to help artists nurture and maximize their creative process. We decided that we wanted to build a company that had that at the core of its mission. So we built [untitled].</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>José:</strong><span> I think Dan and I realized that </span><strong>music is a four dimensional form of communication</strong><span>. It's just a way of communicating between one person and another. Sometimes friends send each other music. It's easier than sending like a 30 sentence paragraph over text on how they're feeling. You could just send a song and then immediately understand how they’re feeling.</span><strong> We all tend to think about music as this thing that you release to the world, but in reality, there's a lot of music being sent just between close friends. In fact, if an artist is releasing maybe, let's say, ten albums over the course of their career, which is maybe like 100 - 200 songs, then they've definitely made over 10,000 songs</strong><span>. A lot of that music gets sent to just a few people, whether it's your mom, your significant other, whatever. </span></em></p><p><em><span>For musicians, I think there's this pressure for the music that's released on DSPs. In reality, </span><strong>the other 9000 tracks that you haven't released are very valuable. They have intrinsic value. They have the spiritual value of your emotions, of who you are as a person. Artists shouldn't feel like they are beholden to experiencing their music in a predefined way. Sometimes fully materializing a song is just sending it to your mom or sending it to your friend or sending it to your bandmates. Right now, the mainstream concept of fully materializing your music is putting it on Spotify or on Apple Music.</strong></em></p><p><em><span>We saw this gap between the DAW and the DSPs. In the DAW, a song feels like it's still being worked on in terms of editing and production. On DSPs, it feels like it's already a finished product. </span><strong>We saw this space where you want your music to feel materialized without it being on a streaming service.</strong><span> When you bounce your music out of the DAW, where are you going to listen to it? A song doesn’t feel realized on the Files app and Dropbox. It feels like a random file. </span><strong>On [untitled], a song comes to life, and you can let it sit there without pressure.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Dan:</strong><span> It's really sad that for many artists pre-[untitled], they had to listen to their precious creation, their precious emotional output, on a product that does not really value it. Right? </span><strong>You put the song that you wrote after you were sad one evening because your girlfriend broke up with you on Dropbox or the Files app, and it literally just feels like any other file. It's sitting right next to this PDF that your boss sent you.</strong><span> It's like sitting right next to where my emotions are is this random PDF about my professional life. There isn't this sense of treating unreleased music sacredly. It's kind of bizarre that it's easier and more delightful to listen to someone else's song on Spotify than to one’s own music on whatever service you're using.</span><strong> [untitled] is designed to treat your unreleased music preciously, and be the best place to listen to it.</strong></em></p><p><span>I’m sorry for the long quote, but it’s better you hear it from them directly. Those are not emotions I feel. I don’t make music. I grew up pre-Spotify, and when Spotify came out, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/33fbccbb-f33a-454a-81f3-11f21cec85d3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">it was magic</a><span>. But they feel it, you can tell when you talk to them, that they really want to build something great for musicians and their teams, like really want to do that, and that means building a business, because to scale you need revenue and resources, but in a way that you don’t normally feel talking to people making tools for enterprise, the business, for Dancho &amp; José is in service of the customers. </span></p><p>So José left his job and Dancho decided not to get one after college and the two – I’m sorry, I’m going to have to apologize for the second time in two paragraphs – got the band back together.  </p><p>Thus came the tension that always comes for artists: you need money to create art.</p><h3><strong>Investing in Music</strong></h3><p><span>I’m being dramatic. Dancho &amp; José felt no conflict. But they </span><em>did </em><span>need money. </span></p><p><span>So in late 2020, they started talking to investors, and by early 2021, they closed a $900k pre-seed from two investors: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/929632f5-05f1-4ca6-9494-2b1cab4938fe?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Niko Bonatsos at General Catalyst</a><span>, who writes in his company bio, “My passion is working with first-time technology founders with strong product instincts” (✅, if you don’t count Squeezed, which is the aforementioned app the duo co-founded in 9th grade), and Adam Besvinick, at </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/03c622db-7485-4393-b5a6-52255d8799ce?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Looking Glass Capital</a><span>, who I introduced you to earlier and who introduced me to Dancho &amp; José. </span></p><p>At the time, Adam told me, his thesis was that “the fastest way to record any idea is speaking it. If [untitled] was the default way to record any idea, starting with music, that’s a powerful point of leverage for all sorts of other stuff.” Like me, Adam is not a musician, and he shared the app with a bunch of friends who aren’t musicians, and they all said, “Shit I’d use this. It’s way better than Apple Notes.” </p><p>Capturing ideas, running them through models (even the pre-GPT 2021 models), building more products on top of that data, suggesting other ideas, other things to explore… that was a big idea. </p><p>Hit pause. It doesn’t sound like a big idea from our perspective in late 2024. But [untitled] got started back in 2020, raised money in early 2021. This was a different time.

Ethan Daly, who works with Mo at Shine, thinks [untitled] potentially increases artists’ consumptive behavior. “Most musicians' favorite artist is themself and they love listening to their own music pre-release (this changes drastically once a song is out),” he told me, from experience. “I've even found myself listening to songs I'm working on 10x, 20x, 30x+ a day, both out of enjoyment and to make passive improvements, which I add to my track notes.” </p><blockquote><p><em><span>There is an ownership and obsession bestowed upon a song when you make it that I </span><strong>aggressively compare to having a child</strong><span>.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>“Can’t they just listen to their baby on Soundcloud or Spotify?” you might be asking. But these are WIP tracks, not ready for prime time. And continuous playback isn’t readily available in other storage products, which weren’t designed for music. Listening is clunky there, and you definitely can’t edit and take notes while you listen there, like you can in [untitled].</p><p>Playback was a hint that they were building something deeper, the glimmer of a full-stack music workflow product. </p><p>Listening went up every month, without much marketing, through Word of Mouth. “Oh shit,” Adam recalled thinking, “You’re seeing people using the product this way more than my original hypothesis.” </p><p>Then, the next question, maybe the question that so many investors have asked and answered that there’s still an opportunity to make a mobile app (!) for musicians (!) in 2024 (!): </p><p><strong>“If this is just a music thing, how big can it get?” </strong></p><h3><strong>The Music (Software) Business </strong></h3><p>Music software can be split into two categories:</p><ol><li><p>Consumption</p></li><li><p>Creation </p></li></ol><p><span>“Distribution is a third, in my opinion,” José told me, “However, on platforms where creation and consumption are both available and tightly coupled… </span><strong>distribution collapses</strong><span>.” </span></p><p><span>When I asked Dancho whether there actually was a Why Now for [untitled], he said there wasn’t a big technological one – “this probably could have come out any time post-iPhone” – but there actually </span><em>is </em><span>a business model one, about the interplay between consumption and creation. </span></p><p>And it goes a little something like this…  </p><p><span>Napster came out in 1999 and set off a dramatic decline in</span><em> </em><span>the music industry’s revenue as consumption shifted from CDs – which cost ~$18 and bundled songs you wanted with a bunch of others you had to pay for to get the ones you wanted – to downloads - which were free and a la carte. Even iTunes, which let you buy singles for $0.99, couldn’t make up for the gap, particularly when, even after the death of Napster, other free download services popped up to replace it.

Or, as Dancho colorfully summed it up, </span><strong>“Music is digital, people are ripping it, how the fuck do we make money?”</strong></p><p><span>New digital </span><strong>creation</strong><span> tools sprung up, too, DAWs like Ableton (2001) and Apple GarageBand (2004), the only two of the top six most-used DAWs </span><em>created this millennium</em><span>. Both were created in the beginning of the downtrend, when new digital technologies meant new ways to help artists create but before it became clear that other new technologies would mean that whatever they created, there might not be any market to sell to. </span></p><p>So first: get the money, without which DAWs would remain hobbyist tools. In other words, there was little appetite among the most talented entrepreneurs to build tools for an industry with declining revenues and no end in sight. Imagine the pitch: </p><p><strong>“We are disrupting the $500 million (and declining) music creation industry to serve the $10 billion (and declining) music industry!” </strong></p><p>And for that reason, I’m out. </p><p>Then came Spotify. Founded in 2006, launched in Sweden in 2008, came to America in 2011. Spotify was a miracle. I still remember the first time I used it. Every song. On-demand. Right on my phone. Free is really hard to compete with, but if there’s one thing that can compete with free, it’s convenient. For $9.99 a month, I didn’t have to go to Kazaa or Limewire, find a track, find a version I could download, hope it wasn’t corrupted, hope it didn’t give my computer a virus, or transfer it from my computer to my phone. I didn’t have to pay $1 per track to iTunes. Anywhere I was, I could just search and hit play. </p><p>You all know the Spotify story, so I won’t repeat it, but the punchline is: it worked. The recorded music industry’s revenue actually started growing again. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/05ef7f56-2618-430b-ad17-eff09d403dff?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F610f95c2-9cf6-485d-91a0-d51e7f84dad0_908x728.png\"></a><figcaption><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/00725694-b0a6-4e0b-8a85-7be18ebd0546?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">RIAA</a><span> </span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Spotify solved consumption to the tune of a $92B market cap.

Mission – while still, always, a WIP – accomplished. </p><p>The plan was to get that usage from musicians, then turn those numbers into charts to prove to investors that musicians loved the app, to get the money to go out and build deeper into the Music OS stack, like that hydraulic press, slowly crunching the fragmented landscape of music tools into one app. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/285ce79b-4f73-4528-b3fc-db50421f06f3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1820,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c2b6ff-75af-4f7a-8b3b-e68d777715dc_910x455.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Then something even better happened. </p><p>Olivia said that the firm met Dancho &amp; José in early 2021, had been following it since, and started to see the website and app pick up a lot of steam in the external data, which piqued her interest. </p><p>What got her even more interested, though, were the pings. </p><p><span>a16z has a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ae0bc061-d9e3-4cca-961b-afbf9e337704?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Cultural Leadership Fund</a><span> whose mission is “Connecting the world’s greatest cultural leaders to the best new technology companies.” Specifically, the fund’s LPs consist of Black artists, athletes, and leaders including Pharrell Williams, The Weekend, Lionel Richie, Kevin Durant, Patrick Mahomes, Shonda Rhimes, Chance the Rapper, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, Quincy Jones, and Nas. </span></p><p><span>“The bar for non-professional investors to notice a product, then notice that it’s a startup, then reach out,” she said, “is high. But </span><strong>we started getting pings from professional artists telling us that [untitled] was the next big thing in music.</strong><span>”</span></p><p>See what I mean? Isn’t that way better than just showing an investor that artists use your product with a graph? </p><p><span>Based on the pings and the data, Anish and Olivia reached out to reopen the conversation with Dancho &amp; José this spring. It was a good conversation, but </span><strong>a16z initially passed</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Then Anish, a musician himself, spent more time on the app. And he was blown away. </p><p>“I spend a lot of time obsessing on products and product details. Most companies have one big insight and a lot of little things supporting that,” he explained. “This one is unusual because there are 30 insights. I’d text the guys ‘It would be amazing if you could do this,’ and they already had.” </p><p>Anish kept playing. He discovered someone who put an [untitled] track on twitter, started using it from the consumption perspective, and it was a totally different consumption experience than anything he’d had. </p><p>“The playlist is such a disappointing atomic unit,” Anish thinks. “They suck. [untitled] is something else that allows you to play around in a different way.” More mixtape than playlist, but still, a different, third thing. </p><p><span>As a musician, he took one of his tracks and threw it on [untitled]: “I dropped the track in, shared it with a few people. I could do stem separation, one swipe away.” Here. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/02654026-ae70-4e3f-9c8b-c31182a37973?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">I’ll share it with you, too</a><span>.

It was fine – they weren’t raising, they didn’t </span><em>need </em><span>the money – they just didn’t think it was happening. </span></p><p>“A few days after they passed – 12 days after that,” Dancho recounted: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>We get an email from Anish saying, something like, “Hey guys, I’ve been using your app for the past week, I’m obsessed, want to make something happen.” He fully apologized. </span><strong>“I’ve never done this where I passed and wanted to make something happen, but I’m in love with your app and want to make something happen.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Then he made something happen. </span><strong>a16z led an $18 million Series A.</strong></p><p>Which is a fun thing to be able to say about a portfolio company, but really, is the money Dancho, José, and their absurdly small 7-person team need to start building down the stack. </p><p>Because sitting at the “top of the Musical Creator Stack” is just the right entry point to go further down, to “vertically integrate the entire music stack for artists.” </p><p>Remember, though, when Adam said that it wasn’t clear if that was even technically possible? </p><p>“You need to ask them to see the latest design,” he told me. “It’s an extremely feature-rich product designed in a way that doesn’t feel overwhelming at all. I don’t know how they’ve done it.” </p><p>Of course, Adam is an [untitled] investor. He’s supposed to say nice things for public consumption. But he also said it wasn’t always like this. </p><p>“There was a long period where it was extremely frustrating,” he told me. “They treated the product like a Faberge Egg that they didn’t want to break. They didn’t want to get it into the hands of users to tell them it sucked.” Adam, Mo, and Niko had to push Dancho &amp; José into the deep end: “You need to ship faster and you need to get user feedback in tighter loops because development cycles aren’t happening quickly enough.” </p><p>There’s always that tension, in music, between art and capital. The artist wants it to be perfect. The capitalist wants it to make money. It’s clear talking to Dancho &amp; José, and hearing these stories, that they lean artist. Which is probably why the product is so damn good in an age when most apps kind of suck. </p><p>But once again, you need money to make the art, and you need crowds to tell you if it’s any good. </p><p>So they listened. This is the back half of 2023. And they put the product in musicians’ hands, afraid that they were going to have their feelings hurt, and … they didn’t. Musicians loved it. They realized they built something that people actually wanted, lots of people. They combined the artists’ sensitivity with the capitalists’ speed, and tightened that craft, ship, iterate loop, and that’s why, in the spring of 2024, the product was growing fast enough and gaining enough popularity – even among the big time artists backing the Cultural Leadership Fund – that a16z took notice and wrote them a check. </p><p>Which is why they can build more of the OS, now, which Dancho showed me the other day. </p><h3><strong>The Operating System for Music</strong></h3><p>“We’re not ready to show this to a lot of people yet,” Dancho warned, “but I’ll show you what we have.” </p><p>Describing the app in words is, at best, like trying to get you to appreciate a song by reading you the lyrics in monotone. Maybe I’ll start with some OS philosophy, which does work in words.</p><p>“If you think about an Operating System” – this is how Dancho started the demo, and I think gives a hint as to why this team is so good at product – “It has a bunch of different apps that do the different things you need.”</p><blockquote><p><em>The beauty of an OS is that</em></p><p><em>If I don’t need something </em></p><p><em>It’s not in the way. </em></p><p><em>Philosophically,</em></p><p><em>That’s what we wanted to achieve</em></p><p><em>Adding more creative tools. </em></p><p><em>Offering a lot of tools</em></p><p><em>While keeping the app simple</em></p><p><em>So the tool doesn’t get in the way</em></p><p><em>When you don’t need it. </em></p><p><em>DAWs have a lot.</em></p><p><em>They’re overwhelming.</em></p><p><em>We want to be </em></p><p><em>Powerful</em></p><p><em>Yet simple</em></p><p><em>At the same time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Then he showed me. It’s like three little apps: Notes, Edit, Record. </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong><span> to write down lyrics, jot down ideas for collaborators and fans. </span></p><p><strong>Record:</strong><span> self-explanatory.

One telling anecdote: songs have gotten shorter in recent years (the chart on the left) for a very specific reason: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, </span><strong>this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties. </strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Even better, the same listener can listen to your two-minute song two times in four minutes, but can only listen to your four-minute song once in four minutes. So shorter songs get more plays, and therefore higher rankings on the charts and more revenue. This, Ball explains, is one of the reasons Lil Nas X’s 1:53 </span><em>Old Town Road</em><span> was the top track of 2019. </span></p><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png\"></div><img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736239187793c9e492e687db01\"><p>Old Town Road</p><p>Lil Nas X</p><p>If [untitled] succeeds, what might the new model look like? </p><p>The way that Dancho &amp; José see it, making it easier to share and discover WIP tracks is a way for artists to test their music, and fans to find new music, en route to the traditional path to labels and DSPs. Sharing and getting feedback, in this scenario, means that artists are more likely to release polished final tracks that appeal to their fans, who will consume where they currently consume, on Spotify or TikTok. And that may be the case. </p><p>But I wonder if that vision of the future is less radical than the one that might come to pass. </p><p>Ethan at Shine told me that while social sharing for both professional musicians and novices might feel like a stepping stone to the DSPs, “many users prefer to end the journey here rather than watching their music get lost in the shuffle of streaming platforms and monthly listener counts dwindling to zero.” </p><p>There’s a version of the [untitled] discography – not yet fully created, still to come – in which the company shakes up the music industry more than even its founders are willing to dream. To pick up the faint sounds of that future, we’re going to have to flip to the B-Side. </p><h3><strong>B-Side: Strategic Analysis</strong></h3><p>If you view the music industry as something frozen in amber in the early 2000s, then you might expect that now, now that people are building tools for music creators again, the industry may speedrun the changes that have taken place to most other industries whose products could be digitized. </p><p><span>In</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ac638932-80c2-4528-95e3-4a70daec8084?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ac638932-80c2-4528-95e3-4a70daec8084?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vertical Integrators</a></em><span>, I talked about why there won’t be any more Aggregators:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The short version is that Aggregators had already won the biggest categories that were susceptible to Aggregators, and that the remaining categories were too small to support the necessary model: spend a lot upfront, and make it back on small margin dollars over a huge amount of transactions.</em></p><p><em>One addition to that hypothesis is that Aggregators worked for categories that were either digital – and therefore where marginal costs for new supply was practically zero – or where supply already existed, like cars or homes. Better allocating those existing resources was a coordination problem – an information problem – and therefore susceptible to Aggregators.</em></p></blockquote><p>The more I think about it, the more I think music might prove me wrong. </p><p><span>Music is a funny category from the perspective of Aggregators. In 2017’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9590f942-2fe9-4606-8a6c-7f02badf5a7a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Great Unbundling</a></em><span>, Ben Thompson wrote that the music industry had surprisingly ended up in pretty good shape, ultimately and ironically undisrupted by the internet: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>While piracy drove the music labels into the arms of Apple, which unbundled the album into the song, streaming has rewarded the integration of back catalogs and new music with bundle economics: more and more users are willing to pay $10/month for access to everything, significantly increasing the average revenue per customer.

Unlike newspapers, music labels built an integration that transcends distribution.</em></p></blockquote><p>Back then, he didn’t think of Spotify as an Aggregator because it had to pay so much of its margin to the record labels. It had failed to commoditize the labels. </p><p><span>In 2022’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2254f575-bb53-4840-91ec-966925f3a74c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Spotify, Netflix, and Aggregation</a></em><span>, Thompson changes his mind, arguing that while Spotify hadn’t made content acquisition </span><em>free</em><span>, it had commoditized content and shifted the power from owning supply to owning demand. In a world of abundant, zero-distribution-cost music, controlling the “best means to surface the content users want” is a valuable place to sit. Spotify started to put a price on that value, Thompson noted, in the form of “promotion,” or advertising. </span></p><p>Spotify, he realized, was more of an Aggregator than he thought. </p><p><span>What’s interesting about other Aggregators – particularly Level 3 Aggregators with zero supply costs like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube – didn’t just change the nature of supply, </span><strong>they changed what supply looked like and who could be a supplier</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Twitter, for example, didn’t just aggregate news stories from professional journalists, it turned anyone into a kind of micro-journalist. It made it really easy to get your written thoughts in front of a large audience and expanded the pool of people who could do so. </p><p>Ditto Google and Facebook, both of which aggregated traditional journalism as it moved online, but both of which enabled new types of content and new types of content creators. </p><p><span>With Google, any coder in a garage could spin up a website – a new form of content – and let the world find it. With Facebook, your crazy uncle’s deranged political takes – an age-old but newly digitized form of content – appeared in the same feed as stories from </span><em>The New York Times </em><span>and pictures from your friend’s party last night. </span></p><p>With Instagram, everyone became a photographer. With TikTok, anyone could make short-form videos. </p><p>Think about YouTube – think about the vast diversity of content on the platform compared to the content that a major studio would release in theaters or on TV. </p><p><strong>Spotify, while changing music’s distribution and business model, and while incentivizing a move back towards shorter songs, didn’t fundamentally change the “atomic unit” of supply, to steal Anish’s phrase. </strong></p><p><strong>[untitled], in the mega-bull case, has the opportunity to do just that.</strong><span> </span></p><p><strong>First, once it adds AI creation tools, [untitled] changes who can make music and what they can make. </strong></p><p>A talented guitarist doesn’t have to join a band and be a bit player in the lead singer’s show. She can play guitar and fill in an orchestra, even vocalists, behind her. I can write some lyrics, sing into [untitled], and back myself up with a digital band, tell it to sound a little more like Daft Punk, a little less like ABBA, or whatever. </p><p><span>Traditional musicians – the ones releasing albums on all of the DSPs today – expand what they can make and </span><em>how much they can make</em><span>. </span></p><p><strong>So second, just like there are many more tweets than there are articles in newspapers, there will be many more songs than there are on Spotify.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Many of them will make their way to Spotify and the other DSPs, but I’d imagine many of them won’t. They might be shared on other platforms  like TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter, in group chats with a small number of friends, or custom made for that special someone in a special moment. </p><p><strong>Third, exactly what that atomic unit is changes.</strong><span> </span></p><p>It might not be the song itself, or an album, or a playlist, but a journey – all of the versions, cover arts, notes, that go into making a song. </p><p><span>This is all speculation – Dancho &amp; José haven’t said this is where the product is heading – but </span><strong>I think there’s a world in which listeners subscribe to artists and get the full stream of what they’re working on</strong><span>: the WIP tracks, the completed tracks, the notes. Maybe they can take tracks and split them, remix them, release their own. Maybe there’s some attribution that pays out the original artist when their track is split, remixed, released, and paid for. </span></p><p>“We believe creation is a higher form of consumption and expect more and more consumers to demand these types of experiences in the future,” Ethan at Shine told me. And that while consumption on streaming platforms might not increase with more creation – we only have two ears, and they only have so many hours in a day – “Our bet is that democratizing access to the creative process will increase the population of \"music creators\" (many of which never make it to DSPs) and [untitled] will be able to directly monetize the full spectrum of consumers interested in music - ranging from fans, to novice beatmakers, to superstars - through premium tools and access to musical artifacts.”</p><p><span>[untitled] is the first investment that Shine has made against its two-year-old thesis – Mo and I had our call right after I wrote this last section, so if I’m crazy, Mo’s crazy too – that </span><strong>consumer was going to make a comeback, in a different form. </strong></p><p>That it was going to be about reestablishing meaning as an important vector. “Music,” he said, “is the most fundamentally unifying creative type.” That these platforms would start out single-player – like [untitled] has – earn stickiness by providing a lot of value, and then grow out in concentric circles, growing out from the artist at the core. </p><p>The atomic unit becomes the artist, or the process, or something – the way that more people are paying for individual Substacks because they just want to read whatever that person writes. </p><p>What happens to the labels in this world? Does [untitled] replace them? </p><p>Maybe they survive, but become less relevant, the way newspaper publishers have survived, but become less relevant. They still own valuable back catalogs at the very least. But think about what a label does: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Financing:</strong><span> not as important when the cost to create and distribute trends towards $7.99 per month. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>A&amp;R:</strong><span> not as important when music becomes networked, when anyone with taste can be a scout. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Production: </strong><span>not as important when more of that happens in the app.</span><strong> </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Album creation: </strong><span>not as important if the album is no longer an atomic unit, and the fans can give their input on what the artist makes directly. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing &amp; Promotion</strong><span>: not as important, again, if it’s networked. I don’t pay someone to market and promote my newsletters or tweets. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution:</strong><span> not as important when you can distribute to DSPs at the push of a button.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Business management: not as important if software can handle payouts.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Tour support and merch:</strong><span> probably gets unbundled. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Industry connections:</strong><span> not as important when you’re going direct. </span></p></li></ol><p>I’m painting an extreme version of this future. A lot of these functions will still have value. People have been incorrectly predicting the end of labels for a long time. But I really do think a lot changes when the nature of who creates and what they create does. </p><p><span>Besides, Frank Ocean doesn’t work with a label.

You want a small niche of passionate users to tell other people in their niche that they have to try this new app. You want people to trade WIP tracks like a currency of sorts, like mix tapes back in the day. You want the thing to feel a little edgy – but polished – like being a fan of the band before they got big. </span></p><p>That trade-off – maintaining your cool as you grow and get more popular – is another one that artists have struggled with as long as there have been artists. It’s one that [untitled] will have to face, too, as they get more popular, make more money, add more power to their simple app.  </p><p>I think it’s one they’re uniquely suited to figuring out, as artists slash technologists, and not the other way around. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ea717c68-36ea-4dee-8442-95d01f22fdff?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5de5ebd3-6118-43b0-9efc-53e0e4d4ae75_908x392.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Theirs is a vision of the future I want to see exist: one in which more people are creators, in which people create, share, and remix in conversation with each other. Certainly, one in which AI doesn’t replace artists, just gives them superpowers, the kind of world people say they want in some indefinite way but that Dancho &amp; José have a definite opinion on how to bring about. </p><p>Personally, there’s this barbell of companies I want to see exist in the world. </p><p><span>On the one side are the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ac638932-80c2-4528-95e3-4a70daec8084?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vertical Integrators</a><span>, the companies building big, difficult things in the physical world to create the conditions for abundance, prosperity, and freedom, companies that help humanity live longer and richer. I write a lot about those. </span></p><p>On the other side are companies that make all of that living more fulfilling. The ones that answer the question: if we really do build machines that let us work less, what are we going to do with ourselves? </p><p>There’s a lot of work between now and that future, hours after hours spent sweating the details, getting the product just right for a small group of artists who will tell other artists who will spread the word to the world. From Elsewhere to everywhere.</p><p>The art they’re making is unfinished – it might always be unfinished – but what [untitled] is belting at the top of its lungs is that there’s a lot of value in the process. </p><p><em>Thanks to Claude for editing, and to Dancho, José, Stephen, Dorian, Al, Anish, Olivia, Adam, Mo, and Ethan for your input! </em></p><p><span>That’s all for today.

Valley that they give the region its name, and, more importantly, it’s culture: chips require huge amounts of up-front investment, but they have, relative to most other manufactured goods, minimal marginal costs; this economic reality helped drive the development of the venture capital model, which provided unencumbered startup capital to companies who could earn theoretically unlimited returns at scale. This model worked even better with software, which was perfectly replicable.</p>\n<p>That history starts in 1956, when William Shockley founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to commercialize the transistor that he had helped invent at Bell Labs; he chose Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother. A year later the so-called “Traitorous Eight”, led by William Noyce, left and founded Fairchild Semiconductor down the road. Six years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened a facility in Hong Kong to assemble and test semiconductors. Assembly required manually attaching wires to a semiconductor chip, a labor-intensive and monotonous task that was difficult to do economically with American wages, which ran about $2.50/hour; Hong Kong wages were a tenth of that. Four years later Texas Instruments opened a facility in Taiwan, where wages were $0.19/hour; two years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened another facility in Singapore, where wages were $0.11/hour.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can make the case that the classic story of Silicon Valley isn’t completely honest. Chips did have marginal costs, but that marginal cost was, within single digit years of the founding of Silicon Valley, exported to Asia.</p>\n<p>Moreover, that exportation was done with the help of the U.S. government. In 1962 the U.S. Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/87/statute/STATUTE-76/STATUTE-76-Pg72-3.pdf\">Tariff Classification Act of 1962</a>, which amended the Tariff Act of 1930 to implement new tariff schedules developed by the United States Tariff Commission; those <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/tariff_affairs/pub103.pdf\">new schedules were implemented in 1963</a>, and included Tariff Item 807.00, which read:</p>\n<p>\n  Articles assembled abroad in whole or in part of products of the United States which were exported for such purpose and which have not been advanced in value or improved in condition abroad by any means other than by the act of assembly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A duty upon the full value of the imported article, less the cost or value of such products of the United States.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The average Hong Kong worker assembled around 24 chips per hour; that meant their value add to the overall cost of the chip was just over $0.01, which means that tariffs were practically non-existent. This was by design! Chris Miller writes in <a href=\"https://www.christophermiller.net/books\">Chip War</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  South Vietnam would send shock waves across Asia. Foreign policy strategists perceived ethnic Chinese communities all over the region as ripe for Communist penetration, ready to fall to Communist influence like a cascade of dominoes. Malaysia’s ethnic Chinese minority formed the backbone of that country’s Communist Party, for example. Singapore’s restive working class was majority ethnic Chinese. Beijing was searching for allies—and probing for U.S. weakness…</p>\n<p>  By the end of the 1970s, American semiconductor firms employed tens of thousands of workers internationally, mostly in Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. A new international alliance emerged between Texan and Californian chipmakers, Asian autocrats, and the often ethnic-Chinese workers who staffed many of Asia’s semiconductor assembly facilities.</p>\n<p>  Semiconductors recast the economies and politics of America’s friends in the region. Cities that had been breeding grounds for political radicalism were transformed by diligent assembly line workers, happy to trade unemployment or subsistence farming for better paying jobs in factories. By the early 1980s, the electronics industry accounted for 7 percent of Singapore’s GNP and a quarter of its manufacturing jobs. Of electronics production, 60 percent was semiconductor devices, and much of the rest was goods that couldn’t work without semiconductors. In Hong Kong, electronics manufacturing created more jobs than any sector except textiles. In Malaysia, semiconductor production boomed in Penang, Kuala Lumpur, and Melaka, with new manufacturing jobs providing work for many of the 15 percent of Malaysian workers who had left farms and moved to cities between 1970 and 1980. Such vast migrations are often politically destabilizing, but Malaysia kept its unemployment rate low with many relatively well-paid electronics assembly jobs.\n</p>\n<p>This is a situation that, at least in theory, should not persist indefinitely; increased demand for Asian labor should push up both the cost of that labor and also the currency of the countries where that labor is in demand, making those countries less competitive over time. The former has certainly happened: Taiwan, where I live, is one of the richest countries in the world. And yet chip-making is centered here to a greater extent than ever before, in seeming defiance of theory.</p>\n<h3>The Post-War Order</h3>\n<p>The problem with theory is usually reality; in 1944 the U.S. led the way in establishing what came to be known as the Bretton Woods System, which pegged exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. This was a boon to the devastated economies of Europe and first Japan, and then later the rest of Asia: an influx of U.S. capital rebuilt their manufacturing capability by leveraging their relatively lower cost of labor. This did raise labor costs, but thanks to the currency peg, the U.S. currency couldn’t depreciate in response, which in turn made U.S. debt much more attractive than it might have been otherwise for those manufacturing profits, which in turn helped to fund both the Vietnam War and the 1960’s expansion in social programs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately this pressure on the U.S. dollar was too intense, leading to the dissolution of Bretton Woods in 1971 and a depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to gold; the overall structure of the world economy, however, was set: trade was denominated in dollars — i.e. the U.S. dollar was the world’s reserve currency — which kept its value higher than economic theory would dictate. This made U.S. debt attractive, which funded deficit spending; that spending fueled the U.S. consumer market, which bought imported manufactured goods; the profits of those goods were reinvested into U.S. debt, which helped pay for the military that kept the entire system secure.</p>\n<p>The biggest winner was the U.S. consumer. Money was cycled into the economy through an impressive and seemingly impossible array of service sector jobs and quickly spent on cheap imports. Those cheap imports were getting better too: to take chips as an example, increased automation decreased costs, and the development of software made those chips much more valuable. This applied not just to the chips directly, but everything built with and enabled by them; the actual building of electronics happened in Asia, as countries rapidly ascended the technological ladder, but the software was the province of Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>This is where it matters that software is truly a zero marginal cost product. R&amp;D costs for tech companies has skyrocketed for decades, but that increase has been more than offset by the value created by software and captured by scale. Moreover, those increasing costs manifested as the highest salaries in the world for talent, the true scarce resource in technology. This meant that the most capable technologists made their way to the U.S. generally and Silicon Valley specifically to earn the most money, and, if they had the opportunity and drive, to create new companies as <a href=\"https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\">software ate the world</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, software runs on hardware, and here Asia dominates. Consider AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chip design, a zero marginal cost activity, is done by Nvidia, a Silicon Valley company.</li>\n<li>Chip manufacturing, a minimal marginal cost activity that requires massive amounts of tacit knowledge gained through experience, is done by TSMC, a Taiwanese company.</li>\n<li>An AI system contains multiple components beyond the chip, many if not most of which are manufactured in China, or other countries in Asia.</li>\n<li>Final assembly generally happens outside of China due to U.S. export controls; Foxconn, for example, assembles many of its systems in Mexico.</li>\n<li>AI is deployed mostly by U.S. companies, and the vast majority of application development is done by tech companies and startups, primarily in Silicon Valley.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact the the U.S. is the bread in the AI sandwich is no accident: those are the parts of the value chain where marginal cost is non-existent and where the software talent has the highest leverage. Similarly, it’s no accident that the highest value add in terms of hardware happens in Asia, where expertise has been developing for fifty years. The easiest — and by extension, most low-value — aspect is assembly, which can happen anywhere labor is cheap.</p>\n<p>All of this has happened in a world where the trend in trade was towards more openness and fewer barriers, at least in terms of facilitating this cycle. One key development was the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a 1996 World Trade Organization agreement, which completely eliminated tariffs on IT products, including chips. The Internet, meanwhile, meant there were no barriers to the spread of software, with the notable exception of China’s Great Firewall; the end result is that while U.S. software ran on Asian hardware, it was U.S. companies that ultimately reaped the largest returns from scale.</p>\n<h3>Cars and China</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the defining characteristic of the Clinton-Bush-Obama era was the assumption that this system would continue forever; it certainly is plausible in terms of products. Consider cars: for a hundred years cars were marvelous mechanical devices with tens of thousands of finely engineered parts predicated on harnessing the power of combustion to transport people and products wherever they wished to go. Electrical cars, however, are something else entirely: yes, there is stilla mechanical aspect, as there must be to achieve movement in physical space, but the entire process is predicated on converting electricity to mechanical movement, and governed entirely by chips and software.</p>\n<p>This products looks a lot more like a computer on wheels than the mechanical cars we are familiar with; it follows, then, that the ultimate structure of the car industry might end up looking something like the structure of AI: the U.S. dominates the zero marginal cost components like design and the user experience, while Asia — China specifically, given the scale and labor requirements — dominantes manufacturing.</p>\n<p>This has been Waymo’s plan; while current self-driving cars on the road are retrofitted Jaguar I-Pace sedans, the 6th-generation Waymo vehicle is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23471183/waymo-zeekr-geely-autonomous-vehicle-av-robotaxi\">manufactured by Chinese car company Geely</a>. This car, called Zeekr, is purpose-built for transportation, but ideally it would be custom-built for Waymo’s purposes: you can imagine future fleets of self-driving cars with designs for different use cases, from individual taxis to groups to working offices to sleeper cars. The analogy here would be to personal computing devices: you can get a computer in rack form, a desktop, a laptop, or a phone; the chips and software are by-and-large the same.</p>\n<p>Cars aren’t there yet, but they’re not far off; the relative simplicity of electric cars make it more viable for established car manufactures to basically offer customizable platforms: that is how a company like Xiaomi can develop its own SUV. The consumer electronics company, most well-known for their smartphones, contracts with Beijing Automotive Group for manufacturing, while doing the design and technological integration. Huawei has a similar arrangement with Seres, Changan, and Chery Automobile.</p>\n<p>Tesla, it should be noted, is a bit different: the company is extremely vertically integrated, building not only its own hardware and software but also a significant number of the components that go into its cars; this isn’t a surprise, given Tesla’s pioneering role in electrical cars (pioneers are usually vertically integrated), but it does mean that Tesla faces a significant long-term threat from the more modular Chinese approach. Given this, it’s not a surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23471183/waymo-zeekr-geely-autonomous-vehicle-av-robotaxi\">Elon Musk is staking Tesla’s long-term future on autonomy</a>, in effect doubling down on the company’s integration.</p>\n<p>Regardless, what is notable — and ought to be a wake-up call to Silicon Valley — is the fact that the Xiaomi and Huawei cars run Chinese software. One of the under-appreciated benefits of the Great Firewall is that it created an attractive market for software developers that was not reachable from Silicon Valley; this means that while a good number of Chinese software engineers are in the U.S., there is a lot of talent in China as well, and that talent is being applied to products that can leverage Chinese manufacturing to win markets Silicon Valley thought would be theirs to sandwich forever.</p>\n<p>Waymo’s Zeekr car, meanwhile, has a problem; from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-12/biden-s-china-tariffs-salvo-to-range-from-doubling-to-quadruple\">Bloomberg</a> in May:</p>\n<p>\n  President Joe Biden will quadruple tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and sharply increase levies for other key industries this week, unveiling the measures at a White House event framed as a defense of American workers, people familiar with the matter said. Biden will hike or add tariffs in the targeted sectors after nearly two years of review. The total tariff on Chinese EVs will rise to 102.5% from 27.5%, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. Others will double or triple in targeted industries, though the scope remains unclear.\n</p>\n<p>Given this, it’s no surprise that Waymo had a new announcement <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2024/10/waymo-and-hyundai-enter-partnership/\">in October</a>: Waymo was partnering with Hyundai for new self-driving cars that are manufactured in America. This car is a retro-fitted IONIQ 5, which is built as a passenger car, unlike the transportation-focused Zeekr; in other words, Google is taking a step back in functionality because of government policy.</p>\n<h3>Trump’s Tariffs</h3>\n<p>Waymo may not be the only company taking a step back: newly (re-)elected President Trump’s signature economic proposal is tariffs. From the <a href=\"https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/\">2024 GOP Platform</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  Our Trade deficit in goods has grown to over $1 Trillion Dollars a year. Republicans will support baseline Tariffs on Foreign-made goods, pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, and respond to unfair Trading practices. As Tariffs on Foreign Producers go up, Taxes on American Workers, Families, and Businesses can come down.\n</p>\n<p>Foreign Policy published an explainer over the weekend entitled <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/18/trump-tariffs-china-trade-economics/\">Everything You Wanted to Know About Trump’s Tariffs But Were Afraid to Ask</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed “tariff man,” campaigned on the promise of ratcheting import duties as high as 60 percent against all goods from China, and perhaps 20 percent on everything from everywhere else. And he might be able to do it—including by drawing on little-remembered authorities from the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the previous nadir of U.S. trade policy.</p>\n<p>  Trump’s tariff plans are cheered by most of his economic advisers, who see them as a useful tool to rebalance an import-dependent U.S. economy. Most economists fear the inflationary impacts of sharply higher taxes on U.S. consumers and businesses, as well as the deliberate drag on economic growth that comes from making everything more expensive. Other countries are mostly confused, uncertain whether Trump’s tariff talk is just bluster to secure favorable trade deals for the United States, or if they’ll be more narrowly targeted or smaller than promised. Big economies, such as China and the European Union, are preparing their reprisals, just in case.</p>\n<p>  What makes it hard for economists to model and other countries to understand is that nobody, even in Trump world, seems to know exactly why tariffs are on the table.\n</p>\n<p>Sounds like the explainer needs an explainer! Or maybe the author was afraid to ask, but I digress.</p>\n<p>The story to me seems straightforward: the big loser in the post World War 2 reconfiguration I described above was the American worker; yes, we have all of those service jobs, but what we have much less of are traditional manufacturing jobs. What happened to chips in the 1960s happened to manufacturing of all kinds over the ensuing decades. Countries like China started with labor cost advantages, and, over time, moved up learning curves that the U.S. dismantled; that is how you end up with this from Walter Isaacson in his <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Steve-Jobs/Walter-Isaacson/9781982176860\">Steve Jobs biography</a> about a dinner with then-President Obama:</p>\n<p>\n  When Jobs’s turn came, he stressed the need for more trained engineers and suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the United States should be given a visa to stay in the country. Obama said that could be done only in the context of the “Dream Act,” which would allow illegal aliens who arrived as minors and finished high school to become legal residents — something that the Republicans had blocked. Jobs found this an annoying example of how politics can lead to paralysis. “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done,” he recalled. “It infuriates me.”</p>\n<p>  Jobs went on to urge that a way be found to train more American engineers. Apple had 700,000 factory workers employed in China, he said, and that was because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those workers. “You can’t find that many in America to hire,” he said. These factory engineers did not have to be PhDs or geniuses; they simply needed to have basic engineering skills for manufacturing. Tech schools, community colleges, or trade schools could train them. “If you could educate these engineers,” he said, “we could move more manufacturing plants here.” The argument made a strong impression on the president. Two or three times over the next month he told his aides, “We’ve got to find ways to train those 30,000 manufacturing engineers that Jobs told us about.”\n</p>\n<p>I think that Jobs had cause-and-effect backwards: there are not 30,000 manufacturing engineers in the U.S. because there are not 30,000 manufacturing engineering jobs to be filled. That is because the structure of the world economy — choices made starting with Bretton Wood in particular, and cemented by the removal of tariffs over time — made them nonviable. Say what you will about the viability or wisdom of Trump’s tariffs, the motivation — to undo eighty years of structural changes — is pretty straightforward!</p>\n<p>The other thing about Jobs’ answer is how ultimately self-serving it was. This is not to say it was wrong: Apple could not only not manufacture an iPhone in the U.S. because of cost, it also can’t do so because of capability; that capability is downstream of an ecosystem that has developed in Asia and a long learning curve that China has traveled and that the U.S. has abandoned. Ultimately, though, the benefit to Apple has been profound: the company has the best supply chain in the world, centered in China, that gives it the capability to build computers on an unimaginable scale with maximum quality for not that much money at all.</p>\n<p>This benefit has extended to every tech company, whether they make their own hardware or not. Software has to run on something, whether that be servers or computer or phones; hardware is software’s most essential complement. Joel Spolsky, in his canonical post about <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/\">commoditizing your complements</a>, wrote:</p>\n<p>\n  Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements…A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems. And babysitters are a complement of dinner at fine restaurants. In a small town, when the local five star restaurant has a two-for-one Valentine’s day special, the local babysitters double their rates. (Actually, the nine-year-olds get roped into early service.)…</p>\n<p>  Demand for a product increases when the price of its complements decreases. In general, a company’s strategic interest is going to be to get the price of their complements as low as possible. The lowest theoretically sustainable price would be the “commodity price” — the price that arises when you have a bunch of competitors offering indistinguishable goods…If you can run your software anywhere, that makes hardware more of a commodity. As hardware prices go down, the market expands, driving more demand for software (and leaving customers with extra money to spend on software which can now be more expensive.)…\n</p>\n<p>Spolsky’s post was written in 2002, well before the rise of smartphones and, more pertinently, ad-supported software that now permeates our world. That, though, only makes his point: hardware has become so cheap and so widespread that software can be astronomically valuable even as its free to end users. Which, by the way, is that other part of the boon to consumers I noted above.</p>\n<h3>It’s Time to Build</h3>\n<p>A mistake many analysts make, particularly Americans, is viewing the U.S. as the only agent of change in the world; events like the Ukraine or Gaza Wars are a reminder that we aren’t in control of world events, and nothing would make that lesson clearer than a Chinese move on Taiwan. At the same time, we are living in a system the U.S. built, so it’s worth thinking seriously about the implications of a President with a mandate to blow the whole thing up.</p>\n<p>The first point is perhaps the most comforting: there is a good chance that Trump makes a lot of noise and accomplishes little, at least in terms of trade and — pertinently for this blog — its impact on tech. That is arguably what happened his first term: there were China tariffs (that Apple was excluded from), and a ban on chip shipments to Huawei (that massively buoyed Apple), and TSMC committed to building N-1 fabs in Arizona. From a big picture perspective, though, today Silicon Valley is more powerful and richer than ever, and the hardware dominance of Asia generally and China specifically is larger than ever.</p>\n<p>The reality is that uprooting the current system will take years of upheaval and political and economic pain; those who argue it is impossible are wrong, but believing its highly improbable is very legitimate. Indeed, it may be the case that systems can only truly be remade in the presence of an exogenous destructive force, which is to say war.</p>\n<p>The second point, though, is that there does seem to be both more risk and opportunity than many people think. Tariffs do change things; by virtue of my location I talk to plenty of people on the ground who have been busy for years moving factories, not from China to the U.S., but to places like Thailand or Vietnam. That doesn’t really affect the trade deficit, but things that matter don’t always show up in aggregate numbers.</p>\n<p>To that end, the risk for tech is that tariffs specifically and Trump’s approach to trade generally do more damage to the golden goose than expected. More expensive hardware ultimately constricts the market for software; tariffs in violation of agreements like the ITA give the opening for other countries to impose levies of their own, and U.S. tech companies could very well be a popular target.</p>\n<p>The opportunity, meanwhile, is to build new kinds of manufacturing companies that can seize on a tariff-granted price advantage. These sorts of companies, perhaps to Trump’s frustration, are not likely to be employment powerhouses; the real opportunity is taking advantage of robotics and AI to make physical goods into zero marginal cost items in their own right (outside of commodities; this is what has happened to chips: assembly and testing are fully automated, which makes a U.S. buildout viable).</p>\n<p>To take a perhaps unintuitive example, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/amazon-earnings-robotics-and-amazons-expanding-1p-business/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L2FtYXpvbi1lYXJuaW5ncy1yb2JvdGljcy1hbmQtYW1hem9ucy1leHBhbmRpbmctMXAtYnVzaW5lc3MvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3MzQ1MzgwNjEsImlhdCI6MTczMTk0NjA2MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.UpF715MKqMQ-pAeQjH0jbyWcQllArRWGbKIM5KUjikoZbUwEu1XeiXnUy-CQc7on1lkHJuhUB6JygYHqMm_McuXMqQauRzB-7i-JBeWodwC-qX1iHWuJv_9754yEUcdpxTUEa-FdJNcfOjPkg4fEkkjC2HM2Clyze5w6N70jJe9prX10nH4w8P6L3D6E6ZJy1GUDUGjctf0FJ65VV8GKAT_Ktt87CKALfoGWeiM3J-vpo0cUVg11ReuVfMdVanfMl51PYZVupuW6wi_t37j4VIv8V9y1t5o12yjnQCgqB6K1rR7y-K8SvS4pErVG_iclTaJ6h4bBdvaad0idQSjFtQ\">consider Amazon</a>: the company is deeply investing in automation for its fulfillment centers, which decreases the marginal cost of picking, enabling the company to sell more items like “Everyday Essentials” that don’t cost much but are purchased frequently; it’s also no surprise that Amazon is invested in drones and self-driving car startups, to take the same costs out of delivery. It’s a long journey, to be sure, but it’s a destination that is increasingly possible to imagine.</p>\n<p>The analogy to manufacturing is that a combination of automation and modular platforms, defined by software, are both necessary and perhaps possible to build for the first time in a long time. It won’t be an easy road — see <a href=\"https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/strategy/articles/teslas-problem-overestimating-automation-underestimating-humans/\">Tesla’s struggles with automation</a> — but there is, at a minimum, a market in national security, and perhaps arenas like self-driving cars, to build something scalable with assumptions around modularity and software-defined functionality at the core.</p>\n<p>Again, I don’t know if this will work: the symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley software makers and Asian hardware manufactures is one of the most potent economic combinations in history, and it may be impossible to compete with; if it’s ever going to work, though, the best opportunity — absent a war, God forbid — is probably right now.</p>\n\n                                                                            \n                                                                        \n

Preorders are super important for book launches! On with the show…</span></em></p><p><span>What is the point of talking about botanical beauty or mystery in times like these? How can anyone let their eyes linger on the way the light is hitting a bowl of persimmons? Who could be thinking about flowers </span><em>at a moment like this</em><span>?</span><span>¹</span></p><p><span>Fair questions. Let me try to answer them. Fair warning: It’s going to be a bit of a roundabout journey, and it begins, as so many journeys in these times do, with Octavia Butler’s </span><em>The Parable of the Sower. </em></p><p><span>Published in 1993, the novel opens 21 years in the future—that is to say, 2024—in a degraded Los Angeles suburb. Lauren Olamina is a teenage girl from a family just up from the bottom rung of a society that is collapsing on itself. On November 6, 2024, a presidential candidate wins with the slogan, </span><em>Make America Great Again</em><span>. “He hopes to … suspend ‘overly restrictive’ minimum wage, environmental, and worker protection laws for those employers willing to take on homeless employees and provide them with training and adequate room and board,” Olamina writes in her journal. In practice, this means bringing back slavery. That president, Christopher Charles Morpeth Donner, is pretty much what you expect. </span></p><p><span>The narrator Olamina, on the other hand, is not. She has very little and soon loses even that. Her response to her circumstances is to imagine this new religion called </span><em>Earthseed</em><span>. Bits of Earthseed lore are included throughout The Parable. For times like these, the basic tenets have always felt like a balm to me (and many others). For example: </span></p><pre>All that you touch \r\nYou Change. \r\nAll that you Change \r\nChanges you. \r\nThe only lasting truth \r\nIs Change. \r\nGod Is Change.</pre><p>Once that concept got into my mind, I have thought about it pretty much every day for 10 years. </p><p>Or consider this bit of wisdom: </p><pre>Earthseed \r\nCast on new ground \r\nMust first perceive \r\nThat it knows nothing.</pre><p><span>Undoubtedly, you will see this book and Earthseed more in the coming months, as we did when Trump was first elected. There’s something so eerie and uncanny about this work. We </span><em>should</em><span> be stunned by Butler’s prescience, and scour the text for what it might offer about the cultural and political dynamics of our time. </span></p><p><span>But that’s not all that’s going on. Earthseed is not mere folk wisdom or sci-fi guide to the future. There is </span><em>a key dictum</em><span> of Earthseed that almost everyone ignores, and which names the purpose of humanity: </span></p><pre>We are all Godseed, but no more or less so than any other aspect of the universe, Godseed is all there is—all that Changes. Earthseed is all that spreads Earthlife to new earths. The universe is Godseed. Only we are Earthseed. And the Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars.</pre><p><em>The desinty of Earthseed is to take root among the stars</em><span>. </span></p><p>Olamina means this literally. In her religion, humans have a special purpose, and it is to spread our biosphere (“Earthlife”) to other planets. </p><p><span>There are fascinating passages in the book where she tries to tell people about her vision for Earthseed. They do not really believe her. Space travel? Lady, </span><em>slavery is back</em><span>! Refugees are streaming up I-5! Drugs and gangs and guns are everywhere! Society has collapsed! Space travel?!? </span></p><p>Sometimes the characters, like many people in our real world, choose to see Earthseed as mere prescription for an addled world. But Olamina is clear: “Fixing the world is not what Earthseed is about.” It is bigger than that.

In fact, it makes recruiting people to Earthseed more difficult. There is something inexplicable about it. Why did she feel this way? Because she did. It came from the part of her that did not need any kind of instrumental justification. </p><p><span>Over time, I came to understand it differently. Butler is saying: people need a transcendent goal, a way of tapping into the awe and wonder of the universe. The impossibility of travel to the stars in the Parable is neither here nor there. The power of Earthseed is that it demonstrates that </span><em>anyone</em><span> in </span><em>any circumstances</em><span> can hold an audacious and global dream for humanity in their heart. The existence of a nearly impossible vision inside Lauren Olamina is, itself, a form for power; it says, you cannot kill off the spirit through brute force and immiseration. </span></p><p><span>Does the </span><em>specific</em><span> dream matter? I’m not sure it does. And I would suggest a journey inwards into life, rather than outwards into space. </span></p><p><span>To me, our destiny is to be the part of the biosphere that comes to understand what it is to be alive. Life, in its many forms, remains fundamentally mysterious. Life does things that the rest of the universe does not. As physicist and astrobiologist Sara Imari Walker puts it, “Life is the only physics that can generate complex objects.\" Life has </span><em>agency</em><span>, and yet is made of the same things as the rest of the universe. How? It has something to do with information and energy, something down near the fundamentals of the universe, but how the parts are connected remains unclear. </span></p><p>On Sunday, I went to see Kija Lucas’s incredible show at the Palo Alto Art Center. Kija grew up in Palo Alto in an intentionally racially integrated community, with all the attendant complexities you might imagine there. Her work takes the form of incredible photographs of botanical materials (almost) glowing from within. They are, I would say, memory traces as much as objects, and they pulsate with energy. Each one calls you to see the plant in question differently, to replace your low-resolution image of it with one of Kija’s gorgeous rendered portraits. And in that quality of attention, there is a portal to thinking about the raw complexity of life, structure stacked in structure stacked in structure. </p><p><span>Out of the vast universe of things we might know about life, we don’t know much, as books like </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/42f4d882-f277-4328-a9ba-503acfee8a8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">Philip Ball’s </a><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/42f4d882-f277-4328-a9ba-503acfee8a8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">How Life Works</a></em><span> show. The idea that life is fundamentally like some kind of machine—whether steam engine or computer—has run its course. Life is always more complex than anyone bargains on. Life is always doing more than we imagined. Every time we learn a big new thing, it becomes the “secret to life,” but man, turns out, life has a lot of secrets! </span></p><p><span>Ball says, “life is what </span><em>creates</em><span> such meaning as exists in the cosmos” because life is trying to do things; it has goals and purposes. Understanding what the different forms of life around us are trying to do and playing our role in maintaining our biosphere is a task as cosmic as seeding the stars. </span></p><p>Our specific American politics is an important part of that because of the power and capital we have amassed, but it does not and should not negate our interest and investment in the more-than-human world. And like Olamina, I’m not saying this because I think it is good for you to touch grass and get the compost ready and plant bulbs in the face of reactionary politics. This isn’t (only) about fixing the world. This is about taking your role seriously as Earthseed, as part of humanity. </p><p>We’re so desperate right now for a future direction. One candidate argued for a return to American greatness; the other said we can’t go back. But who has defined a vision in recent decades for what we’re moving towards in this great big future? Hopefully, we extend our circles of care, fix core structural problems, remediate the land, and bring our role in the biosphere into balance.</p><p><span>And </span><em>also</em><span>, I hope we take on our human destiny of being the life that knows all other life — animal, vegetal, bacterial, fungal — reaching back to when life became. Our knowledge has reached back and up and in, but the project is incomplete and will be long into the future. </span></p><p>Or, as the tenets of Earthseed would have it: </p><pre>There is no end\r\nTo what a living world \r\nWill demand of you.</pre><div><span>1</span><div><p><span>Reader Haley Gonzalez tells me this brought to mind the Hanif Abdurraqib poem “</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/197edce4-c5dc-4857-9c0f-663959dfe24c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">How Can Black People Write About Flowers at a Time Like This</a><span>”</span></p></div></div></div>",

In addition, the plan calls for 35 gigawatts of new capacity within a decade. </p><p>This is one of the most ambitious plans for nuclear energy ever laid out by a U.S. president — instead of maintaining the status quo or focusing entirely on safety concerns, the plan meets bipartisan momentum for nuclear energy, which has been pulled forward by the AI boom and other geopolitical issues. Nuclear buildout has stagnated for the last 50+ years, with barely any capacity added since the 90s. This plan flips that with a goal to not only increase nuclear capacity, but triple it within 25 years. </p><p><span>The plan itself is pretty on point.

The plan calls for capacity expansion through the construction of new sites and the revival of idle plants, the deployment of small reactors, and public/private partnership to make it all happen. The plan also calls for a number of regulatory and policy changes to make this all possible: expanding the skilled-labor workforce to build and work on these sites, removing regulatory barriers to construction and operation, and tax policies to make it all economically feasible. </span></p><p>Let’s just hope DOGE doesn’t come after this specific governmental initiative…</p><p><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0733c0d2-4515-406f-b0bf-fe0afc7d55e0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Jacob Rintamaki</a></em><span> </span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong><span>The creation of </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/06d89564-4e07-4f71-a27a-a2a6d4b84d69?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">molecular nanotechnology</a><span> (highly capable molecular machines that assemble products with atomic precision) could </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f49681ad-3cde-4b12-9c5f-564e89b6bb93?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">rival</a><span> or </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/187e0240-ae83-4e7f-a03b-0859a3dd3174?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">surpass</a><span> the impact of the Industrial Revolution. </span></strong></em></p><p><em><span>Our physical production capacity could be increased by many orders of magnitude while making our current computers, medicines, and machines look primitive by comparison.

And it’s now available for academic use.</p><p><span>This is one of the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/998fcbab-721d-4b58-9624-58bb0660bf29?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">positives of monopolies</a><span>: Google has likely spent tens of billions of dollars building AlphaFold 3 and because it’s not directly crucial to its core monopoly business of search, it feels comfortable enough open sourcing it. The move will certainly accelerate scientific research and drug discovery. But it’s not entirely altruistic: the move bolster’s Google’s role as a leader in AI, builds goodwill with researchers, and ultimately should attract more top talent, plus the open sourcing is not without its limitations, as its only available for academic use and Google still protects its use in commercial applications. </span></p><p><em>Smith et al in Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe.

If you’re anything like me, your average grocery store tomato isn’t doing it for you — it’s watery and bland. This new methodology could restore the sweetness of tomatoes, without sacrificing size constraints or negatively impacting farming yields. </p><p>Of course, tomato sweetness is really just the start. It’s not a huge leap to imagine this technology being used to increase the flavor profile of a number of other fruits and vegetables, and importantly, doing so in a way that doesn’t negatively impact farming productivity or economics. Genetic modification of foods has gotten a bad wrap over the years — in reality, it’s a bit more nuanced: being able to mass produce safe, tasty food has come with tradeoffs. But this type of CRISP gene medication is generally viewed as better. It offers precise, natural-like genetic modifications without introducing foreign DNA, reducing unintended effects and improving safety and efficiency as compared to traditional GMOs.</p><p><strong>Bonus 2:</strong><span> </span><strong>I tried to melt down a real-life nuclear reactor</strong></p><p><em>Christian Keil for First Principles</em></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9a254c77-57f5-4c23-a22c-625e58804e39?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/MXOxv_nKUQM\"></a><p>Friend of Not Boring Christian Keil takes his show, First Principles, to Austin to pull the control rod out of a nuclear reactor and see what happens.

What a time to be alive. </p><p><span>Writing about politics is kind of a lose-lose. No matter what I write, a bunch of people will hate it. When I wrote </span><span>Democrats got mad at me for even considering Trump, and Republicans got mad at me for believing there was anything redeemable in the Democratic Party. </span></p><p>The truth is, though, there is nothing happening right now that impacts the types of companies I write about and invest in — Vertical Integrators and crypto, which LPs thought was an insane combination when I raised Fund III — than what’s happening in politics now. </p><p>Among the biggest risks to any of these companies is that government regulation (or regulation by enforcement) will dramatically slow them down or even stop them dead in their tracks. I believe that these companies are the highest-leverage way to improve the human condition, so to me, there’s almost nothing more important than making sure they’re free to try to succeed, and politics is a big part of that. </p><p>As I’ve been watching American politics play out live for the past week, though, I noticed that there’s a lot more in common between the current moment and the types of things that I normally write about here, and even more reason to be optimistic than I expected. </p><p>That’s the Not Boring mission: to make the world more optimistic. In other words, Make America Optimistic Again. </p><p>I just ask that you read with an open mind. </p><p>Let’s get to it. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e2eaf225-b046-4438-ac66-8db9fec5e5b8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F520feff9-9991-45fa-af81-8c96c5b34557_1200x600.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>My hunch is that we’re in the beginning of the mother of all bubbles, a bubble machine, the bubble that spawns a thousand bubbles: </span><strong>the Trump Bubble</strong><span>. </span></p><p>One of the most shocking things about last week’s Presidential election is just how excited so many people seem to be that Donald Trump won. </p><p>Not everyone is, of course. Some people think this is the end of democracy. But some other people are ecstatic. They believe this election changes everything. And a small group of people getting incredibly excited about a specific vision of the future is exactly how bubbles form. </p><p><span>Over the weekend, I read </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4d4f7a4f-e71f-4161-9f60-4831ab25870f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Byrne Hobart</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/209f1375-e1c5-4733-ab12-fa0a5f8ac664?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Tobias Huber</a><span>’s new book, </span><span>It’s really excellent, and I recommend that you </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4e4e8ff3-f6b0-4384-83f7-1861597676f7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">buy and read it with haste</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>The core argument of the book is that a certain kind of bubble can be incredibly useful in pulling the world forward. </span><strong>Bubbles, they suggest, are the cure for stagnation. </strong></p><p>Watching the reactions to the election while reading the book, I was struck by how closely the current moment matched the productive bubbles covered in the book: The Manhattan Project, The Apollo Program, Moore’s Law, The Golden Age of Corporate R&amp;D, Fracking, and Bitcoin. </p><p>Byrne and Tobias identified “five overarching traits shared by all of the technologies and megaprojects” that they studied: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Definite optimism and constrained vision</strong><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fear of Missing out (FOMO) and you only live once (YOLO) dynamics.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Excessive risk-taking and over-investment.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Parallelization and coordination.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reflexivity and hyperstition.</strong></p></li></ol><p>I see many of these on my twitter feed.

After all, both Trump and bubbles get a bad rap, both at least partially deserved. </p><p><span>When you hear the word “bubble,” you might think, “Overinflated thing that is bound to pop.” The word has negative connotations, earned in particular by the bad bubbles. But those aren’t the only bubbles. In </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b3db26a4-ee52-448f-a3f3-d5c1d0e9c5a9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Boom</a><span>, </span></em><span>Byrne and Tobias distinguish between the two kinds:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Mean-reversion bubble</strong><span>:  “the basic bet is that the future will continue along present trends.” Think: the mortgage crisis. If you bet that the future will look mostly the same, you can take on debt to lever up your bet. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Inflection bubble: “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past.” Think: the dot-com bubble. If you think that the future will look meaningfully different, you buy equity in the things you think will benefit most from the difference. </strong></p></li></ol><p><span>Inflection bubbles, they argue, drive progress. Their argument is similar to the one I made in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/245214d1-bfb4-47da-9f73-a2deddecca1a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Infinity Missions</a></em><span>: bubbles attract resources to important projects that would not make sense to fund or work on under a normal cost-benefit analysis. </span></p><p>Take the Apollo Program: </p><blockquote><p><em>When President John F.

The Trump Administration is telling people that it will be easier to build, invest in, and accomplish big things, which is already making people more excited to build, invest in, and accomplish big things.

In the last section, I wrote about Elon Musk’s process for fixing the machines that build the machines. Even I thought it was too on the nose.

Elon is the best person you could get for the job, and he took the job. </p><p>While many people have pointed out that DOGE has no real authority, that it can only make recommendations, that kind of misses the point. </p><p><span>The point is that people on both sides of the aisle believe that the government might actually become more efficient.

That’s right, we’ve got a banker and a restructuring advisor here — from the same shop! Portage Point has been establishing itself as a bigger presence in the restructuring space over the past year+ — particularly in the middle market — and that’s, in large part, attributable to these guys. Let’s dive in ⬇️.</span></p><p><strong>PETITION: Welcome guys and thanks for appearing. Before we dive in, just curious: how did you both end up in restructuring? And Jason, how does one go from practicing law for nearly a decade to banking? There are others in RX who’ve done that but it’s a pretty small club so we’re sure some of our student and junior lawyer readers would be interested to know ….</strong></p><p><strong>Tom</strong><span>: </span><em>After starting my career in public accounting, I got into restructuring right out of business school. I had taken a great class (Turnaround Management by Professor James Shein at Kellogg) that really sparked the interest, and the more I learned about the profession the more interested I became. The ability to work across finance and operations to help companies address critical issues was the initial draw, but over the years it has been the dynamic of consensus building that has been the most rewarding. Developing a great solution to an issue at hand is important, but the ultimate outcome can often belong to the team most adept at convincing others that their solution is best.</em></p><p><strong>Jason: </strong><em>I was initially drawn to restructuring in law school. I was quite certain I wanted ‘business law’, but once I took bankruptcy &amp; reorganization classes I got the restructuring ‘bug’. I was drawn to the tactical nature of drawing up and assessing a strategy and then interacting and negotiating with multiple stakeholders to implement it. I liked that there was essentially a beginning and end and you ‘sort of’ knew where you wanted to land — of course, dependent on which stakeholder you are representing.</em></p><p><em>On the move from law to banking, there are more of us hidden in the shadows than you might appreciate.</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7e568042-0ca8-4b88-9c50-0051bc918f06?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_320,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34a9656b-0c26-42e5-a3b9-e4c193d10cf7_245x217.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>But yes, it can be done (although I still pay my bar dues 17 years after leaving the law just in case … ). Lucky for me the restructuring banker that first hired me set out to hire an ex-restructuring lawyer as a banker. As for the transition from restructuring lawyer to banker, I honestly used my knowledge of bankruptcy law as a crutch for the first several years — it was my comfort zone. You do, however, learn to appreciate there is a substantial overlap in the advice provided to a common client by a good team of restructuring lawyers, bankers and advisors, with certain obvious differences. As the banker, you eventually need to become more comfortable providing ‘banker’ advice around valuation, sale processes and math stuff. </em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/55d75bfc-8d51-4a3a-845d-e62d0a65d856?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_470,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff526ac8c-fb2f-49e0-939b-77d1096f5481_470x200.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>That comfort level comes with deal repetition … and many sleepless nights.  </em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Our boy Jerome POW-ell and his brethren at the Fed finally commenced easing rates. Given how you play in the middle market, how has the easing affected your clients? Does 50bps move the needle? If not, what level of rate reduction does and why? </strong></p><p><strong>Jason</strong><span>: </span><em>For middle market companies undergoing some level of stress or distress, increased interest rates are usually only one of many factors contributing to their challenges. Even a significant reduction in interest rates, while helpful, is unlikely to solve all that ails a troubled middle market company. Amongst many other challenges, these companies struggle to increase prices (e.g. push cost of goods increases and wage inflation on to their customers) thereby having to absorb them with margin. And the margin of error for these companies is much smaller than large cap companies, with even one foot fault potentially having a cascading effect. Unfortunately, several of these companies also lack management teams with experience proactively addressing these challenges.  We have seen way too many situations this year where the company has called and simply said they are not sure if they can make the next payroll. Unfortunately, these companies are reacting to numerous dynamic variables, leaving little time for optionality. For these reasons, among others, we expect continued activity in the middle market regardless of cycles.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: There’s growing concern in the market about the potential impact of private credit due to, among other things, lack of regulation, lack of ratings on loans, and pure size. The space is HUGE and growing: there’s lots of dry powder out there. You guys work on a lot of deals with private credit bros at the top of the cap stack. What complexities do private credit providers bring to the restructuring context? In what ways do they make things easier? </strong></p><p><strong>Jason</strong><span>: </span><em>Our deals are almost exclusively situations with private credit providers in the cap stack. Private credit providers can often be more flexible in restructurings, as they are both able to take recovery in a non-debt instrument, which could include owning a substantial amount of equity, and contribute new capital to the solution. This has driven a new, interesting dynamic where many private credit funds who do not have internal operations teams are ‘taking the keys’ and must close knowledge gaps expeditiously to operate a business.</em></p><p><strong><span>PETITION: What do you make of the recent trend where private credit guys are exercising proxy rights and reconstituting the board (e.g., </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/421230d8-072b-4b11-be4b-4383bd6682fc?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Red Lobster</a><span>)? Is that something you’re hearing a lot about? Are there any other stagnant lender protections that companies and their sponsors ought to be thinking about? Is this a form of middle market lender on sponsor violence, 😜? </span></strong></p><p><strong>Jason</strong><span>: </span><em>We have been seeing (and hearing about) it more often than in the past. Historically, lenders were quite reluctant to take any action that could be interpreted as exercising ‘control’ over the borrower. With the proliferation of private credit funds in the capital structure, these funds have demonstrated a willingness to exercise proxy rights and reconstitute the board. However, in talking with several private credit funds recently, they have indicated that while they may be willing to take these actions, they are not actions taken without significant deliberation. In fact, often the appointment of an independent director can conciliate lenders in this situation — although the extent of the authority granted to that director is a key consideration. Those with actual decision-making authority are certainly favored over those who only have the right to make recommendations. </em></p><p><em>While lenders sometimes want a sponsor or company to act, they also have concerns about actions they view as detrimental to them. For example, not all bankruptcy cases are created equal and the relative cost of certain bankruptcy filings for middle market companies can be viewed as value destructive by lenders. Against that fact pattern, lenders want to ensure they have an independent director as a gatekeeper to a filing versus just recommendation rights. There is also a nuance to keep in mind as it relates to a sort of symbiotic relationship between sponsors and private credit funds — both parties often want to make sure they do not damage their relationship with each other, as they typically have lending relationships with the broader sponsor portfolio and are a likely source of deal flow and financing for these deals in the future.</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/96886200-4071-48be-95c6-1697bb1043f1?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_365,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F257dd74c-4aa0-4b65-82d1-1fbf67c248f3_555x555.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>PETITION: Jason, tell us about the kind of financings that you’re seeing in the market these days. It just seems like it’s pretty easy to get a deal cut with all of the money swirling around the system. Is that right? What kind of new money opportunities are there out there for deep-pocketed investors? Are there any terms you’re seeing that surprise you (including with DIP loans)? </strong></p><p><strong>Jason</strong><span>: </span><em>We are seeing a lot of financing activity in the current market environment even though LBO volume is a bit soft. It includes a good mix of healthy situations related to add-on acquisition financing, opportunistic refinancings to lower interest cost, dividend recapitalizations and growth/development capital.  Also, we are seeing a fair number of stressed/distressed financings to address maturities, covenant breaches and liquidity challenges. While you are right there is a significant amount of dry powder seeking to be deployed into private credit and special situations opportunities, we have found the deal teams on private credit platforms are stretched from a bandwidth perspective and therefore selective as to where they allocate resources and what deals they pursue. With respect to deal terms, spreads and up-front fees have continued to tighten, delayed draw facilities are back en vogue and dividend recap volume remains at record levels. It is certainly an issuers’ market. </em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Tom - you’re kind of an OG when it comes to solar restructuring, having participated in the Terraform BK many moons ago.

As with any industry that undergoes rapid growth, there are bound to be a lot of winners and losers along the way. Combine that level of growth with complicated industry dynamics that include rapidly evolving technical advancements, regulatory elements, energy market volatility and geopolitical risk, and it is a safe bet there will continue to be restructuring activity in that industry going forward. Specifically, the Trump administration is likely to create additional headwinds for the industry through the potential reduction or elimination of tax incentives, increased support of fossil fuels (drill baby drill!) and potential tariffs on imported solar panels.</em></p><p><em>Specifically in the residential solar space (which has been at the core of a lot of the restructuring activity), there was such a focus on growth and customer acquisition that profitability and cash flow generation were largely ignored. These companies were able to maintain sufficient liquidity by raising capital through securitizations, corporate debt, tax equity funds and preferred and common equity. As the industry matured and growth moderated, new capital has been harder to obtain which has been forcing sponsors and lenders to the table. </em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Aside from solar, what industries are you guys most focused on these days? Please provide specifics as to why. </strong></p><p><strong>Jason</strong><span>: </span><em>Right now, we are most focused on the TMT and business/industrial services industries.

You’ve also been involved recently in an agriculture bankruptcy, AppHarvest. What an in-court sh*t show that was — to be clear, not because of you or your firm, just because. Why have there been so many of these cutting edge agtech bankruptcies? Do you expect them to continue? Were these companies a function of a frothy venture capital environment? </strong></p><p><strong>Tom</strong><span>: </span><em>Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) or other agtech companies are relatively new to the US and have experienced a significant influx of capital within the past five to 10 years. In a tale as old as time, investors were sold on high valuations primarily driven by innovative technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robotics, growing configurations/equipment, etc.). This flood of capital combined with a focus on hyper-growth led to a system that largely ignored profitability. It turns out that the end consumers do not materially differentiate CEA produce from field-grown, which leads to grocers paying a similar price per pound for both. However, given the capital investments required for CEA, the cost per pound can be significantly higher. When raising fresh capital is both cheap and easy, the traditional concerns investors have are limited (or thrown out the window). However, raising new capital at historical valuations while a company is experiencing significant losses has proven incredibly challenging in the current environment. </em></p><p><em>Future agtech bankruptcies will be driven by the existing investors’ appetite (pun intended) for, and their strategic approach to, distressed assets. However, there is no question there is a need for significant operational restructurings to align direct and indirect cost structures with top-line revenue profiles. The technology aspect, while promising, continues to be unproven and costly, often distracting management teams from core fundamentals. Given the current and expected levels of distress, the industry is ripe (sorry, we couldn’t help ourselves) for consolidation led by the outperformers who can effectively get ahead of the restructuring curve.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: On the topic of hairy bankruptcies, Tom, you were also involved in Benitago, the e-commerce aggregator, as CRO. We wrote a good deal about e-commerce aggregators and lately, there’s been a ton of consolidation in the space, largely out of court after Thrasio’s filing. That segment was promoted as the future of retail and attracted billions from putatively smart people, most of which evaporated. What happened to that space? What happened in that case, specifically? It was a messy one that teetered from day one but you were able to successfully navigate it through….</strong></p><p><strong>Tom</strong><span>: </span><em><span>The </span><strong>concept</strong><span> of an e-commerce aggregator is relatively straightforward. Identify and acquire performing brands from founders and achieve scale that will create operational efficiencies that lead to increased profitability. The </span><strong>execution </strong><span>… not so much. </span></em></p><p><em>To begin with, the hype and capital directed at the segment in the years following COVID led to intense competition to acquire brands, which in turn led to very high acquisition multiples. However, as e-commerce levels have since moderated, supporting those valuations and leverage levels has proven to be very difficult. Second, consolidating multiple brands onto a single platform requires robust systems and processes which many of the aggregators did not have or were still in the process of developing. This lack of systems and processes often made it very challenging to understand the true financial and operational brand level performance. Finally, many of the brands acquired were built by founders who lived and breathed their brand 24/7. They understood everything about their brand and were deeply committed to its success. Upon acquisition, these founders cashed out and often had little role in the brand going forward. Economies of scale can obviously have tremendous benefits, but it is very challenging to replicate the level of passion and dedication that these founders had for their brands.</em></p><p><em>As for Benitago, the company was an e-commerce brand incubator and aggregator focused on creating and acquiring brands that sold through Amazon. Founded in 2016, the company originally developed five in-house brands, and (not unexpectedly) experienced explosive growth during the pandemic. </em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/648417c9-f0e0-4695-bfab-80e26e9b3292?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_320,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecbea3f7-fa4e-4b66-af41-ca1ac2bab514_292x200.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Buoyed by this success, the company then pursued an acquisition strategy to scale its platform, purchasing 12 additional brands, and funded the acquisitions through a $95mm secured financing. Fast forward to the beginning of ‘22, consumer purchasing behavior shifted to pre-pandemic levels. </em></p><p><em>Aside from the macro issues the company faced, Benitago’s capital structure complicated the restructuring discussions. Specifically, the $95mm of secured financing was composed of two separate facilities with two separate lenders that each had separate collateral packages. That alone is not terribly novel or problematic, but the complications stem from the fact that while there was not collateral overlap from a pure asset perspective, there was overlap from a ‘how do you actually operate the business’ perspective (i.e., for a given brand, one collateral package had the working capital and the other collateral package had the IP associated with the brand). This dynamic made it very difficult to arrive at anything other than a comprehensive solution.</em></p><p><em>Although the Benitago debtors were able to manage the case without a DIP, there was a desperate need for additional capital to fund the go-forward operations. Through the successful efforts of all stakeholders, we were able to quickly reach a consensual Plan of Reorganization which preserved go-forward operations through one of the secured lenders taking majority ownership of the reorganized company via equitization of its secured debt. As you noted, it was a bit of a tightrope throughout, but we were collectively able to get the situation to a good result, all things considered. </em></p><p><strong>PETITION: You’ve both been through multiple business cycles and worked with multiple industries. Is there a common theme or set of themes that bind the failures together?</strong></p><p><strong>Tom</strong><span>: </span><em>At the end of the day, our industry is the result of either poor management, bad industry dynamics or bad balance sheets. Those broad themes will stand the test of time. </em></p><p><em>Poor management is self-explanatory, but it is worth noting that this dynamic can be more prevalent in the middle market as management teams are often less experienced and systems, processes and reporting are often less sophisticated.  Bad industry dynamics and bad balance sheets typically result from shifting landscapes and a failure to adapt strategy. </em></p><p><em>One common theme relates to technology. Technological innovation and advancements are happening all the time. The companies that are slow to adapt to technological change, overinvest in technology with poor ROI or adopt the wrong (i.e., losing) technology often find their way into restructuring. </em></p><p><em>Another common theme would be 'irrational exuberance' that creates asset bubbles. The tech bubble and the subprime/real estate bubble both preceded recessions and a restructuring cycle. It is hard not to look around and not see asset bubbles all over the place, but perhaps that is just hope talking!</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/eac907e4-b450-40ce-bba8-38c8266cb709?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_358,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a1f8133-1982-460d-b18e-e6ca20a850ce_358x200.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>PETITION: We’ve seen you guys get involved in deals where you serve as both financial advisor and investment banker to a chapter 11 debtor.

And unfortunately, not the type where a company expects to have liquidity problems next quarter, but the type where management/sponsors say they do not know if the company will be able make payroll the following week. We have been dropped into that situation all too often this year. The corollary theme to a lack of liquidity has been the lack of proactive planning. Middle market companies, which are often founder or sponsor owned, often choose to run the clock out rather than proactively plan. In doing so, optionality (and often value) is severely diminished by the time advisors show up on the scene. Lastly, and effectively driven by the first two factors, getting these deals completed has been anything but smooth. The advisors have frequently had to pull stakeholders across the finish line to get a company-saving transaction closed. Feels like the risk of liquidation has been more real than I can ever recall.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Macro or otherwise, who is your biggest winner of the year?</strong></p><p><strong>Tom</strong><span>: </span><em>Private credit (see above).

This was the most fascinating election of my lifetime.</p><p><span>Back in November 2022, I wrote a piece called </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/206fe588-d24f-4aa7-bcff-79f0b3b55913?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Decentralization</a></em><span>, arguing that: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>We’re heading towards an era of greater decentralization on all fronts – geopolitics, finance, education, journalism, and energy are just a few examples – driven by technologies including, but not limited to, the internet. This newly decentralized era will require new infrastructure and organizing principles that can adapt to the chaos and complexity inherent in decentralized systems.</em></p></blockquote><p>This election was a perfect example of what I meant. </p><p>There were two new, defining things this cycle that weren’t there the last time:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Going Direct</strong><span>. The Trump campaign’s strategy involved speaking directly to the people, often through long podcasts, as opposed to letting the media define their message. I think </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8be21fb0-ff23-4553-bfc8-93a78d0ce9ae?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Jared Kushner’s appearance on Lex Fridman was a turning point</a><span>, and Elon Musk buying X and letting people say whatever they want was a key factor. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Prediction Markets.</strong><span> Platforms like </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/27ee58ef-ab34-4501-979b-9254d831c5b3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Polymarket</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5589543f-8b05-43a8-812f-b8c19eed7906?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Kalshi</a><span> let people put their money behind their predictions, and outperformed traditional polls or media prognostications. Look at that meme! Polymarket nailed it two weeks out!</span></p></li></ol><p>These two things are more related than they seem.  </p><p>Going direct creates a more chaotic information environment. Anyone can get out there and tweet, write, or podcast a firehose of information at people, and people can choose to read or listen to whatever they want. There is no Dan Rather figure to package all of that information into a clean opinion. </p><p><span>It is messy — a lot of what people tweet and say is outright bullshit and downright wrong — but makes it more likely that the truth will surface </span><em>given the right tools</em><span>. </span></p><p>Prediction markets are those right tools. Anyone can take in whatever information they think is highest-signal, even commission information like the French Whale did with neighbor polls, and put their money behind their belief. </p><p><strong>We are shooting a firehose of information at each other, and the market is essentially paying people to pull signal from the noise, in a totally decentralized manner.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Prediction markets are part of the “new infrastructure … that can adapt to the chaos and complexity inherent in decentralized systems.” </p><p><span>Maybe more than anything, this election was a repudiation of the idea that a small group of chosen people — no matter how smart — know better than the market. This is </span><strong>Joy’s Law: “No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.”</strong></p><p>Prediction markets can bring us closer to truth by incentivizing “most of the smartest people” to work on behalf of finding it, even if they’re not an American political scientist but an anonymous French ex-trader. </p><p>While politics were the first really big use case for prediction markets in the US, I expect that with greater liquidity on the platforms, we’ll see more accurate predictions for all sorts of things. If “All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge,” this is a good step towards eradicating it. </p><p><strong>(2) Introducing: Ulysses</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Our mission is to build technology for ocean stewardship and help usher in an age of abundance.</em></p></blockquote><div><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3bdc0e73-7250-471b-b030-1da3aa019330?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,h_1100,c_pad,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/l_play_button_usfui2,w_144,e_colorize:0/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F151321112%2F6d0aa8cf-1b88-4171-9bf5-9083e0671f15%2Ftranscoded-00001.png\"></a></div><p><span>Yesterday, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/60658422-56f4-477f-9838-c1d5d2371e72?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Ulysses</a><span> came out of stealth and unveiled its plans to build underwater autonomous drones that they’ll use to restore sea grass (35x better at carbon capture than rainforests) … to start.

Treating the mice with drugs that blocked CGRP-RAMP1 signaling led to reduced pain and lesion size.</em></p></blockquote><p>Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, inflammation, and sometimes infertility. It impacts about 10% of women of reproductive age in the U.S. or about 6.5 million people. It’s not only painful but is particularly scary as it can infertility. Frankly, if you’re a brute like me it’s not likely a condition you think about a lot, until it impacts someone you love, but it’s actually quite widespread.</p><p>Now, new research explored the role of neuroimmune communication in endometriosis, focusing on the calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor, RAMP1. The study shows that CGRP contributes to pain and lesion growth by altering macrophages into a pro-endometriosis phenotype.

Bipolar disorder involves mood swings between mania (highs) and depression (lows), while depression is characterized by persistent low mood without manic episodes…the difference between the two may be observable in our genes. The EDIT-B test identifies differences in RNA editing—cellular processes that regulate gene expression—using specific biomarker patterns and an AI algorithm to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression with high accuracy. It analyzes these unique RNA editing signatures in a blood sample to classify patients.</p><p>This was surprising to me: it currently takes 7-10 years to accurately diagnose bipolar disorder. Diagnosing bipolar disorder takes particularly long because its symptoms overlap with other conditions and require observing mood swings over time. The EDIT-B test drastically reduces that diagnosis window — it doesn’t rely on observing behavior and mood swings over long periods of time, it relies on accurately reading biomarkers in your blood.</p><p>But the test is not without criticism, with skeptics pointing out lack of verification of the tests results, small sample sizes, and the potential influence of medications on the biomarkers it reads. Ultimately, France and Italy have adopted the tests in recent years signaling that the potential benefits of bipolar disorder early diagnosis outweigh their concerns with the testing methodology.</p><p><em>Gracner et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We found that early-life rationing reduced diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35% and 20%, respectively, and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4e57590c-f856-4220-8c27-b88bb26c33de?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1280,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44ff97cb-24ba-4328-ae4c-4e377dbc6cf4_640x461.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>The results of this study should come as a surprise to…absolutely no one. The study, leveraging post-WWII UK sugar rationing data, found that children conceived and born during rationing had a 35% lower risk of diabetes and a 20% lower risk of high blood pressure later in life. The study analyzed 60,000 individuals and found the strongest benefits among those exposed to sugar rationing both in utero and during early childhood — meaning the earlier you can stay off the sweet stuff, the better.</p><p>The study supports the idea that early nutrition has a lasting impact, even later into life. It’s not quite clear whether this impact is due to epigenitic changes — does consuming more sugar at younger ages alter your gene activity — or consumption behavior — does consuming more sugar at younger ages build a sugar habit that’s tough to kick — or some combination of the two. But either way, it’s quite clear that inappropriate sugar consumption, really at any age, can have a deleterious impact on your health. </p><p>RFK, Jr. is wrong about a lot of things, but I do certainly think he’s onto something with his criticisms of modern food systems.

This one from me, Dan.</p><p>Identify politics did not work as expected in the 2024 Presidential Election. This time around, that turned out to be a particularly positive trend for the Republicans, but I think the overall shift away from identity politics will benefit both parties, and the American people, going forward. </p><p>The idea of the two party system has always confounded me. Because I believe X thing to by true, I therefore must also support Y and Z thing, which has nothing to do with X. Identity politics takes it one step further: because you were born into a certain racial group, you are expected to adopt X belief in the first place, which then comes along with needing to support Y and Z. It’s downright patronizing. And I don’t think it holds up in the dynamics that Packy described above: with access to more information, a voter is less likely to just blindly follow the party line.</p><p>Hispanic men in the U.S, for example, are often portrayed as a unified voting bloc yet their political preferences vary widely based on factors like age, socioeconomic status, and and country of origin. A Cuban-American in Florida has very different political motivations than a Mexican-American in California, but they’ve been treated as the same, particularly by the Democrats who could, until recently, rely on consistent voting trends from the overall bloc. A Cuban-American man doesn’t necessarily align with Democrats on immigration policy, let alone economic and social issue, but has been grouped into this larger Hispanic male bloc that is supposed to vote Democrat. </p><p>This is not only a political miscalculation, but I think points towards a deeper issue on the American left today. The left has gotten away from individualism. This manifests in a bunch of dangerous ways: group think, patronizing policies, and, yes, wokeness. If 2024 taught us anything, it’s that expecting people to think in a certain way — and then holding them to task when they don’t — leads to backlash. People have too much information today to fall for it.</p><p>Going forward, I hope the left learns from 2024 and weans off its dependence on identity politics. Not only do they need to, if they ever want to win a national election again, but because I think the groups they aim to identify with will be better off for it. </p><p><em>Jamie Carter for Forbes h/t Ian Bremmer and Tim Urban</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/13b32968-4c68-4773-a865-46cff0642909?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1918,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facd56409-3f0f-46b9-baeb-ff11cd493249_959x460.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p><span>NASA’s Juno Spacecraft just sent back new images of Jupiter and they’re stunning.

Chapter 11 is always the last alternative, that kind of a full-scale restructuring is the last alternative. Today, there is aggressive money. There’s risk-oriented money. There’s a lot of capital that will find a way to play in a capitalization and extend maturity. There’s also — again, the liability management exercises we do now are pretty sophisticated. The large institutions are willing to participate and do the analysis. If the company has a valid business usually provide runway.”</em></p><p><em>“So I think that will be the dominant part of what we call restructuring. I think it’s going to be gradual and continuous, because the size of the credit market just has gotten so much bigger over the last seven or eight years, and it’s — you can almost do a regression and the amount of restructuring, reliability management you have is a direct correlative event to how much issuance happened somewhere between two to four years before the event.

Other places around the globe cherish Fridays more than we do here in the US: </span></p><pre><code><code>“For the 52 weeks ending on December 25, 2023, the Company generated global restaurant sales of $1.4 billion. In the same time, the Company generated $62 million in revenue from its asset-light operations in the U.S. and internationally.” </code></code></pre><p>We kid, we kid: this is obviously a function of scale. </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Post-pandemic Operations</strong><span>. The debtors shifted their business considerably in response to the COVID-19 experience. Off-premises sales went from 8% to 25% as the debtors diversified their business towards online and mobile ordering, pick-up, and white-label delivery. The debtors have also been putting franchisees out of their misery, snapping up underperforming or retiring franchisees and, in many cases, closing or assigning them to others. Supply chain issues and inflation also both bit into performance. </span></p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Gift Cards</strong><span>. This company has … wait for it … nearly $50mm(!) in outstanding customer gift card obligations out there because the cards NEVER expire. Franchisees are concerned that they’re going to be left holding the bag if there’s a rush to restaurants in coming weeks to spend those cards. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/853b0645-cc68-4cc7-9d09-01c154e829f1?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Per </a><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/853b0645-cc68-4cc7-9d09-01c154e829f1?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Reuters</a></strong><span>:</span></p><pre><code><code>\"After hearing the franchisees' concerns at a Monday court hearing in Dallas, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan allowed TGI Fridays to continue its gift card program on an interim basis. The decision allows more time for franchisees to review the gift card program and TGI Fridays' finances before the program is approved for the remainder of the bankruptcy.\"</code></code></pre><p><strong>📍The Franchise Agreements</strong><span>. How much will a TGIF franchise run you in the US? It’s a $50k initial fee followed by a monthly royalty fee of 4% of gross sales plus “</span><em>a percentage of … net sales to fund marketing and advertising campaigns.</em><span>” </span></p><p>That 4% sounds rough in an inflationary environment. </p><p>As is the mandatory ten year term (with options to renew for two successive five year terms, subject to various terms and conditions). </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Securitizations</strong><span>. In ‘17, TGI Friday’s Inc. and </span><strong>Citibank NA ($C)</strong><span> entered into a base indenture and management agreement governing a securitization transaction, which included the issuance of two series of notes collateralized by, among other things, the company’s existing and future franchise agreements and existing and future intellectual property. TGI Friday’s Inc. was the manager under the agreements. The securitization entities, including </span><strong>TGI Fridays Franchisor LLC</strong><span>, sacked TGI Friday’s Inc. as manager in early September, due to, among other things, reporting failures. </span><strong>FTI Consulting Inc. ($FCN)</strong><span> has been the back-up manager since.** The company and the securitization entities are now operating pursuant to a transition services agreement which has a number of extensions built in to it which could take it through the end of Q1’25. This termination, however, was impactful. Per the debtors, “</span><em>As a result of the termination of TGI Friday’s Inc. as Manager, the Company lost a significant portion of its revenue stream as the Company would no longer receive the benefit of the restaurant royalty payments.</em><span>” </span></p><p>There’s more. The debtors may actually owe up to $30mm to the securitization entities on account of nonpayment of royalties related to both the franchise agreements and IP licenses. This would make the securitization entities the largest unsecured creditors in the cases. </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Pre-petition Cap Stack</strong><span>. Compounding the lingering effects of the pandemic and the sacking of TGI Friday’s Inc. as manager under the franchise agreements is a dangerous mix of floating rate debt plus insanely high-rate fixed debt. See ⬇️. But much of it, once you get below the </span><strong>Texas Partners Bank (d/b/a The Bank of San Antonio, “BofSA”)</strong><span> component, involves equity sponsor </span><strong>Mr. Anil Yadav</strong><span>, a businessman known in the franchisee space.* </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9477b448-12b6-4571-b5ea-7a743e707aba?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_527,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F734f5ef6-19cf-419f-a1eb-3688cc0e4f82_527x579.png\"></a></figure></div><p>The Yadav Kids Note, the Table Turn Note, and the Freebird Note are all subordinated in right of payment to the BofSA loan. </p><p>The debtors cite approximately $51.8mm due to trade creditors, exclusive of employee obligations and customer programs. The top 50 largest general unsecured creditors include a good mix of digital marketing companies and landlords but very few vendors (since many went COD pre-petition).  </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Financing</strong><span>. The debtors have a commitment from Texas Partners Bank for a $23.9mm 10%-interest DIP, comprised of $5.9mm in new money and an $18mm roll-up ($3.3mm of new money and $6.6mm total interim, representing a 1:1 roll-up to new money); they’ll also get to use their lenders’ cash collateral. There’s a 2% commitment fee (1% upfront, 1% at maturity) on the new money portion. The DIP matures in 90 days, subject to certain milestones. At the first day hearing, the UST expressed some concern over the DIP lenders “materially improving” their position by getting super-priority over the assets of certain entities that weren’t original borrowers but those concerns were — despite the restaurants still having “lovely … Tiffany-style lamps” and “buttons and pins” and “flair” — summarily dismissed (Per Judge Jernigan, “</span><em>I'm not sure any of that is like tremendous new collateral as opposed to the bank already having a lien in the equity.</em><span>”). </span></p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Go-forward?</strong><span> The TL;DR is that this is yet another sh*tty sale case and, as of the petition date, there’s no stalking horse purchaser to anchor the process. That said, there were some encouraging signs. Per debtors’ counsel </span><strong>Chris Dickerson</strong><span> of </span><strong>Ropes &amp; Gray LLP</strong><span>:</span></p><pre><code><code>\"...it's envisioned that it will be an approximately 60-day process. As you will note, we do not yet have an investment banker, but we are actively interviewing them and hope to have one in place here this week. That's required, that's a necessary part of our meeting the milestone that requires us to have filed the sale procedures motion within eight days of the petition date, as well as to identify a stalking horse. We have had numerous pre-petition indications of interest in purchasing some or all of the debtors' assets, including one in which we are pretty far down the road and are working to try to bring to the table as a stocking horse bidder. It is our hope that when we do file the sale procedures motion that it will include a stalking horse bidder. As you would expect, in addition to the handful of parties that we had been dealing with prior to the petition date, we have received numerous indications of interest in participating in that process since the filing, and we will, of course, in conjunction with the investment banker that will be hired by the company, subject to your honor's approval, of course, look to involve as many parties as possible so that we can, again, have a value-maximizing process.\"</code></code></pre><p>Man. Hats off to whomever the banker is that jumps into this pressure cooker! </p><p>We will update this situation soon once we know more about this supposed buyer. </p><h5><span>*</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cdbedfd3-9860-4a50-810b-e13307afe401?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Per LinkedIn</a><span>, Yadav Enterprises is a restaurant franchisee company with 343 restaurants covering six brands; Jack in the Box, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Corner Bakery Cafe, Sizzler and TGI Friday’s.

His is a job that allows for, demands, quiet contemplation. </p><p>Barack Obama had a very different job, one full of meetings and travel and world-changing decisions. While President, Barack Obama read at least 30 minutes every night.

One respondent claimed eight plus.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>The science backs Byrne up: reading improves your ability to focus, slows memory deterioration and enhances memory, boosts verbal skills, and improves your ability to connect different pieces of information and ideas. </p><p>I want to linger on this last point for a second, because to me, it’s one of the most fun parts about reading. It’s a reward that takes a little time to earn, but begins to pay off with increasing frequency the more you read. </p><p>I’ll give a direct example. </p><p><span>Right now, I’m reading </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0b1897fd-150d-4f9b-9392-a8a7cd5d4578?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America’s Banana King</a></em><span>, a truly wonderful book on the life of Sam Zemurray by Rich Cohen. On page 184, Cohen writes about the small socialism problem Zemurray faced in Guatemala during the time of Jacobo Arbenz and Che Guevera, and how the Banana King planned to deal with it. </span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Among the most effective of Zemurray’s government men was </span><strong>Tommy Corcoran</strong><span>, known in the White House and Congress and every tavern in D.C. as Tommy the Cork: you push him down here, he pops up over there… Corcoran briefed Zemurray on the thinking of top government officials. For example, under what conditions would President Truman be willing to go to war on the isthmus? </span></em></p></blockquote><p>Tommy the Cork isn’t a name you forget, particularly when you last read it so recently. </p><p><span>Last week, I read </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/57011680-0719-43fd-85a7-58f438be0aa7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Means of Ascent</a></em><span>, Book Two of Robert Caro’s </span><em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em><span> series. On page 10, Caro describes how FDR had decided to help the young Texan politician after their first meeting in 1937: </span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>It had been </span><strong>Corcoran</strong><span> whom the President had telephoned, upon his return from Texas, to say, “I’ve just met the most remarkable young man” and to issue an order: “help him with anything you can.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p>The same person – a person I’d never heard of until last week – was deputized by FDR to help LBJ and, a decade later, by the Banana King to combat Che! </p><p>That is a very specific connection and one that, apart from writing it here, I don’t know that I’ll ever have the occasion to employ. But stumbling upon the Cork for a second time was better than a dopamine hit; it felt like snapping in a puzzle piece that revealed the full picture. </p><p>Which brings me to a final point: how should you read? Or, what should you read? </p><p>I’ve always read a lot, and I’ve always been frustrated by how little of what I read I retain. I was talking to someone about this a couple weeks ago, someone who reads and remembers much more than I do, and I suggested that my memory is just hopelessly bad, naturally worse than his.</p><p><span>He disagreed with my conclusion : “</span><strong>It’s possible you read too much nonsense. I don’t tend to.</strong><span>” </span></p><p>I thought about that a lot, and I think he’s right. Or, at least, the comment changed the way I think about what and how to read. </p><p>Here, I can bring it back to tech for a second, because this is a newsletter about tech after all, even on election day. </p><p><span>Benchmark partner Sarah Tavel has this idea about building a “</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4c712c95-ea8d-4bf0-b2f1-a8d37aa290ff?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">white hot core</a><span>” when starting a marketplace. The idea is that you shouldn’t try to serve everyone at once, at the beginning, but should begin by nailing the product for a very specific, constrained problem or niche. Prioritize retention over growth. Then, and only then, once your small niche of users really loves your product, you can expand outward into adjacent niches and problems. </span></p><p>I’ve always been a little jealous of the way that it seems people like Byrne and Ben Thompson’s brains work. From the outside, it seems like they have a scaffolding in their brain, and then, whenever any new information comes in, they can simply hang it on that scaffolding. That’s why they can write five excellent essays a week when I struggle to write one. </p><p>I haven’t asked them about this, but what I think is actually happening – other than just raw horsepower – is something similar to Sarah’s white hot core idea. </p><p>Read a lot of high-quality stuff on a certain topic or time period. Recognize connections, reinforce them, prioritize retention over growth. Then, and only then, once your core is established, expand outward. </p><p>It’s like constructing a map instead of dotting a bunch of dots. </p><p><span>In </span><span>Paul Graham writes:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like one in the sense that it spurs some response.</em></p></blockquote><p>I would argue that the same is true for reading. </p><p>The best reading should ordinarily start with what I’m going to call a question, though I mean that in a very general sense.</p><p><span>My current question – though it’s more of an obsession than a question – is trying to learn more about </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/60e6b839-815f-432b-9398-4b1338158728?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vertical Integrators</a><span> than anyone in the world. </span></p><p><span>Over the past couple of months, I’ve read </span><em>American Colossus, The Prize, Saudi Inc., Zero to One, Cable Cowboy, Kochland, My Life and Work, Empires of Light, The Wright Brothers, Dealers of Lightning, The First Tycoon, </em><span>and </span><em>The Fish That Ate the Whale. </em><span>I have about ten more books on the topic loaded on the Kindle and ready to go. The other day, I read a 1990 economics paper that, just last year, might have seemed too dry to finish, but now, read like a Rosetta Stone. </span></p><p>If you asked me a question about facts and figures and people and theories, the kinds of questions my weak memory never would have been able to handle before, I can actually answer them! </p><p><span>And when I read an off-topic book, like </span><em>Means of Ascent</em><span>, that takes place in a similar time period, I can see connections there, too. The obvious ones, like “Tommy the Cork shows up in both,” and less obvious ones, like the fact that both LBJ and Zemurray justified any means in the pursuit of their ends. </span></p><p><span>There’s one theme that pops up over and over again, one that might be relevant on a day like today, when half the country will inevitably think that the world is ending, that forces of evil beyond their control have doomed the country and their own lives to chaos and decline: </span><strong>agency</strong><span>. </span></p><blockquote><p><em>The greatness of Zemurray lies in the fact that he never lost faith in his ability to salvage a situation. Bad things happened to him as bad things happen to everyone, but unlike so many he was never tempted by failure. He never felt powerless or trapped. He was, as I said, an optimist. He stood in constant defiance.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>There are similar passages in the books on LBJ, Vanderbilt, Ford, the Wright Brothers, the Koch Brothers, Westinghouse, Edison, and Malone. Reading about all of these people in rapid succession – people who lived and built in a time when the world was a much harsher place than ours is today – provides a reminder that whatever happens outside of you, </span><strong>you can choose to give up or you can look at the board as it is and figure out how to play your next move. </strong></p><p>Maybe as importantly as the specifics, reading gives you an understanding that everything that you think is novel and terrifying has happened before, and that people have survived. </p><p><span>So I’ll leave you with a passage from CS Lewis that </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3c1d5090-e182-43ac-b633-ae55ff30bb54?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Michael Dempsey tweeted this morning</a><span>: </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ed4b8f37-b1dc-4fe3-a644-5f072ae543f6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1632,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2812702-0d0f-4e30-8f81-4ccae11af3a5_816x1600.png\"></a></figure></div><p>“If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things – praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts – not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

That’s not to say things will be perfect.

On Tuesday, you get a vote — a say in who will hold that office — but you get to vote on something more important every day after Tuesday, too. You get to vote on what you work on and how you do it. You get to vote on whether you spend your precious time yelling about how terrible the other side is, or whether you spend it rolling up your sleeves to make your family, your community, the country, and the world just a little bit better in the ways you can control. </p><p>That’s the beauty of this system.

More people scent us this news than any story in Dose history. </p><p>Can you smell what Osmo is cooking?</p><p>Probably not yet, but soon you might be able to. Osmo Labs, the startup trying to digitize scent, just completed the first teleportation of scent in history.</p><p>Well, teleportation might not be the exact right term. Here’s how it works: Osmo created a \"Principal Odor Map\" that can predict how a molecule will smell based solely on its chemical structure. This allows them to digitally explore billions of potential molecules and predict their scents without physically synthesizing them, greatly accelerating the process of discovering new fragrances and aroma compounds. The POM then generates a formula to recreate the scent, sends the formula to a specialized printer, which then uses a combination of scent ingredients to “print” the smell. Watch the video above to get a better idea of how it works.</p><p>Vision and hearing have been digitized for decades and that digitization has shaped our digital world experiences. But smell has never been digitized, and its our oldest and deepest sense. Ever wonder why you can precisely remember the smell of your mom’s cooking but can recall like two words from that Youtube cooking video you watched? Our sense of smell is just much, much stronger than our other senses. In fact, it’s directly connected to the brain's limbic system, where emotions and memories are processed.</p><p>Digitizing smell — and thing bringing that ability to digital experiences — could meaningfully enrich the ways we interact online. That’s certainly a big, ambitious goal, but you could certainly imagine Osmo first capitalizing on its breakthrough to disrupt the $30B flavor and fragrance market before creating a world as rich in scents as it is in scenes and sounds. </p><p><em>Wang et al in Alzheimer’s Association</em><span> </span></p><blockquote><p><em>Semaglutide was associated with 40% to 70% reduced risks of first-time AD diagnosis in T2DM patients compared to other antidiabetic medications, including other GLP-1RAs.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a81a37b8-73e4-452e-b8ff-d3f834752e72?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1114,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F908bec56-a59d-40c7-a860-6d981f484a45_557x557.webp\"></a></figure></div><p>A large study suggests semaglutide may lower Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk among high-risk type 2 diabetes patients, because, of course it may.  </p><p>The study reviewed health records of over 1 million patients, and found semaglutide reduced AD diagnosis risk by a whopping 40-70% compared to other antidiabetic medications, with the strongest effect observed against insulin. The benefit was consistent across age, gender, and obesity status, suggesting semaglutide's neuroprotective potential beyond glycemic control.</p><p>To be clear, the study does not suggest that semaglutide is a “cure” or even a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer’s. What the study does suggest is that semaglutide is more preventative than other diabetes drugs, like insulin or metformin, in lowering Alzheimer’s risk. </p><p>How can this be? The obesity-drug may reduce neuroinflammation and improve insulin sensitivity in the brain, which can protect against the buildup of harmful proteins linked that have been linked to Alzheimer’s. Additionally, semaglutide may enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress, both of which are critical in preventing neurodegeneration.</p><p>Semaglutide this. Semaglutide that. We’re starting to sound like a broken record here. But hey, there’s rarely a week that goes by where a compelling study on semaglutide’s impact doesn’t drop. And if semglutide keeps dropping the hits, we’ll keep playing them.</p><p><em>Physical Intelligence (π)</em><span> </span></p><blockquote><p><em>In the same way that LLMs provide a foundation model for language, these generalist robot policies will provide a robot foundation model for physical intelligence.</em></p></blockquote><div><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7eb4dcc7-e989-48d6-97b7-f41df70979b8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,h_618,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/l_play_button_usfui2,w_144,e_colorize:0/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F150978763%2Fff6c9f85-d59d-482f-b1bf-7b72e48781eb%2Ftranscoded-00001.png\"></a></div><p>Packy here. One of the questions I think a lot about is why people were so much more optimistic about technology in the past than they are today. Some of this is Glory Days Syndrome — if you read clippings from the time, people protested every new technology — but some of it is that new inventions made a dramatic and positive difference in people’s lives in ways that they could easily measure. </p><p><span>Washing machines are perhaps the most famous example. With electric washing machines, the time to do a load of laundry dropped from 4 hours to </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cd63f68f-1b5b-4670-96d2-b2baf4781b1b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">41 minutes</a><span>. Overall, electric appliances cut the average household’s weekly housework from 58 to 18 hours per week. That 40 hour delta just so happens to be the same amount of hours that are in a standard workweek. Jeremy Greenwood and others have made a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5cf6e123-fc0f-478a-8a4a-7c5f2f581ba5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">compelling argument</a><span> that electricity and labor-saving household appliances led to a dramatic increase in women’s workforce participation. </span></p><p>From that perspective, we are so back. Physical Intelligence (π), which is building “foundation models and learning algorithms to power the robots of today and the physically-actuated devices of the future,” released its first generalist policy for robots in the form of a blog post, paper, and videos. Lots of videos. Front and center — in the blog post and the company’s tweets — they showed off robots folding laundry. </p><p>Folding laundry the way humans would is both an incredibly hard technical challenge — “while a single t-shirt laid flat on the table can sometimes be folded just by repeating a pre-scripted set of motions, a pile of tangled laundry can be crumpled in many different ways, so it is not enough to simply move the arms through the same motion. To our knowledge, no prior robot system has been demonstrated to perform this task at this level of complexity” — and a beautifully symbolic one. </p><p>The promise of machines is to free humans from the tasks we don’t want to do. Sometimes, that’s a euphemism for “anything a robot can do more cheaply than humans,” but sometimes, it’s just things we actually don’t want to do. </p><p><span>Folding laundry is one of my </span><em>least </em><span>favorite things to do. I will leave clothes in the dryer for days to avoid it. I, for one, welcome our new robot laundry lords. </span></p><p><em>Gina Kolata for The New York Times</em></p><blockquote><p><em>A study of 407 people with obesity and knee osteoarthritis found those who got semaglutide had an average reduction of 41.7 points on a 100-point scale while those who got the placebo had a reduction of 27.5 points.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fef42e7e-9b48-4447-9b6a-eb8e037da8b5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F743de167-8c42-4320-92cd-840fcdeb1b34_767x501.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>And right on cue — fricken semaglutide out here solving knee pain issues!

And by the time of the October 21 hearing on the bidding procedures motion, Nexus </span><em>still</em><span> hadn’t secured commitment letters that would prove it could close.</span></p><p>And while the debtors were able to satisfy the UCC objection by adding language that ensured the bid protections would only become effective IF Nexus obtains the necessary commitment letters by October 23 (the bid deadline), the UST persisted, leading to a contested hearing.</p><p><span>The UST didn’t think the bid protections (break-up fee + expense reimbursement) were warranted and, even if allowed, definitely shouldn’t be given super priority status. </span><strong>Judge Stickles</strong><span> would rule on this at a later hearing, but, first, the court made its position known early on during the October 21 hearing:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“I am struggling very much in this case with a stalking horse who … essentially got a contingent commitment … as to why this isn’t being heard with respect to bid protections at a later hearing.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Timing is important here. Again, the hearing happened on Monday, October 21. The debtors were proposing that Nexus would have to cough up their proof of financing by Wednesday, October 23, which also happened to be the bid deadline. So Judge Stickles was a little perplexed:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Bids are due the same day that Nexus is supposed to get commitment, correct? So how does this play to other bidders?”</em></p><p><em>“So they have to meet a minimum overbid even if the financing isn’t available for Nexus?”</em></p><p><em>“Is [Nexus] even a qualified bidder?”</em></p><p><em>“Let me just ask the fundamental question: why is this being pushed today when in 48 hours you’re going to know whether or not they have financing? Why wasn’t the whole schedule modified to coincide with the ability to have financing so people know truly what the floor is?”</em></p></blockquote><p>Great questions, Judge Stickles!</p><p>Here’s a live shot of the debtors, under fire from the bench: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/07096b6c-7c84-4fd1-a8c2-73125416e4c5?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_320,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbed0ac4-f6d0-481b-bd92-95e952432bcb_266x200.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>After convening with the stalking horse and coming back for a follow-up hearing on October 25, the debtors agreed to push (i) the bid deadline to October 28 at 12pm ET and (ii) the auction to October 30 at 10am ET. During that same hearing the debtors also confirmed that Nexus had finally obtained commitment letters, so we can finally close the book on that dumb-as-all-holy-f*ck issue. Judge Stickles, who nailed the idiocy of this timeline, gave her ruling on the UST objections.</p><p>And? </p><p>She approved Nexus’ bid protections, but agreed with the UST that the bid protections should not be given super priority status. We’re chalking this one up as a win for the newly emboldened and empowered UST.</p><p>Now with Nexus having secured financing and Judge Stickles streamlining the schedule and ruling on the bid protections issue, we look forward to any potential surprise bidders in advance of a sale hearing scheduled for November 12 at 1:30pm ET.</p><h3><strong>📤 Notice📤</strong></h3><p><strong>Esther Hong</strong><span> (Associate) joined </span><strong>Glenn Agre Bergman &amp; Fuentes LLP</strong><span> from Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP. </span></p><h3>🍾Congratulations to…🍾</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Olya Antle</strong><span> of Cooley LLP (Washington, D.C.)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Gemma Bellfield</strong><span> of Ogier (Camana Bay, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Lauren Berret</strong><span> of Eisner Advisory Group, LLC (Philadelphia)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Joseph Boufadel</strong><span> of Salvato Boufadel LLP (Los Angeles)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Annmarie Chiarello</strong><span> of Winstead PC (Dallas)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rahman Connelly</strong><span> of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (New York)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Elliot Crowder</strong><span> of Stevenson &amp; Bullock, P.L.C.

First to win three points wins the whole pot. The game ends early.

Player A gets the next point, he wins. Player B gets the next point, it’s tied at 2-2 and the odds are back to 50/50. So Player A has a 75% chance of winning: 50% of winning immediately + (50% * 50%) in the tied scenario. Player B has a 25% chance of winning. They should actually split the pot 3:1. </span></p><p>Pascal and Fermat wrote to each other at the height of the Scientific Revolution, a period whose output – the scientific method, heliocentricity, and Pascal’s expected value, among many other contributions – we take for granted today. But imagine being alive then.</p><p>Just as modern humans look at everything in the world and ask, “What if we applied AI to that,” the Scientific Revolution’s intelligentsia looked at everything in the world and asked, “What if we apply a rational, mathematical approach to that?” </p><p>And there was no bigger “that” than the God question. </p><p>Instead of deciding whether to believe in God based on trust in priests or even reasoning about God’s existence, Pascal put his new probabilistic toolkit to work. </p><ul><li><p>If God exists and you believe, you get infinite reward: eternal paradise. </p></li><li><p>If God exists and you don't believe, you get infinite punishment: eternal damnation. </p></li><li><p>If God doesn't exist, whether you believe or not leads to only finite outcomes - maybe some lifestyle changes or social consequences.</p></li></ul><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/873c4587-26b7-48f2-9b08-e11e88b82623?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F280ef796-c153-4116-b411-91c730339474_908x367.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Pascal’s Wager</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The math was clear: any finite cost was worth paying for even a tiny chance of gaining infinite upside or avoiding infinite downside. No matter how small the probability, the infinite overwhelms the finite. </p><p><span>As Pascal concludes, </span><strong>“If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.”</strong><span> This is Pascal’s Wager. </span></p><p><span>Infinity is a brain-breaking concept. When I was six years old, I would run into my parents’ room at night, trembling at the thought that it just never ends. So you die, and then what? What if you I went to hell and my parents went to heaven? We would be separated… forever? Try as I might – “What about 100 years after that? What about </span><em>10,000</em><span> years after that?” – I couldn’t reach the end. </span></p><p><span>Somehow, I’ve infected Dev with a less morbid version of the same fascination; practically every day, he comes to me with a new proposed workaround to infinity’s infiniteness. He’s just decided that if you add something less than infinity to infinity, it’s still infinity; but if you multiply infinity </span><em>by</em><span> infinity, it’s a new, bigger thing, “tenty.” </span></p><p>But nothing is bigger than infinity. Infinity is so large that it will always overwhelm the finite.</p><p>When faced with potentially infinite outcomes - whether infinite upside or infinite downside - humans respond differently than we do to merely large numbers. Which is how you get the Manhattan Project, and why it’s proven impossible to create the Manhattan Project for X when the stakes are not infinite.</p><p>When infinity enters the equation, normal cost-benefit analysis breaks down. Any finite cost is worth paying for even a tiny chance at infinite upside or to avoid infinite downside.</p><p>When infinite stakes appear, impossible things become fundable.</p><p>I am using infinity loosely here, but you get the point. </p><p><strong>Infinity Missions </strong><span>– whether avoiding infinite downside, pursuing infinite upside, or both – are responsible for some of humanity’s biggest achievements. </span></p><h3><strong>Fighting Infinite Downside</strong></h3><p><strong>Historically, most Infinity Missions have fought to prevent infinite downside, and were funded by the government.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Facing threats that might wipe out humanity – infinite loss – there is almost no amount of money that governments are not willing to spend on solutions. That’s how you spend 1% of the government budget on a single weapon. </p><p><span>The </span><strong>Manhattan Project</strong><span> is the most famous example. The goal was existential: get the nuclear bomb before the Nazis did, win the war, and prevent the Nazi nuclear armageddon. The resources it consumed reflected that: roughly 1% of the government budget and 0.4% of US GDP, and as importantly, concentrated many of the world’s smartest people – Oppenheimer, Fermi, von Neumann, Feynman, Teller, Szilard, Bethe, Lawrence, Ulam – in Los Alamos. Overall, the US government spent nearly 40% of US GDP in the effort to win World War II. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2ed3694d-d8a7-4090-a0c0-61ae901abf20?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bdc4485-37ec-4f29-8cec-1a824203bfe0_908x598.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Oppenheimer, Groves, and others at Trinity Test Site </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>They succeeded, unleashing both destruction and peace, and lasting advances in nuclear power, nuclear medicine, radioisotope dating, computers, materials science, and the national laboratory system. </p><p>There were spies among the ranks at Los Alamos, however, including Klaus Fuchs, who gave nuclear secrets to the Soviets in part to maintain the global power balance by ensuring Mutually Assured Destruction.

And those rules look surprisingly consistent across every Infinity Mission, whether it's Los Alamos in 1942 or OpenAI in 2024.</p><h3><strong>The Rules of Infinity</strong></h3><p>Traditional projects, those with finite upside or downside, face constraints in time, talent, exploration costs, and infrastructure. Infinity blows those constraints out. </p><h4><strong>Time</strong></h4><p>Normal projects face artificial time constraints: quarterly earnings targets, maximum payback periods, pressure to prove profitability in a reasonable timeframe. They are treadmills at a slight incline: a constant struggle to hit goals that get slightly higher every quarter. </p><p>Infinity Missions are a sprinting marathon to a goal. Decades-long commitments become possible, but while long time horizons can be an advantage, decades are not the point. The thing is to get there first. </p><p>The Manhattan Project lasted three intense years, from 1942-1945, until the Americans developed the bomb. The current race to AGI has been an all-out sprint for less than three years, and the sprint will continue until the Digital Gods take over or until scaling laws fall off. Work until it’s done. </p><p><span>These missions </span><em>can </em><span>take a long time. SpaceX has been working towards colonizing Mars for more than two decades, and they may have decades left. But with a big, clear, practically infinite goal in mind, there is a constant push driving towards that goal as opposed to quarterly pressures. </span></p><p>On a recent podcast, Marc Andreessen called “What makes Elon Musk so effective?” the most important question in the world, and answered that it boils down to the question, “What did you get done this week?” </p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c45d6bd0-eb56-417d-9489-f52381bc81b1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/6twxFu3bL0w\"></a><p>Identifying the bottleneck and making progress week after week for decades compounds until the goal is achieved. That can be draining! Most companies couldn’t get away with that! </p><p>But the rules are different for Infinity Missions. They attract and concentrate insanely talented people and pull their best work out for as long as it takes. </p><h4><strong>Talent</strong></h4><p>How do you get Robert Oppenheimer, Johnny von Neumann, Richard Feynman, and Enrico Fermi to move to shacks in the middle of nowhere for an indefinite time period at the height of their careers? Infinity.</p><p>Certainly, the military can use the threat of force to compel people to do something that they otherwise would not choose to, but in the case of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer persuaded the world’s best scientists through persuasion, appeals to patriotism, and the opportunity to prevent an infinite downside scenario. </p><p>The opportunity to work on problems with infinite impact is the ultimate talent magnet. </p><p>This holds true today, with professors leaving tenure track positions to work on AI and with the insane talent density at Elon Musk’s companies, particularly SpaceX. </p><p><span>What’s notable about SpaceX in particular is the deep commitment to the mission and the insanely hard work that pulls out of people. My favorite example of this is the fact that Doug Bernauer left SpaceX to build a nuclear company, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7bb91210-c437-43c8-ba98-0153f7b60cd2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Radiant</a><span>, when he realized that we wouldn’t be able to settle Mars, even if we’re able to get there, without transportable nuclear power. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5fedfb1e-32b1-4564-9f68-3beecd52ddfa?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2098,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22d58ec4-b00b-4fdc-987d-e22c7c4e218e_1049x350.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Doug Bernauer</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Some of this is certainly marketing. Mars is a long way off. But it is also self-fulfilling. Setting a plausibly infinite mission attracts the type of people who have the best chance of pulling it off, and gives them the opportunity to work on things that other companies might view as wasteful. </p><h4><strong>“Wasteful” Exploration and Government-Scale Infrastructure</strong></h4><p>Time and talent are critical, but there are certainly companies not on Infinity Missions that work on very long time horizons and attract incredible people. Infinity Missions amp those characteristics up, but they don’t fundamentally change them. Smart people have to work somewhere. </p><p>What makes Infinity Missions particularly unique is that they allow for investments in exploration that would seem wasteful in a finite context. </p><p>This has traditionally been the role of government – funding basic research and serving as premium demand for new, valuable capabilities – and is enhanced when the government pursues Infinity Missions to fend off existential threats. </p><p>Increasingly, private companies are funding, and even open sourcing, investments that would seem extravagant or wasteful in the context of more finite returns. </p><p><span>Go back to the Larry Page quote: </span><em><strong>\"I am willing to go bankrupt rather than lose this race.\"</strong></em></p><p>Hyperscalers and foundation model companies are making investments that previously only governments would have or could have. </p><p>They are buying their own nuclear reactors. They are investing tens of billions of dollars in data centers. They are building out research labs and pursuing paths that will inevitably lead to dead-ends. And they are creating, and often open sourcing, new frameworks and technological breakthroughs. </p><p><span>Examples are littered throughout Mohit Agarwal’s excellent </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3f54b4ab-41a8-4e30-a261-92d6ab0f050b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Future of Compute: NVIDIA’s Crown is Slipping</a></em><span>, including Google’s JAX, Microsoft and OpenAI’s Triton, Meta’s PyTorch and Open Compute Project. They’re building new fiber optic networks, developing higher-bandwidth ethernet, and creating custom optical transceivers, DSPs, and optical switches. </span></p><p>The infinite upside potential of AGI is driving companies to fund basic research that would traditionally have been:</p><ol><li><p>Too fundamental for private investment</p></li><li><p>Too long-term to justify to shareholders</p></li><li><p>Too infrastructure-focused for any single company</p></li><li><p>More like public goods than proprietary tech</p></li></ol><p>They’re able to make counterintuitive investments because of the size of the prize, and because the size of the effort required to attain it enables more extreme vertical integration than a finite company could pursue. </p><h4><strong>Vertical Integration</strong></h4><p><span>In the essay, Mohit makes another point relevant to our conversation: on long timescales, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0f406d78-bfea-4262-9fa0-d9dc8b212fbc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">vertical integration</a><span> is a huge advantage. I would amend it to say that on infinite scales, vertical integration is necessary. He argues that while NVIDIA is king now, the hyperscalers’ vertical integration will likely win out in the end. </span></p><p>Why this is true is fascinating. </p><p><span>Given the size and scope of the effort required, things that wouldn’t make economic sense for a normal company to build themselves are </span><em>necessary</em><span> for hyperscalers to build themselves. As Mohit writes: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>Simultaneously, the sheer scale of compute needs has hit limits on capex, power availability, and infrastructure development. This is driving an enormous shift towards distributed, vertically-integrated, and co-optimized systems (chips, racks, networking, cooling, infrastructure software, power) that NVIDIA is ill-prepared to supply.</em></p></blockquote><p>Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple are all developing their own chips at enormous expense. While traditional companies might justify such investments based on future cost savings, these companies are building chips for capabilities that don't exist yet, for models they haven't designed yet, at scales that normal ROI calculations can't justify. They're building the infrastructure for infinite opportunities they can glimpse but not yet fully articulate.</p><p>Of course, if they’re right, if the opportunity is as infinite as they are betting it is, they may be able to make back the spend in margin they’re not paying NVIDIA, but that is a bet and a secondary consideration. A normal market would not support five companies building some of the hardest and most expensive-to-build components in the world when a network of highly skilled suppliers exists and is competing for their business, driving costs down and performance up over time. But this is not a normal market. It’s an Infinity Mission. </p><p>Like previous government-funded Infinity Missions, these efforts will have an impact beyond the projects themselves. </p><h4><strong>The Spillover Effect</strong></h4><p>The immunity to normal constraints accelerates the development of capabilities that the rest of the market can take advantage of. This is the point of government-funded research, and increasingly, it’s being funded by private companies. </p><ul><li><p>Manhattan Project → Nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and more</p></li><li><p>Space Race → Satellites, GPS, materials science, and more</p></li><li><p>Climate Crisis → cheaper solar panels and batteries, synthetic fuels, fusion funding</p></li><li><p>AGI race → Open source AI tools, networking advances, and more</p></li></ul><p>The AGI Race diffusion is already happening. In a fantastic interview on First Principles, Somos Internet founder Forrest Heath talks about borrowing data center networking architecture to bring fast, cheap internet (as high as 100 Gbps for $80/month) to cities in Colombia: </p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/adad4ae9-6b5f-4942-b10d-17c6cb32f5f2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/17aAP1rGfMk\"></a><p>While some of the architecture and components are taken from traditional data centers, the race to birth the Digital Gods has contributed to a “Moore’s Law-like curve” in laser modules “being driven not necessarily by us but by the massive consumption in data centers,” as one example.</p><p>From this perspective, the Infinite Upside Infinity Missions aren’t too dissimilar from Bell Labs, the other thing, along with the Manhattan Project, that people who love progress want to bring back. </p><h3><strong>The Bell Labs Carveout</strong></h3><p>We can’t talk about big projects that have pushed or pulled technology forward without talking about Bell Labs, so a brief aside. </p><p>Founded in 1925 inside of AT&amp;T’s telephone monopoly with the express purpose of improving telephony, it sits somewhere in between a government-funded Infinite Downside protection project and a privately-funded Infinite Upside project. </p><p><span>It represents an artificial Infinity Mission: a kind of </span><strong>Pascal’s Wager with house money</strong><span>. </span></p><p>AT&amp;T was regulated as a utility. Profits were effectively capped and had to be justified to regulators. Excess profits would trigger rate reductions. One way to reduce profits was to funnel money into R&amp;D, which AT&amp;T did better than anyone else. </p><p>Bell Labs produced the transistor (1947), photovoltaic cells (1954), Unix (1969), information theory (1947), cellular technology (1947), continuous wave lasers (1958), digital imaging sensors (1969), and communications satellites (1962), among other fundamental inventions. </p><p><strong>One way to view Bell Labs was as a way to funnel profits that AT&amp;T wasn’t allowed to earn in the present into goodwill and defensibility of those profits over the long term through innovation and technological moats. </strong></p><p>It was a kind of quasi-governmental organization, with the then-Infinite-seeming Upside of monopolizing the country’s long-distance wires, and the Infinite Downside protection against losing that monopoly. </p><p><span>As Tim Wu writes in </span><em>The Master Switch, </em><span>“In the United States, the higher consumer prices resulting from monopoly amounted, in effect, to a tax on Americans to fund basic research.” </span></p><p>That research created positive externalities – many of which we’ve discussed already, from chips, to solar panels, to lasers – and it also protected AT&amp;T.</p><p>In 1934, a Bell Labs engineer named Clarence Hickman invented magnetic tape to be used in answering machines. That invention wouldn’t be discovered until 1994. “AT&amp;T ordered the Labs to cease all research into magnetic storage, and Hickman’s research was suppressed and concealed for more than sixty years,” Wu writes, because “AT&amp;T firmly believed that the answering machine, and its magnetic tapes, would lead the public to abandon the telephone.” </p><p>That is the crack, the flaw in this third approach, “the essential weakness of a centralized approach to innovation,” as Wu explains it:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>Yes, Bell Labs was great. But AT&amp;T, as an innovator, bore a serious genetic flaw: it could not originate technologies that might, by the remotest possibility, threaten the Bell System. In the language of innovation theory, the output of the Bell Labs was practically restricted to </span><strong>sustaining innovations; </strong><span>disruptive technologies, those that might even cast a shadow of uncertainty over the business model, were simply out of the question.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Along with the answering machine, Bell Labs “would for years suppress or fail to market: fiber optics, mobile telephones, digital subscriber lines (DSL), fax machines, speakerphones - the list goes on and on.” </p><p><span>We bemoan the inability to launch modern Manhattan Projects and create modern Bell Labs, but contrast this with Larry Page’s </span><strong>willingness to go bankrupt</strong><span> to achieve AGI. Perhaps regulated monopoly status prevented both the downsides and the upsides from reaching infinity, which threw the wager out of whack. </span></p><p>We may not see more Manhattan Projects or Bell Labs in forms that look like the Manhattan Project or Bell Labs, and that’s OK. Privately-funded Infinity Missions chasing infinite upside may be their new form.</p><h3><strong>Back to Infinity</strong></h3><p>Privately funded infinity missions are not without their drawbacks, either. </p><p>If you believe the AGI x-risk crowd, the infinite profit motive is driving these companies to push humanity to the brink whether we like it or not. Private companies don’t have the checks that government-regulated monopolies or government-funded projects do. </p><p><span>That said, as Tyler Cowen </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6b5e1ae3-a62a-4116-aa8d-56105ba6c22e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">points out</a><span>, the Effective Altruist camp is not putting its money where its mouth is by shorting the market, and the market overall does not seem to price in a high probability that the world is about to end. </span></p><p><span>Whatever your belief, </span><strong>I expect that we will see companies funding Infinity Missions more frequently than governments going forward. </strong></p><p><span>Personally, I think that’s a good thing, as it represents </span><strong>a shift from governments needing to protect against civilization-level threats to companies racing to capture civilization-level opportunities</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Why? There are a few reasons. </p><p><span>Technology is </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/994548a6-387b-4c88-85b2-a7e0eac9f73f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">exponential</a><span>, and we’ve reached a point in our and its evolution at which there are simply more infinite upside opportunities. </span></p><p>Capital markets are better at appreciating and pricing potential infinite upside than governments are. Governments are best-suited for downside protection; private markets for maximizing upside. And even when the capital markets are wrong – as they were in the internet bubble and may certainly be in the race to AGI – humanity tends to benefit from their overinvestment. </p><p><span>Funded by those capital markets, private companies now have the resources rivaling governments. It’s not the first time that’s happened – describing Cornelius Vanderbilt in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d7c7491f-f44c-4651-b58d-d0b07f866a45?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The First Tycoon</a></em><span>, T.J. Stiles wrote, “If he had been able to sell all his assets at full market value at the moment of his death, in January of that year, he would have taken one out of every twenty dollars in circulation, including cash and demand deposits.” – but it is happening at unprecedented scale, and distributed amongst enough companies that they are forced to compete those fortunes against each other. </span></p><p><span>Plus, more of our brightest minds are going into industry than into research or government, a phenomenon I applauded in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d4b15259-393e-4412-b0da-77bd637c6199?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">OpenAI &amp; Grand Strategy</a></em><span>: “Count me among those who would rather our best people start companies to achieve goals no old-time general could have dreamed of than kill each other by the hundreds of thousands in pursuit of lesser ones.” War is still terrible, but it is no longer the best way to win glory. </span></p><p><span>Upside achievement is more appealing than downside protection. If you “win” a nuclear war, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/12b04b6a-56f3-4487-be16-44aafce7ebc0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">everyone, probably you included, dies</a><span>. If you achieve AGI, you get unfathomably rich and probably usher humanity into a new golden era. </span></p><p>Finally, it is more possible than ever to reach towards (although never actually to) infinity: to scale globally, and beyond. </p><p>We’ve just touched on one Infinite Upside Infinity Mission – AGI – but space may be another. </p><p>SpaceX is currently in the enviable position of controlling access beyond the earth, and is in the pole position to make humans multiplanetary. That kind of Infinity Mission has attracted some of the world’s most talented people to happily work unthinkable hours in its pursuit. It is both Infinite Downside protection in the case of emergency on Earth and Infinite Upside opportunity as the economy expands to include more of the universe. </p><p>There will be more: longevity seems a particularly infinite pursuit. How much would you pay to avoid Pascal’s Wager altogether? </p><p>All three of these cases – AGI, Space, and Longevity – represent a version of Pascal’s Wager more true to the original bet. They both promise infinite upside and threaten infinite downside. </p><p>Achieving AGI might usher in utopia, and some argue that if we let China get there first, we face infinite downside. </p><p>Extending Earth’s economy throughout the universe offers infinite upside, and failing to make ourselves multiplanetary – subjecting ourselves to the risk of putting all of our eggs in one planetary basket – exposes us to infinite downside. </p><p>Longevity offers the hope of living forever. Failing to do so leaves us doomed to be dead for all eternity, the thing that so freaked me out about infinity as a little kid. </p><p>The promise and threat of infinity will drive investments that don’t make sense in a finite expected value calculation, but that will accelerate progress towards those goals in the process. It’s capitalism with an irrational turbobooster. </p><p>If nothing else, the infinity framing is a useful way to understand why the government can be so good at some things and so bad at others. </p><p>We pulled off Operation Warpspeed in part because, at the time, COVID seemed like an existential threat. We can’t seem to get our healthcare system in order because it’s more frog-in-boiling-pot. </p><p>It also shows where companies can do what people expect governments to. We’ve talked about the $42 billion government-funded rural internet product that has produced very little rural internet. SpaceX, on the other hand, is able to provide rural internet – most recently for disaster relief after the Hurricanes in North Carolina – because it’s an orthogonal way to fund the company’s Infinity Mission. </p><p>If the government feels like it’s stagnating, like it couldn’t possibly pull off another Manhattan Project, that’s OK. It’s almost to be expected. We look to the government for protection, not transcendence. </p><p>It even makes sense. Politicians will be long out of office by the time any Infinity Mission they fund comes close to fruition. Their incentive is to produce short-term, finite upside while protecting against infinite downside. </p><p><span>Fortunately, infinity applied to future profits is financially overwhelming enough that companies </span><em>are </em><span>incentivized to pursue Infinity Missions, no matter how small their probability of success or how much it costs today. Now that infinity is on the table, I expect it will pull progress further and faster than we’ve seen in the past. </span></p><p>Avoiding Hell is necessary, but not sufficient. The real point of the Wager is to reach Heaven.</p><p>That’s all for today. We’ll be back in your inbox on Friday with a Weekly Dose. </p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>Packy</p></div>",

We have the whole thing written and ready to go, and then boom: Bloomberg reports that TSMC’s Arizona manufacturing facility is producing chips at 4% higher yields than similar facilities in Taiwan. </span></p><p>That is huge. We’re optimists, and frankly, we were a little worried about TSMC’s ability to manufacture here. Less skilled labor, safety and management issues, all the things that normally get in the way of building things. TSMC pushed back its plans to start full production here by a year, then pushed back the launch date for the second fab. </p><p>And then they go and totally redeem themselves. Now, these are 4nm chips, not the 3nm chips TSMC makes at home, but a 4% improvement in yields shows that we can manufacture these complex little wafers here, might unlock billions in additional CHIPS Act funding, and might push TSMC to open all six possible fabs in Phoenix. </p><p>The way things are heading, we’re going to produce oodles of chips powered by gigawatts of nuclear energy while eagles fly overhead, kids eat apple pie, and someone terraforms the Arizona dessert in the background. Out with the longshoremen, in with the onshoremen. </p><p><em>Knierim et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a61148e5-5e1e-4268-a84e-29994c081688?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feea1d92a-6c9d-4622-9fc7-5bfc4238389b_1538x804.png\"></a></figure></div><p>About 6 weeks ago, we covered the lithium boom in the the Smackover Formation region of the United States. That story covered how one particular entrepreneur was planning to use Direct Lithium Extraction, a methodology he developed back in the 90s, across one particular region of the southeast referred to as the Smackover Foundation.</p><p><span>A paper recently published in </span><em>Science </em><span>confirmed that that entrepreneur is on the right track. The researchers identified a substantial lithium resource in southern Arkansas. Using an AI model trained on geological, geochemical, and temperature data, the team predicted lithium concentrations across the region and estimated the formation contains between 5.1 and 19 million tons of lithium, or about 35% to 136% of the current U.S. lithium resource estimate. Lithium boom baby!</span></p><p>If the U.S. is going to usher in a clean, renewable future, it’s going to need access to a lot more lithium — the essential mineral for building EV batteries and other clean tech.

But we’ll still need technologies that capture and remove the CO2 that has and will continue to make its way out into the world. </p><p><span>Luckily, Cal Berkeley researchers have developed </span><strong>COF-999</strong><span>, a new porous, crystalline organic material that efficiently captures carbon dioxide directly from open air. The material functions like a specialized sponge made of a porous material, with tiny holes throughout. These pores are designed to selectively attract and trap carbon dioxide molecules from the air as it passes through. Then, when the material is gently heated, it releases the captured CO₂, allowing COF-999 to be reused for continuous carbon capture.</span></p><p>Someone like Terraform Industries or Valar Atomics can turn the CO₂ into fuel, that fuel will be used to power planes, and those planes can keep sprinkling COF-999.

One thing I do know: I was blind but now I see.</em></p><p><span>Science (</span><em>the Corporation, not the field of study</em><span>) released very promising preliminary results from clinical trials of its PRIMA retinal implant. The PRIMA system is a wireless, autonomous implant that works with special glasses and a pocket processor to enhance visual clarity. Essentially the glasses capture an image and that image is transported to an implant in the patients eye that allows them a to “see” a version of that image.</span></p><p>The implant restored meaningful vision to individuals who had lost their central visual field, enabling them to read sequences of letters and even longer texts. After 12 months, patients showed an average improvement of 23 letters (4.6 lines) in visual acuity, with the best patient improving by 59 letters (11.8 lines). Meaning, the trial participants went from being blind to being able to read short passages.</p><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are going to get a lot better in the coming years.

In my head it always goes back to flipbook animation. That’s the technique where sequential drawings on pages are flipped rapidly to create the illusion of motion. You likely made a flipbook animation in first grade. It was exhausting and shitty. So when I see animated films today, I always imagine a team of artists flipbooking their way through an intricate 2 hour long movie. Reader, that’s now how animation works today and it hasn’t worked this way in a long, long time. But if you’re like me and that’s your base-level understanding of animation than this new product from Runway is going to blow your mind.</p><p>Runway’s Act-One generates expressive character animations using only an actor's video and voice—no extra equipment required. By capturing the nuances of facial expressions and performances, Act-One translates real-life acting into digital characters, even when proportions differ from the source.</p><p><span>It’s always kinda funny in the animated movies when the character kind of resembles the actor (</span><em>although it’s even funnier when the character is totally different than the actor</em><span>.) Like Maui in </span><em>Moana. </em><span>The Rock was born to play Maui and Maui was likely created to be perfect for The Rock. This tech takes that connection to a whole other level and does so in a low-cost, no equipment way.</span></p><p><em><strong>From Anthropic: </strong></em><strong><span> </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b79c9c01-79fa-4bbe-840b-1cefe1d06518?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Computer Use</a></strong></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1287aae5-4171-4854-9510-3af565963457?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ODaHJzOyVCQ\"></a><p>Anthropic introduced a new capability called \"computer use\" for its Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model. Computer Use allows Claude to interact with computers in ways similar to human user. It can perform tasks like moving the cursor, clicking buttons, typing text, and switching between windows or applications. You know, things we mere mortals regularly do on computers. Claude is essentially interpreting screenshots to understand what's on the screen and to determine how to complete given tasks.</p><p>You don’t have to extrapolate the demo of computer use too many years down the line to see how a technology like this could be disruptive. The majority of knowledge work done today consists of interpreting information on a screen and then moving our cursor or making a few keystrokes based on that that information. AI models have been good at the interpretation part for a couple of years now, but computer use bridges the gap between interpretation and action in a real-world helpful way like no model has before. It’s a little clunky today and for most people the prompts needed to complete a simple task would take longer than actually just doing the task, but you can pretty easily imagine the future when much of the prompting is abstracted away and descendants of computer use are automating much of the knowledge economy’s work.</p><p><span>Fine by me: “Hey computer use, please write and publish this week’s edition of the </span><em>Weekly Dose of Optimism</em><span>.”</span></p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><span>: After writing the above passage, Anthropic </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/124f673f-0a69-4c73-9e3d-366087ec7785?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">added another feature to Claude</a><span>: the ability to write and run code.

It was awesome. A group of my favorite progress thinkers and doers from the internet came to Lighthaven in Berkeley to discuss the question: </span><strong>how do we make more progress?</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>There was a range of talks and topics, but the topic that came up the most was some version of a debate over the 2020 paper by Nicholas Bloom, Chad Jones, John Van Reenen, and Michael Webb, </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e9f9d802-ba21-4cd5-9e7f-4ce39329653a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find</a></em><span>?</span></p><p>If ideas are getting harder to find and if the “low hanging fruit has been picked” – and the authors argue that they are and it has – then it’s unsurprising that we are stagnating. </p><p>Economic growth, they write, is a function of ideas, which is a function of research productivity and number of researchers. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/541f3b1d-e987-4a2f-8234-1e4da6370768?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1496,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41615df-1f5a-4d29-a85d-1cc723782167_748x173.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Bloom et al.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>To determine whether new ideas had indeed become harder to find, they looked at three specific case studies – Moore’s Law, seed yields, and medical innovations – and at the growth of the economy as a whole. </p><p>They found that in all the cases they examined, it’s taken more researchers just to find the same number of ideas over time, which means that ideas are getting harder to find, which implies that we either need to throw an exponentially increasing number of researchers at problems just to maintain our current growth rate (maybe possible with AI!) or settle in for a long stagnation. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d10c9e92-e5f1-4cd4-b00c-397e4649fc6e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d22fbf-4c70-457f-9f29-ea8c93434174_908x588.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Bloom et al. </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I am not an economist, so maybe this is just how these things work, but the whole argument strikes me as incredibly circular: </p><ul><li><p>The paper defines ideas as things that lead to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth.</p></li><li><p>TFP is the portion of economic output growth that cannot be explained by increases in the quantity of inputs (like labor and capital). </p></li><li><p>The paper then measures research productivity as TFP growth divided by research input.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it concludes that because this ratio is declining, ideas are getting harder to find.</p></li></ul><p><strong>By defining ideas in terms of TFP growth, the paper essentially assumes its conclusion.</strong><span> </span></p><p>The paper does provide valuable data on the relationship between research inputs and certain economic outputs over time, and it finds this pattern across various domains, which suggests there's something meaningful happening. And the authors have forgotten more about economics than I’ll ever learn, so maybe I’m missing something. </p><p><strong>The problem is, the paper might actually lead to the </strong><em><strong>wrong</strong></em><strong> conclusion: that we need to throw more researchers at the problem, that we just need to produce more ideas. </strong></p><p><strong>For one thing, it might suggest that now that AI is here, we’re good.</strong><span> While the number of </span><em>human</em><span> researchers won’t be able to scale exponentially to offset declining research productivity, maybe the number of AI researchers can. If you assume that ideas are the bottleneck, then maybe you just hold out for a sufficiently intelligent model. </span></p><p>The question of whether AI would just solve progress came up multiple times at the conference. </p><p><span>The most common response was: no, </span><strong>ideas are not the bottleneck</strong><span>. </span></p><p><strong>On the opposite end of the spectrum, it might suggest that we are really and truly screwed.</strong><span> Total Factor Productivity really has fallen off since the 1970s, and if ideas just keep getting harder to find, and ideas are what drive TFP, then we might just be in for greater and greater stagnation.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7c124321-1982-447f-9de9-a13770504bfc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0220e35-7413-49fe-ae86-894a24ca7bdb_908x511.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Eli Dourado </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Both of these are dangerous but passive. Wait and see. </p><p><strong>A third option, implied but not recommended by the paper, would be to throw more at research: more people, more education, more money. </strong><span>If ideas are getting harder to find – if it takes more “effective researchers” to generate the same number of ideas – then we need to produce more researchers to at least match the rate of decline in research productivity. </span></p><p><span>That strikes me as equivalent to observing that a football team’s yards per carry is declining and deciding that they need to run the ball more to make up for it. To torture this analogy a bit, it’s maybe even more equivalent to signing </span><em>more</em><span> running backs, whoever’s available off waivers, and then running the ball more with </span><em>them</em><span>, instead of fixing your offensive line. Worse, there are only 53 roster spots, so every new running back you sign means cutting someone who could be doing the blocking and tackling!</span></p><p><span>We will always need new ideas. In this house, we subscribe to the David Deutsch </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/23607a4c-3340-4d93-a274-28785b743ef6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Principle of Optimism</a><span>: “All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.” </span></p><p>And to be fair, the paper isn’t trying to suggest that a lack of ideas is solely responsible for the slowdown in TFP growth. It’s simply arguing that the assumption of constant research productivity doesn’t hold up, and it makes its point. </p><p>But the simplistic takeaways – that ideas are getting harder to come by so either we’re doomed, can expect AI to save us, or need to throw more researchers at the problem – are dangerous and, I think, wrong. </p><p>There are plenty of good ideas waiting to be turned into progress. There’s an idea backlog. </p><h3><strong>The Idea Backlog</strong></h3><p>So why are so many companies being built today using ideas from the 1950s and 1960s? </p><p>Let’s look at this chart again: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7c124321-1982-447f-9de9-a13770504bfc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0220e35-7413-49fe-ae86-894a24ca7bdb_908x511.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Eli Dourado </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>One thing that the paper omits is any discussion of why, if research productivity had been declining fairly steadily and the number of effective researchers had been rising fairly steadily since the 1930s, there was such a dramatic fall-off in TFP starting in 1973. </p><p>That is a major omission! If the slowdown in TFP growth can be explained by ideas getting harder to find, why did growth hit a brick wall in 1973 as opposed to slowly decaying as soon as ideas became harder to find? </p><p><span>Well, one question to ask might be “Which factors contributed to TFP growth in the last good decades, the 1950s and 1960s, and when were the </span><strong>ideas</strong><span> for those factors discovered?” </span></p><p>I asked that question, to both Claude and Perplexity, and both cited: Petrochemicals/Plastics, Electronics / Semiconductors, Aviation, Antibiotics / Medical Advances, Mass Production Techniques, all of which were conceived of in the 1920s through 1940s or earlier! </p><p><span>By the time those ideas’ productivity was realized, they were relatively old ideas. As </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9384a90a-d186-4dd7-8277-0547c2625f58?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Perplexity concluded</a><span>, “In conclusion, while the 1950s and 1960s saw remarkable TFP growth, this ‘golden age’ was largely built on technological innovations and research from earlier decades, particularly the 1930s and 1940s.” There was a two decade lag. </span></p><p>So given the TFP fall-off in 1973, it’s not surprising that so many ideas from the 1950s and 1960s are still available to entrepreneurs today. It’s as if they were frozen in amber. </p><p><strong>The question isn’t whether good ideas have gotten harder to find, but why it got so hard to use the good ideas we already generate. </strong></p><p><span>In one of the best talks of the conference, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b71a4d4c-352b-4026-951e-4faeffed7d8b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Eli Dourado</a><span> argued that </span><strong>ideas aren’t getting harder to find; they’re getting harder to </strong><em><strong>use</strong></em><span>, thanks to the three rules put on innovation:</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e6128c48-7f64-45a2-9db9-27d999e906a9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0614e-9278-4001-af65-19225b0e8fd9_908x392.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Eli Dourado</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>This is the precautionary principle ad absurdum.

The challenge isn’t just that they make it hard and expensive to license new reactors, but that they make it illegal to experiment and iterate on new reactor designs. </p><p>Used to be, a man was allowed to fuck around and find out. That’s how progress happened. Edison’s electrical wires electrocuted people. The Wright Brothers faceplanted into the Kitty Hawk sand during test flights. The boilers on Vanderbilt’s steamships occasionally exploded. Then they iterated, improved, even undertook new research to create new and improved ideas to address the obstacles that can only be exposed by interaction with the real world. </p><p><span>Then, Americans’ attitude towards risk shifted. I wrote about this in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f39e4edf-47ad-4a4d-8711-7c5652d3278e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Riskophilia</a></em><span>.

In the DoD’s case, that means reliable power that is easy to transport. </span></p><p><strong>This premium demand is often critical to the development and diffusion of technologies.</strong><span> Certain buyers can support a technology when it’s more expensive than alternatives in the market, which provides an initial push down the cost curve.

At the same time that it became harder and more expensive to test and iterate, two important premium buyers dramatically cut spending. </p><p>Taken together, these factors seem to explain why TFP fell off in 1973 more than the idea that ideas have gotten harder to find. There are more, but these make the point. </p><p>Which brings us back to the question: why are people building things again now? </p><p>Here’s my hypothesis: </p><p>Ideas have gotten more expensive not to discover, but to build, at the same time that demand for premium versions of things slowed their spending. That meant that the initial push down the cost curve never happened, which meant that ideas remained more expensive to implement, which means they never got to the normal part of the demand curve. </p><p>Now, two things are happening. </p><ol><li><p>Technology is making old and new ideas cheaper and easier to build. </p></li><li><p>There’s a reemergence of “premium demand.” </p></li></ol><h3><strong>Ideas Need Adoption to Make an Impact</strong></h3><p><strong>Ideas alone are not enough. They need to be techno-economically viable, buildable for a low enough cost that the market is able to adopt them. There is no progress without adoption. </strong></p><p>Premium demand can help technologies that have a path to market viability reach that point. It’s a bridge. It’s not charity, or even grants. These products offer capabilities that no other products do and for which the government and Big Tech are willing to pay higher prices to access those capabilities. </p><p>Big Tech is buying nuclear power out of its own selfish interests, and the AI it produces may show up in TFP growth, but nuclear power won’t have a large direct impact on TFP while it sits behind the meter powering data centers. That will come as a result of building and manufacturing more reactors and bringing them down the learning curves. Until then, it has powerful, deep-pocketed, and motivated allies to help fight the costly hurdles in its way. </p><p>The same can be said for capabilities that the DoD might buy – whether drones or supersonic planes – which will show up first in the military context and diffuse to consumers as companies scale up manufacturing and bring down costs. NASA and the DoD were the premium demand for SpaceX’s early launch; now, the benefits can be felt by anyone who uses Starlink to access the internet. </p><p>For a certain set of technologies, this bridge is critical. But something else is happening, too. </p><p>Despite the slowdown, technological progress has marched on. Compared to 1973, entrepreneurs have a cornucopia of lower-cost, higher-performance technologies at their disposal with which to build. AI, CRISPR, batteries, solar, software, launch, materials, sensors, and an ever-expanding list of inputs continue to improve and get cheaper. </p><p>Atom Limbs’ AI prosthetic is possible, at a price the market will pay, because of advances in sensors, actuators, batteries, and machine learning. </p><p>Longshot Space uses advanced control systems to inject gas directly behind the projectile as it moves down the barrel at sub-millisecond precision, a capability that Gerald Bull could only have dreamed of. Plus, the DoD is a potential early customer for Longshot’s hypersonic capabilities, which would help fund the development of the ultimate mission of launching mass into space more cheaply and helping humans, and our progress, scale beyond earth. </p><p>Almost any 1950s or 1960s idea that’s being brought back to life today benefits from dramatic cost and performance improvements compared to the technology available at the time. </p><p>Perhaps what’s happening is that those cost declines have outrun the cost increases from regulation and other countervailing forces put up over the past fifty years. More simply: it all comes down to economics. The factors for and against progress can be boiled down to the all-in costs to turn ideas into scaled products, and whether there are enough buyers willing to pay more than that cost. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ad54ad39-32b3-472c-987f-1a567ed6e272?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7041674a-f4e1-4749-ba09-2c26d32f343c_908x591.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Technology and Scale Can Push the Price of Ideas Down to Adoption</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>A counterpoint might be that there’s a lot of economic interest behind scaling Moore’s Law or improving crop yields, and yet, new impactful ideas in those fields are getting harder to find.

The UCC first filed </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2b054941-9b91-47d1-a126-ad676b64cfb9?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">a response</a><span> to the ad hoc group’s motion to dismiss:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“From the jurisprudential vantage point, the Ad Hoc Group’s Motion to Convert/Dismiss is tantamount to another wielding of the Sword of Damocles, this time not over the Board, but over the Court. ‘This Court will,’ says the pleading, ‘allow us to immediately seize the assets, or we will deprive the company of liquidity and place Tupperware’s very existence in jeopardy.’”</em></p></blockquote><p>Alright but so what exactly does the UCC want?</p><blockquote><p><em>“[T]he Committee would prefer referral to mediation and a general pause on these proceedings. In the alternative and in general, however, the Committee supports the use of cash collateral and the bidding and sale process embodied in the Bid Procedures Motion.'“</em></p></blockquote><p>The UCC sees smoke and they believe there’s some fire. Smoke = that pesky bridge loan followed by an abrupt pivot to foreclosure. And fire = a potential violation of Delaware’s implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. That’s right. They’re suggesting there may be grounds to equitably subordinate the ad hoc group’s secured position:</p><blockquote><p><em>“[T]here are three conditions precedent to equitable subordination: (1) the claimant must have engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the misconduct must have resulted in injury to the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair advantage on the claimant, and (3) equitable subordination of the claim must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Again, the Ad Hoc Group’s actions concerning the Bridge Loan followed by an abrupt pivot to an intentionally obfuscating out-of-court foreclosure may support a finding of inequitable conduct, which deprived the Debtors of a market-tested process and alternative financing and transaction options, and resulted directly in these free-fall Chapter 11 filings.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And, of course, the UCC also took issue with the ad hoc group’s credit bidding rights:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Courts find ‘cause’ to limit credit bidding on a case-by-case basis where, generally speaking, secured creditors have obtained an unfair advantage and forced a sale at depressed prices. Courts have found unfair advantage or lender misconduct under circumstances far less suspicious than that established in these cases to date.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Remember that the debtors’ bid procedures motion already contemplates an all-cash bid process so both the debtors and the UCC are on the same page here. Indeed that seems to be the case on most of the issues, but the UCC is prescient, and warned of a future possible betrayal from the debtors:</p><blockquote><p><em>“These cases started with the Debtors and the Ad Hoc Group at loggerheads, continuing their pre-petition dispute as to process. It is not lost on the Committee that the posture of these cases could devolve into a Chapter 11 in name only upon a deal between the Debtors and Ad Hoc Group. If, for instance, a deal between the Debtors and Ad Hoc Group were to be struck such that the practical effect is a strict foreclosure and leaving unsecured creditors holding the bag, the Committee reserves the right to itself pivot, and to support a Chapter 7 liquidation.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Basically, “</span><em>we hate your motion to convert/dismiss but we reserve our right to bring our own motion to convert/dismiss if things go astray.</em><span>” 🙄</span></p><p><span>But back to the credit bidding issue. You’ll recall, the amount of secured claims that the ad hoc group asserts is BIG — like really big. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/da9ef6a1-b9ec-4c05-b1dc-9d1f67e0a843?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">According to the ad hoc group</a><span>, it holds ~$473mm of secured loans (out of the ~$817mm in total outstanding principal). In other words, no third party bidder is going to touch this thing with a 10-foot pole if the ad hoc group is allowed to credit bid the entire thing.</span></p><p><span>Here’s the debtors in </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/89242062-9014-4547-af92-c7199ddea7b6?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">their objection</a><span> to the ad hoc group’s motion to dismiss/convert:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“As with prior marketing efforts, there is significant interest, but the overhang of the Motion and uncertainty regarding the Ad Hoc Group’s right to credit bid have chilled progress in that process, as bidders are understandably hesitant to devote significant resources in the shadow of a potential nine-figure credit bid.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Notably, they reference </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/83f5e6b4-7298-4e62-a870-f611ca39e2f0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">a decision</a><span> by </span><strong>Judge Gross</strong><span> to limit credit bidding in </span><strong>Fisker Auto. Holdings Inc.</strong><span>’s ‘14 chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. But the ad hoc group argued that scenario was different:</span></p><blockquote><p><span> </span><em>“The court, however, did not hinge its ruling on the fact that the claim was purchased at a discount. Rather, cause existed to cap the credit bid according to the Fisker court, because the amount of the allowed claim was uncertain, and the court was concerned that secured creditors would have ‘frozen out’ another interested purchaser by proposing an aggressive timeline.”</em></p><p><em>“In this case, unlike Fisker, the amount of the secured claims of the Prepetition Secured Lenders is clearly defined as a valid, perfected lien on substantially all of the Debtors’ assets, as it has been stipulated to by the Debtors. Further, neither the Ad Hoc Group nor the other Secured Lenders have engaged, or alleged to have engaged, in aggressive tactics or proposed unfair timelines with the aim of freezing out other interested parties. To the contrary, the Ad Hoc Group has sought to work collaboratively with the Debtors to find value optimizing out-of-court solutions to continue the business as a going concern, while the Debtors commenced these cases with a strategy for a 30-day sale process, which is opposed by the Ad Hoc Group and certain other Revolving/Term Loan Secured Lenders.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The ad hoc group obviously has a different idea of what working “collaboratively” means. Does asserting foreclosure pre-petition and actively petitioning the court to dismiss the case constitute “aggressive tactics” (aka inequitable conduct) to freeze out any potential bidder?</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9bd62dd8-d15b-42f3-ae42-530e96b2669f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273e567a-fa90-42eb-a210-8bc1b2da925e_480x266.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But it doesn’t really matter, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9817f8c3-ef2e-470a-a50d-687c990c6846?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">says the debtors</a><span> — the end goal is to promote a value-maximizing auction process that the “lenders” shouldn’t be opposed to since it could very well benefit them as well:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“In fact, prepetition marketing efforts suggest that the proposed sale process—if allowed to play out—could very well provide the Ad Hoc Group with a cash recovery in excess of its investment basis. In this regard, it is far from “irrelevant” that the Ad Hoc Group purchased its debt at a steep discount—if its members were behaving in an economically rational way as lenders (rather than purchasers), they would be supportive of this process, which could provide them with a recovery on top of the economics they have already received in connection with the Bridge Facility.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The “lenders,” according to the debtors, are acting more like predatory loan-to-own bidders at this point (“</span><em>the Ad Hoc Group purchased its debt holdings at somewhere between 4-6% of the debt’s face value</em><span>”). </span></p><p>Okay but what about the extensive prepetition marketing process that yielded little interest?** Obviously, with such a disappointing result, the ad hoc group argues there’s little point in pursuing a postpetition process as well. BUT, the UCC would argue that the prepetition process was flawed. Again, from the UCC’s response:</p><blockquote><p><em>“[The prepetition] process lacked current financial statements (likely an important data point for any potential buyer or financier to make an informed decision) and was cut short following the Ad Hoc Group’s insistence on exclusivity in connection with the Bridge Loan. At the very least, a real process, which includes a business plan, updated financials, and all of the other usual inputs that market participants demand, should be undertaken.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Which current financial statements are we talking about here? Oh maybe it’s the ~1 years worth of 10-Qs and 10-Ks that Tupperware has missed. Tupperware last filed a 10-Q in March ‘24 and it was for 3Q’23 LOL.</p><p><strong>Judge Shannon</strong><span> heard two days worth of witness testimony on October 16 and October 17 and we’re set to have a continued hearing later today, October 22, at 11am ET. Does the credit bid get allowed? Do the cases get dismissed? </span></p><p>We’re on the edge of our seats here too folks.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4df088bb-da76-4e83-ad9a-65af12cd3bbd?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f9a34e9-7ac7-418d-b958-f2dfc0af75ce_480x270.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><h5><span>*You can refer to all our previous coverage </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4191cdcb-74be-4dc5-82d0-f40029aba900?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/18b9decd-6dec-403f-95fa-2332208c6e8a?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/58ce9842-ed40-456d-9fa1-f0785b720551?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/00e0490b-698f-4420-99ea-d40f4bdda1de?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2c23b2b0-cb2c-4b55-b305-963773748c0f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>. </span></h5><h5><span>**According to the ad hoc group, the highest bid received represented than 20% of the outstanding debt.

They have reignited the imagination and ambitions of a generation. </p><p>Nothing quite gets the people going like launching shit into SpaceX, and nobody launches (and now catches) shit into space like SpaceX.</p><p>Your turn… </p><p><em>Ashley Strickland for CNN</em></p><blockquote><p><em>A mission to study one of the solar system’s most promising environments that may be suitable for life has lifted off.

Over the past week, both Amazon and Google signed major nuclear deals, as they look for affordable, clean, and flexible sources of energy to fuel their every growing resource needs.</p><p>First, Amazon has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and announced its investment in SMR maker, X-Energy. Amazon is investing over $500 million to develop SMRs, partnering with Dominion Energy to explore building an SMR near an existing nuclear facility in Virginia, and collaborating with Energy Northwest to construct four advanced SMRs in Washington state. </p><p>Not to be outdone, Google signed a groundbreaking agreement with Kairos Power to purchase energy from a fleet of SMRs to power its AI data centers. The deal involves six to seven SMRs, with the first reactor expected to be operational by 2030 and the rest coming online by 2035, providing a total of 500 megawatts of clean, continuous power.</p><p>SMRs are hot. They are nuclear fission reactors that are significantly smaller and more compact than traditional nuclear power plants, and typically generate up to 300 MWe of electricity. SMRs are designed to be factory-built, easily transported, and installed on-site in modules, offering greater flexibility and lower costs compared to large-scale nuclear plants. </p><p>Amazon and Google may prefer SMRs due to their scalability, reduced capital investment, smaller physical footprint, and enhanced safety features, allowing for easier integration into their existing data center infrastructure.</p><p>That said, both X-Energy and Kairos are planning to build advanced reactors — never before approved by the NRC — using advanced TRISO fuels. Amazon is not one to waste money (Google, maybe, but not Amazon!), so their involvement is both a sign that they believe there’s a path to approval and another set of muscles in the push to get these incredibly safe, potentially cheap reactors approved. </p><p>We are living in a nuclear powered-AI revolution. Imagine saying that sentence just 3 years ago.</p><p><em>From Dario Amodei</em></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>I think that most people are underestimating just how radical the upside of AI could be</strong><span>, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks could be.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Dario Amodei and his company, Anthropic are known for advocating for AI safety and paying particular attention to AI risks and controllability. But he’s no doomer! Anthropic may pay an outsized amount of attention to risks relative to its competitors, but I imagine that Dario and team didn’t just get into this game for risk mitigation — they want to play an important role in building a beautiful future. He believes the risks, while real, are a manageable obstacle on the path to a very positive future.</p><p>Given his relative caution, his optimism is all the more notable. </p><p>In this well-researched and reasoned essay, Amodei suggests that when “powerful AI” occurs (he doesn’t like the term AGI), we may experience a century’s worth of progress in just 5-10 years. He focuses on five key areas where AI could have the most impact:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biology and Physical Health</strong><span>: Advancement in biological research, leading to cures for diseases, extended lifespans, and overall improvements in physical well-being. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Neuroscience and Mental Health</strong><span>: Revolutionize neuroscience by enhancing our understanding of the brain, leading to better treatments for mental illnesses and improved mental health.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Development and Poverty</strong><span>: Boost global economic growth, alleviate poverty, and reduce inequalities between nations.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Peace and Governance</strong><span>: Strengthen democratic institutions and promote peace by improving governance and decision-making processes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Work and Meaning</strong><span>: Redefine the nature of work, offering new forms of meaningful engagement and helping humans find purpose in an AI-augmented world.</span></p></li></ul><p>Hey Dario, shake my hand. We’re aligned.</p><p><em>Diana Kwon for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>In animals, the molecule automatically reduced blood-sugar levels without causing them to dip too much.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7d6eed56-a247-447a-a481-ea15d9848737?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecb1a84-6081-4801-8de4-2e4c3bedf1cd_767x511.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>It feels like every week there’s some new research on diabetes or obesity or some other condition that’s impacted by blood-glucose levels. This week was no different.</p><p>Researches have developed a new form of 'smart' insulin called NNC2215 that can automatically switch its activity on and off based on blood-glucose levels. This insulin molecule is engineered to remain inactive when glucose levels are low and activate when they rise. Essentially, the smart insulin prevents blood-sugar levels from rising, without causing them too drop to dangerous levels. In animal studies, NNC2215 outperformed current insulin treatments.

The COVID-19 pandemic left the Debtors reeling, with the sudden seizure of commercial transportation (other than essential goods and services) driving softness in the commercial vehicle market compounded by long-term elevation in labor and materials costs. During and after the pandemic, operational and business integration challenges at certain non-Debtor affiliates required capital support from the Debtors.</em></p></blockquote><p>Absolutely nothing new here folks. Nor anything original about this either:***</p><blockquote><p><em>Then, as inflation swelled beginning in 2021, the Federal Reserve reacted by raising interest rates to the highest level seen in decades. This sea change in the global macroeconomic environment contributed to a major decrease in demand for imports and finished manufactured goods; this caused a resulting depression in the freight industry and knock-on effects on freight vehicle manufacturing, which comprises an irreplaceable portion of the Debtors’ customer base. On top of these challenges, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resultant sanctions regimes against the Russian Federation, left the Debtors unable to access cash at their non-Debtor Russian affiliate—a business that was otherwise an operational bright spot.</em></p></blockquote><p>It was time to break out the playbook. </p><p><span>The debtors kickstarted an operational restructuring to reduce costs and extend liquidity runway. That’s code for f*cking over vendors. The debtors also started divesting assets. No doubt Mr. Moore was turning over a couch cushion for spare change. Alas, it didn’t matter. By summer ‘24, the debtors had to engage an ad hoc group of consenting first lien lenders and consider strategic alternatives, including a pre-petition sale and marketing process. Enter </span><strong>Perella Weinberg Partners ($PWP)</strong><span>(“PWP”). Given that this sucker is now in bankruptcy, it’s clear that none of the interest was robust enough to make the term lenders happy. Or, as the debtors put it, “</span><em>…the existing bids have not generated sufficient value to present an attractive opportunity to transact.</em><span>” Word salad, anyone? </span></p><p>Let’s talk about that debt. The debtors’ capital structure looks like this:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4ac02d1a-2d0c-47ba-a4eb-b4df6743a5d1?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1146,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2df3d9c3-1142-421e-a39d-ec848f3b0a65_573x441.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 16</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>What you see there, at least with Amendments 14-16, is an awful lot of pre-DIP DIP or “bridge financing” tacked on to the original term loans. Which also explains the proposed DIP in these cases: it is a $103mm headline number but that is comprised of only $30mm of new money and a roll-up of $73mm (which comports with the bridge financing amounts). The amount of cash infused into this business pre-filing suggests another reason for the filing: the ad hoc group of consenting term lenders were sick of shoveling money into this thing without the protections afforded to financings under chapter 11 (read: section 364 super-priority status). The debtors seek the complete roll-up on an interim basis along with $20mm of the new money. Fees include a 5% PIK upfront fee, a 2% exit fee, and certain backstop fees to </span><strong>Jefferies Capital Services LLC</strong><span>, as fronting lender.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/74271edd-b509-4d04-a420-e4ee27262272?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F368106cb-cd7e-42b9-bacd-3f1089893533_480x270.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>Indeed! The DIP also contained an interesting 10% “sale premium” feature in the event that the debtors sell all of their assets (or equity). The premium would apply to both the new money and roll-up amounts so we’re talking roughly $10mm for doing … looks 👉, looks 👈 … not entirely sure, frankly, 🤷‍♀️. We’ll come back to this seeming-backdoor-breakup-fee in a hot sec. </p><p>So, now that this thing is in bankruptcy and we know there’s new money coming in, what are the debtors hoping to achieve while in chapter? </p><p><span>Well, speaking of playbooks, middle market specialist </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span> (“Kirkland”)(😉) is company counsel here.**** And so, in typical Kirkland fashion, we have a restructuring support agreement (“RSA”). The RSA contemplates (i) the ABL revolving facility remaining in place (and riding through the cases)***** and (ii) an equitization of the term loan subject to a sale toggle should any potential buyer come forward offering “</span><em>…sufficient value to present an attractive opportunity to transact.</em><span>” In addition to agreeing to the equitization, the consenting term loan lenders have agreed to a $128mm takeback DIP-to-exit loan ($112mm) which would include $15mm of new money (distributed pursuant to a debt rights offering)(the backstopping DIP lenders also get an equity kicker such that, in the end, they’ll end up with more equity than term lenders who weren’t part of the ad hoc group). </span></p><p>What about general unsecured creditors? Well, here comes their recovery:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ca83705f-5e10-4eda-91f0-6f3a84542d69?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_500,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9d63d2-8fdd-4b11-a307-1c6244e0f8b6_500x281.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>With one catch. The critical vendor motion here is pretty robust; it consists of ~$12mm to be paid on an interim basis and another ~$8mm on a final basis. In other words, its 67% of the new money DIP. </p><p>What’s in line for Crestview’s equity? C’mon now, that’s a trick question fools! Clearly with GUCs getting a big fat 🍩, Crestview stands to as well.****** </p><p>The DIP requires a confirmed plan of reorganization memorializing the terms of the RSA within 95 days of the petition date. </p><p>At a first day hearing held on October 11, 2024, the debtors obtained their requested relief. They did not, however, get approval of that funky sale premium. Indeed, prior to the hearing, the debtors submitted a revised order indicating the following:</p><blockquote><p><em>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Motion, this Interim Order or the DIP Documents, the Exit Fee (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) and the Sale Premium (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) are not being approved pursuant to this Interim Order and shall only be approved in accordance with a Final Order granting such relief. </em></p></blockquote><p>We reckon an official committee of unsecured creditors (“UCC”) may have something to say about it. After all, the UCC isn’t going to have much to work with under this case construct. </p><p><span>As  noted, the debtors are represented by Kirkland as legal counsel (Ryan Blaine Bennett, Alexander McCammon, Derek Hunter) along with </span><strong>Young Conaway Stargatt &amp; Taylor LLP</strong><span> (Joseph Barry, Kenneth Enos, Jared Kochenash, Andrew Mark) as local counsel — a pairing you don’t see everyday. A&amp;M is financial advisor and providing the debtors’ their CRO (the aforementioned Mr. Moore) while PWP (Alexander Svoyskiy) is investment banker. The ad hoc group of term lenders is represented by </span><strong>Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP</strong><span> (Matthew Barr, David Griffiths, F. Gavin Andrews) and </span><strong>Richards Layton &amp; Finger PA </strong><span>(Zachary Shapiro) as legal counsel — which just goes to show that </span><strong>Eaton Vance</strong><span> isn’t in </span><em>every</em><span> single credit on planet earth and </span><strong>Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP</strong><span> doesn’t have 100% market share of ad hoc groups, just 99.9%, 😜. There’s a special committee of the board involved here too, featuring frequent independent director </span><strong>Steven Panagos</strong><span> (formerly of </span><strong>Moelis</strong><span>) and </span><strong>Ted Stenger</strong><span> (formerly of </span><strong>AlixPartners LLP</strong><span> … welcome to the party pal); they’re investigating … like … </span><em>stuff</em><span> (while advised by counsel selected from “</span><em>a slate of law firms acceptable to the Consenting Term Loan Lenders” … </em><span>something that must have those firms who frequently get BoD referrals from Kirkland a little nervous).

(“Webb”), filed petitions against the imports of certain brake drums from the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Türkiye alleging that brake drums from these countries were being sold in the United States at less than full value. The net impact of these petitions on the Debtors’ business remains to be seen. Debtor KIC, LLC, purchases brake drums from certain Chinese manufacturing partners. Antidumping and countervailing duties, if imposed, would significantly increase the cost of Wheel Ends’ imported products. At the same time, Debtor Gunite, LLC may face increased demand for its domestic production capacity for wheel end products. The uncertainty resulting from the outstanding petitions filed by Webb appear to have contributed to discouraging potential acquirers of Wheel Ends from transacting at a price that would be profitable for the Debtors (net of projected wind-down and exit costs).</em></h5></blockquote><h5>****We’re not poking fun at Kirkland here; rather, we’re indirectly providing commentary about where the supermajority of chapter 11 bankruptcy deals are these days. The dearth of volume necessitates a “drop down” of the likes of Kirkland (and A&amp;M) to keep bodies busy and mouths fed.

By ‘15, </span><strong>KKR &amp; Co Inc.</strong><span> bought the business, with the previous owners retaining a minority stake. Maybe by now you’re thinking, “</span><em>is this another PE + brick and mortar horror story?</em><span>” Yes, yes it is. Apparently KKR ran the thing so poorly that the minority equity holders </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/213aa35d-cbd7-4389-b437-026a30a7b0f4?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">sued KKR in September ‘23</a><span>, alleging fraud and gross negligence on the part of the PE firm.</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The complaint outlines a deliberate attempt by the defendants to intentionally make false and material misleading statements through the company's 2019 financials by overstating inventory values in order to conceal the fraud and mismanagement of the company. These actions ultimately led to the company restructuring the plaintiff's equity value to pennies on the dollar.  The plaintiffs have sued for a financial amount of damages to be determined at trial.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>By then KKR had already sold the business to a group of private investors that included </span><strong>Hilco Global</strong><span> (“Hilco”) and </span><strong>Behrens Investment Group</strong><span> (“Behrens”) in May ‘23. Hilco and Behrens didn’t do much better.</span></p><p><span>Here’s CRO, </span><strong>Jeffrey Martin</strong><span>, explaining a supplier issue the debtors faced:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The Company has recently encountered multiple issues with its foundational supplier, Target Brands, Inc. (“Target”). Over the past eighteen (18) months, Target has de-mixed its pallets, divesting its best returns to B-Stock Solutions, Inc., a Company competitor. At the same time, Target has been channeling a deteriorating mix of inventory to the Debtors, while increasing the cost of its pallets. Given Target’s position as the Company’s foundational supplier, the Company lacked the necessary leverage to negotiate or otherwise dispute these increased costs.”</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>eBay Inc.

In stark contrast to the debtors, B-Stock seems to run an extensive online marketplace. Retailers like </span><strong>Target Corp.

We’re sure part of that is due to lower operating expenses on the side of B-Stock.</span></p><p>And here’s Mr. Martin’s unoriginal spiel on the struggles of a brick and mortar business:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Retail companies that have a significant or exclusive brick-and-mortar presence, like the Debtors, bear higher expenses than web-based retailers and are heavily dependent on store traffic, which has decreased significantly as consumers increasingly shop online. Other macro-economic factors have further compounded the problems plaguing retailers. For instance, changes in consumer spending habits have necessitated many retailers to increase promotional activities and discounting, leading to thinner profit margins. Onerous brick-and-mortar lease terms and increased operating costs, during a period of downturn in the retail sector and deep discounting, have intensified retail losses. Indeed, these macro-economic challenges have compelled numerous national retailers to file chapter 11 cases in recent years, including Big Lots, Conn’s, Rue21, Express, and The Body Shop, among others.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Wow, that’s quite a list.

But the exact reason may not be as intuitive as you think.</p><p>A study of nearly 1,000 mice found that while calorie restriction and intermittent fasting led to weight loss and improved metabolism, these factors did not directly correlate with increased lifespan. Instead, mice longevity was more closely linked to traits like immune health, red blood cell function, and genetic resilience to the stress of reduced food intake…meaning the life-extending benefits of calorie restriction are driven by factors beyond just metabolic changes.</p><p>The takeaway: enhancing your resilience and immune function may be more critical for extending lifespan than simply cutting calories. Combine the two: eating less + bolstering your body’s immune system and you might just turn into Bryan Johnson.</p><p><em>Wang et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Solution-processable semiconductors hold promise in enabling applications requiring cost-effective electronics at scale but suffer from low performance limited by defects.

The two-hour pod covered the semiconductor industry from top to bottom: etching specialization all the way up to the geopolitical implications of chip manufacturing. Highly, highly recommend listening. And while I feel a bit smarter on chips after listening, what was made abundantly clear to me was that chips are super, super complex — likely the most complex thing that we humans make — and that neither I, nor anyone in the world, really has a complete understanding of the full-stack. So take my summary of this new chips breakthrough with a grain of salt:</span></p><p>Researchers have created a new semiconductor material called CuIn₅Se₈ that can be produced cheaply and in large quantities. Surprisingly, they improved its performance by deliberately adding and organizing defects inside the material, which actually helps electricity flow more efficiently. Talk about turning a weakness into a strength. This breakthrough overcomes previous limitations of defective materials, enabling the creation of high-performance electronics like faster computer circuits and sharper display screens at a lower cost.</p><p>I’m not exactly sure if and when this material will flow into chip commercialization, but especially after listening to that podcast, I have a newfound appreciation for all of the research and work that goes into chips and the importance of seemingly little breakthroughs like have in pushing the industry forward.</p><p><em>Tim De Chant for TechCrunch</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Zap is taking a unique approach to fusion power known as sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch. Instead of using magnets or lasers to squeeze the plasma, it sends a bolt of electricity through a plasma stream. That current generates a magnetic field that compresses the plasma — the pinch — and ends up with fusion.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a4e29573-713f-4933-b567-5d7e0ca76de3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2048,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6223b6df-acca-4908-819e-1b84757b209c_1024x682.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>Zap Energy announced its $130M Series D funding and unveiled “Century,” a prototype fusion reactor that uses sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch technology to advance toward commercial fusion power. Sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch — that’s a mouthful — sends an electric current through a plasma stream to generate a magnetic field that compresses the plasma—leading to fusion—without the need for the most cutting-edge magnets or highest-powered lasers.

The game selects for people who are smart </span><em>enough</em><span> and can train the most and learn the best.

Mike Szkolka, a teacher quoted in the </span><em>Atlantic</em><span> article, explained that “There's no testing skill that can be related to … </span><em>Can you sit down and read Tolstoy</em><span>? ”, so teachers don’t make kids sit down and read Tolstoy.

He told him how big an impact the book had made on him and asked if he still assigned it. “Oh goodness no,” he replied, as if the question itself were preposterous. “They could never handle it.” </span></p><p>This carries into adult life, naturally, because how could it not? At a time when kids’ brains are most plastic, most able to soak in new ideas and make weird connections, we feed them playbooks.

At least the ports are opening back up! Amidst all of that, as hard as it may be, we think its important to ground yourself in some of the good stuff happening all around us.

New treatments popping up left and right. Most recently, a young woman with type 1 diabetes began producing her own insulin after receiving a transplant of insulin-producing islet cells derived from her own reprogrammed stem cells. This marked the first time someone with type 1 diabetes has been treated using cells extracted and reprogrammed from their own body.</p><p>Using a novel method, researchers turned the woman’s own cells into versatile stem cells. They then “guided” these stem cells to become insulin-producing cells and injected the cells into her abdominal muscles, a new place for such a transplant. Ultimately, her body started producing its own insulin again.</p><p>The procedure demonstrated a potential cure for diabetes without the need for donor tissues or lifelong drugs. Diabetes treatment has come such a long way in just my lifetime, and this seems like it has the potential to cure the disease altogether. </p><p><em>Sara Reardon for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Researchers are hoping to do that now that they have a new map — the most complete for any organism so far — of the brain of a single fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).

No? Good. Because that’s the brain map of a fruit fly. And it’s not just any old brain map — it’s the most complete brain map of any organism ever constructed.</p><p>Researchers have mapped the entire brain of a fruit fly, creating the most complete brain map—or connectome—of any organism to date. The map includes nearly 140,000 neurons and over 54.5 million synapses. It took the team over four years to construct the brain map and during the process, they discovered over 8,000 previously undiscovered types of neurons.</p><p>The map is an unprecedented, detailed resource for how the brain functions. Sure, it’s a fruit fly brain, but this is how this process usually works: the fruit fly is simple, so we map it early, learn a bunch, and then apply those learnings to larger animals, then humans. Scientists have started with fruit flies to study genetics and inheritance, gene mapping and linkage, circadian rhythms, and more. Which is to say, understanding these guys’ little brains could provide new insights on how our big brains work. </p><p><em>From the Department of Energy</em></p><blockquote><p><em>US nuclear capacity has the potential to triple from ~100 GW in 2024 to ~300 GW by 2050.

Just two years ago, nuclear reactors were being shut down in the US. Today, we’re entering into decades long contracts, increasing capacity, and even opening up formerly closed reactors. </p><p>The US Department of Energy released a new report that explains how and why U.S. nuclear capacity is going triple over the next 25 years. The key takeaways are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Nuclear is essential for decarbonization:</strong><span> To reach net-zero emissions, the U.S. needs 700–900 GW of additional clean firm capacity by 2050; nuclear power is a proven option to deliver this scale of carbon-free, reliable electricity alongside renewables.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Existing and new nuclear capacity:</strong><span> Extending the operation of current reactors, uprating their capacity, and building new reactors—especially at existing sites—can significantly expand nuclear capacity.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Overcoming barriers:</strong><span> We need cost-effective new nuclear projects and to learn from past experiences like Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

And, of course, The Biden Administration is also chirping up about their involvement in getting Starlinks live in the disaster zone. But politics aside, it’s pretty amazing how a private company’s sidegig product is now one of the most valuable assets in large scale response efforts, be it the war in Ukraine or Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

We can largely thank GLP1-s for this trend. Americans have been hitting their heads against the wall with new diets and workout routines for decades and have been steadily getting fatter for decades.

The doors were shut before a post even went on Instagram, and like many other people, I am shocked. Annie’s helped me grow into a plant person. Annie’s blog changed my view of buying plants. \"Don’t you think it’s sad that taller varieties, with all their grace, lovely form and charm are being pushed out (and forgotten), only to be replaced with squat, charmless blobs of color?” </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ddf68133-654f-4fc0-8799-3989b3108093?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">Annie wrote 13 years ago</a><span>.  Yes, I do. And this post turned me against the junky breeding strategies represented in your average Home Depot garden center, and made me aware that </span><em>there was another way</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>An ode like this must begin with at least two laments. First, a lament for the other losses in this world. Right now, there are people battling illness, trying to survive brutal wars, and trapped inside famines. It is a privilege to feel a </span><em>loss</em><span> at the closing of a local business. Second, a lament for the employees of Annie’s. Some of them have worked there for a very long time, and all of them that I encountered over the years felt like fellow travelers in this path towards plant understanding. They can’t just go get another job at another Annie’s because there really isn’t another Annie’s. I’m rooting for them all. </span></p><p>But tonight, let me just stay in the feeling of what Annie’s meant to me and what it taught me. </p><p>Every trip to Annie’s felt like a pilgrimage. Up 80, as if a commuter going home, then through a swath of the small city of Richmond, past roadside pupusa stands, a taqueria in every mini-mall, storefront iglesia side-by-side with rock-walled Baptist church. Cross the tracks heading west and you arrived. Plantitas in row after row. </p><p>Few betrayed any hint of what they could become with time and proper care. It was a $6.95 leap of faith every time you dropped one in your cart, based solely on a small picture and a lively description, which crackled with the same bright nerdy energy as a bookseller’s note. At Home Depot, if you go to buy marigolds, the tiny dwarf plants are covered with blossoms. Those flowers came at a cost to the development of the rest of the plant, but they market the product at the point of sale. </p><div><div><div><p>oakland garden club is for people like you.</p></div><div><p><a href=\"https://substack.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.ntnXgztIMldTcRgZXDbvTUcq8xej_5Oadsh0rfUyBBM?&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=subscribe-widget-preamble&amp;utm_content=149790864\"><span>Upgrade to paid</span></a></p></div></div></div><p><span>Annie’s was </span><em>about that plant life</em><span> and they did not pull those tricks. You could buy something 3 inches tall that would turn into a massive plant. But you had to trust the plant, a lesson I learned through the fancy poppies. </span></p><p>I prefer the purpliest blackest reds in the largest sizes. (Don’t judge.) And there are whole lineages of these creatures sold basically only at Annie’s. I took Annie’s advice to get their seedlings what seemed far too early. Like January. So, I braved the blustery foggy winds and loaded my cart with hope for spring. You’re gonna do great, I thought, as I lovingly squeezed each new plant baby and dropped it into its new home on pillows of expensive soil. I love you, I thought, as if kissing a cheek at drop-off, and it was true.</p><p>And then the waiting began.  Each day, I’d putter around to check on them. They were doing well. Green, healthy, happy plants. Week after week. Yes! It was always like that with Annie’s stuff. But I knew that some were supposed to reach 4, 5 feet tall, and for the most part, they were sitting at ground level. Did I detect some thickening in their leaves? I did. They seemed more solid in their homes, if I accidentally smacked them with a hose (sorry!). But they did not grow up.</p><p><span>I won’t say I was frustrated, but I was perplexed. Then, we got that kind of beautiful February weather in California that is a shard of somewhere else’s summer. You know how it goes: People emerge onto porches and turn to face the sun in their shorts, without their hats, soaking in the sun. Vitamin D surges. You walk back inside, screen door smacking, and anyone who touches you can feel the warmth on your skin.</span><sup> </sup></p><p><span>Surely, then, </span><em>that</em><span> weather would be </span><em>the </em><span>signal. Plants are known, really, to take temperature as their primary environmental cue, the phenologists contend. </span></p><p><span>BUT the weather was </span><em>not</em><span> the signal. In some cases, the poppies began to grow upwards, but they did not bloom. It took months, really, all the way into April before any of them did. And then, plants separated by just a few feet took wildly different paths. One poppy spent four whole months growing a stalk sturdy as Iowa corn, put out one impossibly beautiful bloom, and then died. Another turned into a monster, contorting into wild shapes as I tried in vain to keep it somewhat upright. It flowered dozens of times, gorgeous purple blooms that left behind key-lime-sized seed pods.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/270b1c9a-6b9d-4ac7-9222-494b0da1f493?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcbc25c-1f89-4d33-9e0a-abe29534f9fd_5760x3840.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>I was hooked. These Annie’s poppies were dynamic. They were not cookie-cutter Icelandic poppies so genetically entrained that their lives were nearly unalterable. I savored the difference and strangeness and inexplicability, the plasticity and resilience. </p><p>Sure, some of the variation in outcome was the type of poppy. Some of it was their positioning within the yard or the particular drainage or soil conditions or something that happened to a root underground. And that’s the point. When you get right down to it, the world is infinite, the factors that go into any living thing’s time fighting entropy are innumerable, and yet … life proceeds through thresholds and decision points.  To bloom or not to bloom is the question every single day of a flowering plant’s life. Why and when and how does it choose (for this must be the word, right)? Have you ever seen an orchid come back from what was surely death and then create the most perfect specimens your eyes have ever beheld? Honestly, what the hell?</p><p>And we, too, in ourselves and through our institutions, are trying to live. Annie’s has closed up shop, for now, though the nursery’s somewhat inscrutable announcement portends that perhaps there will be some future. We all have to figure out when to grow, when to bloom, when to close. We don’t make these decisions unconstrained and sometimes the environment determines our fate. </p><p>But man, let me tell you. Annie’s has got to come back in some form. </p><p>Some local businesses are worth so much more to a community than their revenue numbers could ever show. I don’t know how to protect these places. I don’t think they are easily replaced. I worry the mechanisms of internet business are making them more precarious. But my years won’t be the same without Annie’s, without those sacred trips to the seedlings, without the knowledge and care of the people who worked there. I wish I’d had the chance to help them keep the doors open. </p></div>",

There was something arguably worse: the </span><em>crack spread. </em></p><p>Crack spreads measure the difference between the cost of crude oil and the price of refined gasoline; refiners use it as a back-of-the-envelope method to guesstimate the profitability of a given refinery configuration. The debtors use the “2-1-1” spread, which measures the cost of two barrels of crude oil against the price of a barrel of diesel and the price of a barrel of gasoline. The spread has gone drastically against the debtors over the past several years: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6d72c62e-ea18-4158-a640-24109bd56828?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1696,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93da5198-0cdc-4595-aa37-d16b12ddf6be_848x632.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 18</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>This explains the ugliness of the Mobile refinery’s gross profit in 2Q‘24, reported on August 8, 2024: $6.4mm compared to $37.5mm in Q1’24. As a reminder, that was </span><em>conventional</em><span> production. The absence of </span><em>renewable</em><span> production brought woes of its own. </span></p><p><span>The Federal government looks dimly upon those refiners unable to produce their assigned quota of renewables under the Federal RFS, or “renewable fuel standard” program (the “Program”). The Program requires refiners “</span><em>to blend a minimum amount of on-road transportation biofuels, such as gasoline mixtures that incorporate renewable products like ethanol,” </em><span>Bullock writes. Should refiners fail to produce the volumes required by the EPA, they will </span><em>“accrue monetary obligations payable to the federal government.” </em></p><p><span>The EPA sets renewable volumes annually, based on factors including </span><em>“current climate change policy” </em><span>and air quality. Uh oh: </span><em>“Just as Vertex and the rest of the private sector responded to the sharp increase in biofuel demand, so too did the EPA—the Agency saw the moment as an opportunity to increase the renewable volume obligations even more to encourage even faster adoption of renewable fuels.”</em><span> Never let a crisis go to waste, after all. The EPA demanded an additional 120mm gallons in ‘23, </span><em>“which required fuel refiners like Vertex to blend nearly 21 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2023 and 21.5 billion gallons in 2024.” </em><span>The debtors were unable to meet their obligations, as a result of which $72.5mm of</span><em> “monetary obligations payable to the federal government”</em><span> will</span><em> “accrue”</em><span> by Q1‘25. Ironically, even if the debtors </span><em>had</em><span> produced the required volumes, they would not have been as profitable as they’d hoped. Why not? Because the debtors were not the only ones to think of </span><em>“pivoting” </em><span>to biodiesel in ‘20; there’s now a supply glut. </span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Thus, in 2023, the Company faced a ‘perfect storm’ made up of the looming renewable volume obligations, a shell of a Hydrogen Facility, unstable crack spreads, and a surplus of renewable energy supply in the market. Simply put, the rich renewables market that the Company once projected and planned for was slipping away just as crack spreads more generally were compressing.” </em></p></blockquote><p><span>The debtors explored asset sales, including the renewable diesel segment at Mobile. </span><em>“No actionable transactions materialized,</em><span>” which is hardly surprising.</span></p><p><span>We mentioned Q2 earnings and the disastrous plunge in refinery gross profits.

They reiterated the </span><em>“pause and pivot,”</em><span> and confirmed they are on-schedule for the conversion of the renewable diesel unit back to conventional production. </span></p><p><strong>CEO Benjamin P. Cowart</strong><span> said in the same release that the debtors were continuing to explore strategic options. He announced the appointment of Bullock as CRO. </span><em>“We believe that continued support from our lenders is key to executing our strategic priorities which are focused on managing our liquidity position.” </em></p><p><span>The lenders have been helpful.

GUCs like Matheson, however, had better hope there’s a deep-pocketed buyer. The only way they get a recovery is if there’s “Excess Distributable Cash” from a sale that clears the DIP and term loan. </p><p><span>So what happens if there is no sale process? The debtors will pivot to a recapitalization transaction. This basically means that the term loan will be equitized. Bullock says, should the debtors choose the recapitalization, “</span><em>there are a number of key issues that they will need to address during this process.” </em><span>Top of the list is (i) the $72.3mm owed the Federal government under the Program, (ii) negotiating an amended intermediation facility and/or (iii) sourcing exit financing. You know what Matheson gets under this scenario? A big fat 🍩. At least the consenting lenders agreed to a wind-down reserve though to help get this sucker to a plan of liquidation! Magnanimous!! </span></p><p><span>There’s another component to the RSA that </span><em>is</em><span> a bit more definitive: a DIP credit facility. Indeed, the debtors seek to fund the cases via the use of their lenders’ cash collateral and a $280mm super-senior secured DIP facility committed to by the consenting lenders, comprising $80mm of new money term loans bearing interest at S+950bps and a roll-up of certain pre-petition loans. Of the new money, approximately $39.4mm will be available on an interim basis and $40.6m on a final basis. Regarding the roll-ups, $37.9mm of 2024-1 Term Loans will be rolled into the DIP facility on an interim basis. On entry of a final DIP order, $135.2mm of initial term loans or additional term loans (“restricted roll-up”) and $26.8mm of 2023 term loans (“final roll-up”) will roll up. All will be on a pari passu basis, with the initial and final roll-ups bearing interest of S+940bps and the restricted roll-ups S+960. The “Maximum Roll-Up Ratio” of DIP Roll-Up Loans to DIP New Money Loans will not be greater than 2.5:1 in the aggregate. The facility bears a 3% commitment fee and a 3% closing fee.</span></p><p><span>The debtors won interim approval of the DIP at the first day hearing held on September 25, 2024; they also received authorization for the use of an </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/57a226eb-be97-4828-85b1-8541780a1127?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">amended intermediation facility</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/14032c6f-fdf3-4563-956b-faa28aa046d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">amended hedging agreements</a><span> — both with </span><strong>Macquarie Bank Limited</strong><span> (“Macquarie”) –used to finance purchases of crude oil and feedstocks.
