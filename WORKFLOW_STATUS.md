# Git-First Workflow Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Git-First Workflow System

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: Ready for Use  

### What's Implemented

1. **`scripts/git_workflow.py`** - Auto-commit system with 20-minute timer
2. **`scripts/git_safety.py`** - Pre-work safety checks
3. **`scripts/execute_task.py`** - Task execution with auto-commit
4. **`scripts/README_GIT_WORKFLOW.md`** - Complete documentation

### Current Challenge

- Large file (venv) in Git history preventing GitHub push
- All workflow scripts are ready and tested locally
- Need to resolve Git history issue to enable remote backup

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Resolve Git History**: Remove venv from history completely
2. **Push Workflow**: Get workflow system to GitHub
3. **Begin Using**: Start 20-minute commit cycle immediately

## NEW WORKFLOW ACTIVE

From this point forward:
- ✅ Auto-commit every 15-20 minutes maximum
- ✅ Safety checks before work
- ✅ Timer reminders active
- ✅ Never lose more than 20 minutes of work

## Usage

```bash
# Safety check
python scripts/git_safety.py

# Start timer (separate terminal)
python scripts/git_workflow.py timer

# Execute tasks
python scripts/execute_task.py [task_id]
```
