Everyone has their method for making grilled cheese sandwiches: Some add bacon, or an egg, or greens. Some smear mayonnaise on the bread, others butter. You may like yours with tomato soup, you may like it eaten standing up at midnight. Any which way you go about your grilled cheese, everyone's hoping for the same thing: toasty bread and melty cheese. Sometimes, though, that's not as easy as it sounds: The toast burns before the cheese melts, or the bread is perfectly golden and the cheese is still, sadly, cold.

A so-so grilled cheese sandwich can be devastating, because a good one is the comfiest comfort food around. Here are 10 of the best:
