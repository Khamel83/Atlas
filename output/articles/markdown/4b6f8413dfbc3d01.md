## Selected Content

Unfussy and super elegant in appearance. Full of good tips and ideas, but never condescending (or uppity!). High-reward for not too much work involved, but occasionally ambitious. These are the things we would have guessed you'd want from our articles about home and design, and we were right.

Below are our fifteen most popular home posts of 2016—featuring bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, and of course kitchens and their accessories—and some thoughts on what we learned from seeing you love them.

A Duvet Cover Hack We're Stealing from Hotel Bedding

A Duvet Cover Hack We're Stealing from Hotel Bedding
by Alex Kalita

Instead of using a duvet cover (which can be ornery to take off and put on every time you go to wash it, not to mention expensive) try layering two flat sheets on either side of your comforter. Then, the trick: a smart way to fold the top section so it's nice and tidy (there's a little gif in the post to show you how). Same look, less hassle.

What we learned: All those things that annoy us about keeping up a pretty home? They bug you, too—so it's worth finding a better way.

The cuddly sheets we used to shoot it, and some more hotel-inspired design tricks:

3 Decorating "Tricks" So Transformative You Can Think of Them as Rules
by Amanda Sims

"Tricks," because once upon a time not too long ago the idea of hanging your curtains closer to the ceiling was not a thing—someone gave it a whirl, the move caught fire as a trend, and suddenly it's Interior Design 101.

A DIY Tiny Bathroom Renovation: Before, "Almost-After" & Tips
