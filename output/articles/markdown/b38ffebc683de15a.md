Gigafactories. Starbases. The guy knows how to scale production. </p><p>SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink dish factory in Bastrop, Texas is already producing 15,000 units per day or about 5.5 million per year. And that facility is more than doubling, is being built out from from 700K sqft to 1.7M sqft. Estimated capacity will be about 30,000 units per day or 11M units per year.</p><p>The company already has about 5M Starlink users and estimated revenues above $5B. I don‚Äôt think demand is going anywhere ‚Äî these things are only going to get cheaper, faster, and smaller. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine a world in which everyone in the country owns a couple of Starlinks and is paying $100 per month for fast, reliable internet access, wherever they are.

In doing so, Colossal demonstrated its ability to reintroduce extinct traits using CRISPR gene editing. With the gene editing processes now validated, the next step is to move from mice to elephants, which as you might imagine is a much more complex process.

The study found that as female brains age, some previously silent genes on the inactive X chromosome "wake up" in the hippocampus, a key memory region. One of these genes, </span><em>Plp1</em><span>, plays a role in maintaining myelin, which helps brain cells communicate efficiently. When researchers boosted </span><em>Plp1</em><span> in aging male mice, their memory and cognition improved, and female mice given extra </span><em>Plp1</em><span> performed even better.</span></p><p>This discovery sheds light on why women tend to have better cognitive resilience as they age and opens the door to potential new treatments for age-related memory decline. This new understanding of the X chromosome could lead to breakthroughs in neurodegenerative treatments like Alzheimers and/or lead to the development of brainer boosters to key genes to keep minds sharper and healthier.</p><p><em><span>Kirtane et al in Nature via </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/7b1be4bb-90e6-4670-a501-4bd090800596?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">InterIntellectus on X</a><span> </span></em></p><blockquote><p><em>Patients undergoing radiation therapy experience debilitating side effects because of toxicity arising from radiation-induced DNA strand breaks in normal peritumoural cells.
