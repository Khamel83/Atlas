Dr. Viault’s red blood cells, which ferry oxygen, had surged 42 percent. He had discovered a mysterious power of the human body: When it needs more of these crucial cells, it can make them on demand.</p><p>In the early 1900s, scientists theorized that a hormone was the cause. They called the theoretical hormone erythropoietin, or “red maker” in Greek. Seven decades later, researchers found actual erythropoietin after filtering <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/eugene-goldwasser-biochemist-behind-blockbuster-anemia-drug-1922-2010">670 gallons of urine</a>.</p><p>And about 50 years after that, biologists in Israel announced they had found a rare kidney cell that makes the hormone when oxygen drops too low. It’s called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02314-7">the Norn cell</a>, named after the Norse deities who were believed to control human fate.</p><p>It took humans 134 years to discover Norn cells. Last summer, computers in California discovered them on their own in just six weeks.</p><p>The discovery came about when researchers at Stanford programmed the computers to teach themselves biology. The computers ran an artificial intelligence program similar to ChatGPT, the popular bot that became fluent with language after training on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html?searchResultPosition=1">billions of pieces of text</a> from the internet. But the Stanford researchers trained their computers on raw data about millions of real cells and their chemical and genetic makeup.</p><p>The researchers did not tell the computers what these measurements meant. They did not explain that different kinds of cells have different biochemical profiles. They did not define which cells catch light in our eyes, for example, or which ones make antibodies.</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.</p><p>Already a subscriber? <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?response_type=cookie&amp;client_id=vi&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F03%2F10%2Fscience%2Fai-learning-biology.html&amp;asset=opttrunc">Log in</a>.</p><p>Want all of The Times? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=89WYR&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F03%2F10%2Fscience%2Fai-learning-biology.html">Subscribe</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article>
