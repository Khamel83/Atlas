Some issuers were also simultaneously facing weakening operational performance from lower demand for their services or lower-than-expected growth. This was the case for Digital Media Solutions, New Constellis and Pretium Packaging. Rising competition, inconsistent or weakening demand and the industry’s destocking headwinds in 2023 played a key role in the deterioration of operating performance for Polar US Borrower, LLC (CCC) and ASP Unifrax Holdings, Inc.

With financial conditions easing, and the US Federal Reserve cutting rates for the first time since 2020 during the period, the tally of these at-risk issuers tracked by LCD fell to 136 as of Sept. 30, down from 154 in Q2 and a post-pandemic high of 183 at the end of 2023.”</code></pre><p>They include this handy chart:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e78393f3-116b-4344-9339-7b93e352570f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_496,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F201653e7-6190-4866-9890-5f97736d9b45_496x355.png"></a></figure></div><p><span>One deal that didn’t get done? </span><strong>Exactech Inc.</strong><span> The manufacturer and seller of medical implant devices that may or may not have caused thousands of people some serious medical problems was the lone constituent of the </span><strong>Morningstar LSTA US Leveraged Loan Index</strong><span> to default this past week.
