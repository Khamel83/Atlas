# Lie-Flat Business-Class Flights for Only 10,750 Membership Rewards Points The Points Guy

**Source:** [https://thepointsguy.com/2017/07/business-class-for-10750-mr-points/](https://thepointsguy.com/2017/07/business-class-for-10750-mr-points/)  
**Folders:** Feedly  
**Description:** After British Airways devalued its program to eliminate 4,500-mile short-haul flights in the US, many US-based travelers wrote off the Avios program. There are still plenty of frustrations with the program — from fuel surcharges on British Airways-operated flights to connecting flights pricing separately. However, there have been a few nice changes recently that open an incredible sweet spot.

Last year, American Airlines changed its domestic first-class coding from F (first class) to J (business class). This changed nothing for AAdvantage awards, but this change halved the price of American Airlines-operated flights when using Avios. Last week, American Express improved the standard transfer rate from Membership Rewards to Avios to 1:1. If that wasn’t good enough, Amex and BA just launched a 40% transfer bonus.

Now, you’ll get 75% more Avios when transferring Membership Rewards than you would if you transferred them a week ago, and American Airlines domestic first-class flights are 50% less than a year ago. That means your Membership Rewards take you 3.5x further on AA domestic first-class flights than just nine months ago! The same sub-1,151 mile nonstop domestic first-class flight that would’ve required 37,500 Membership Rewards a year ago now costs just 10,750 points today — that means you can book several round-trips with the sign-up bonuses available with The Platinum Card from American Express or The Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN.

How about celebrating by flying in a lie-flat business-class product? While American has a frustratingly inconsistent fleet, it also has some of the best business-class seats in the skies on some aircraft. And, some of these are flown domestically on a somewhat consistent schedule. Now, with the transfer bonus running through September 17, you can try out one of these products for just 15,000 Avios — which you can get for just 10,750 transferred Membership Rewards (as transfers must be in increments of 250 points).

Let’s take a look at the routes you can do this on.

American Airlines’ 777-200 is so complicated that it takes an entire article to explain it. However, there are essentially just two business-class seat options. Both are lie-flat, but one is significantly more spacious and stable than the other. However, either one would be a huge improvement from standard domestic first-class products you’d find on other AAircraft.

Boeing 767-300

While this business-class seat isn’t winning any awards internationally, the seat does lie flat, and it’s a huge upgrade from standard domestic first-class products.

Here are the routes and flights — starting from the nearly three-hour flight between Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA) down to the two-hour flights between Charlotte (CLT) and MIA.

Airbus A330

AA’s mini-fleet of A330-200s is going to be cycled through the shop soon for a retrofit process, to add true Main Cabin Extra seating and a Premium Economy section. While the business-class cabin is being retained as is, the Envoy seats are a solid mid-tier and they lie flat. While there aren’t many domestic A330 flights, there’s one reliable one:

But What About Award Availability?

American Airlines has become known for having AAtrocious AAward AAvailability recently, but I’m finding a decent amount of award availability of some of these flights. The availability is helped by the sheer number of business-class seats on these aircraft (some have 45). Remember to use the best techniques when searching to save yourself time and hassle.

Here’s one 777-200 flight from Dallas/Forth Worth (DFW) to Miami (MIA) with seven business-class award seats available. Even better, a hot dinner is served on this flight.

Bottom Line

While it’s a lot more fun to fly these lie-flat business-class products overseas, it’s also nice to try them out on domestic routes. In addition to the extra space, I’ve found the catering to generally be better on these internationally configured aircraft. If you’re flying between one of the cities below, check to see if you can try out one of these aircraft for yourself using less than 11,000 Membership Rewards.

This transfer bonus amplifies all kinds of sweet spots in the Avios award chart, and this week we are going to dive into the best of these sweet spots.</p><p>Today, let's focus on how you can fly AA's best international business class products domestically for just 12,000 Membership Rewards points in each direction.</p><h2>The Sweet Spot</h2><p>Here's how this sweet spot breaks down: American Airlines <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2016/11/avios-rates-aa-domestic-first-class-dropped-50-percent/">codes its "domestic first class" seats as business class</a>. Even after the recent <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/here-is-the-official-new-british-airways-avios-partner-award-chart/">BA award chart devaluation</a>, it only costs 16,500 British Airways Avios for nonstop business class awards on flights less than 1,151 miles.</p><p>But, it gets sweeter: AA sometimes flies its <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/fly-aa-best-biz-seats-domestically/">internationally-configured aircraft on domestic flights</a>. With the 40% transfer bonus from Membership Rewards to British Airways Avios, you only have to transfer 12,000 MR points to BA to book these award flights.</p><p>Finding nonstop award availability can be tough on American Airlines flights, especially since AA made some <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/12/aa-irritating-more-award-availability/">annoying changes to how it releases award availability</a> in late 2017. However, it's far from impossible to find award space — and flights on these premium-heavy widebody aircraft usually end up having more award availability than on domestic aircraft.</p><p>The problem is, the schedules for these internationally-configured aircraft on domestic routes vary from month to month. So, we here at <em>The Points Guy</em> dig into AA's schedule regularly to <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/fly-aa-best-biz-seats-domestically/">unveil where you can find these excellent seats</a>.

Top choices are the Citi Prestige ($500 per passenger for 6+ hour delay), the Chase Sapphire Reserve ($500 per ticket for 6+ hour or overnight delay), Chase Sapphire Preferred Card ($500 per ticket for 12+ hour or overnight delay) and the  Citi Premier® Card (12+ hour delay).</p><h2>Earning Points</h2><p>Since this transfer bonus only runs for two months, the promotion is going to be best for those who already have Membership Rewards points in the bank. But if you don't have points in your Amex account — or want to resupply after taking advantage of this deal — here are three great credit card welcome bonuses that are currently available:</p><ul><li>The Platinum Card® from American Express: 100,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $6,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership (also <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/feed-card/cardmatch-246411348/?tid=post">check the CardMatch tool</a> for a possible targeted 125,000-point bonus; targeted offer subject to change at anytime). Terms Apply.</li><li>The Business Platinum Card® from American Express: Earn 120,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $15,000 on eligible purchases with the Business Platinum Card within the first 3 months of Card Membership. Terms Apply.</li><li>American Express® Gold Card: 60,000-point welcome bonus for spending $4,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Terms Apply.</li></ul><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>While it's a lot more fun to fly these lie-flat business-class products overseas, it's also nice to try them out on domestic routes. In addition to the extra space, I've found the food and drink to generally be better on these internationally configured aircraft. So if you're flying between one of the cities above, check to see if you can try out one of these aircraft for yourself using just 12,000 Membership Rewards.</p></div>
