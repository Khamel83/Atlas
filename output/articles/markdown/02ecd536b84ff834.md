A team of researchers investigated how solar could help satiate the ever-growing energy appetites of the hyperscalers. Here’s what they came up with.</p><p>Off-grid solar microgrids offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional grid expansions or fossil fuel plants. An off-grid solar microgrid is a self-contained energy system that uses solar panels and battery storage to generate and supply electricity independently of the main power grid.</p><p>By leveraging abundant solar resources, particularly in the U.S. Southwest, this approach could unlock over 1,200 GW of datacenter capacity. Right now, these data centers are largely reliant on fossil fuels, but over time, the combination of solar, nuclear, and perhaps even fusion will cleanly, affordably, and reliably step in to fill the needs of the hyperscaler’s AI ambitions.</p><p><em>Degenhardt et al in Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Here we report holistic RNA structure determination method using atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks (HORNET), a novel method for determining three-dimensional topological structures of RNA using atomic force microscopy images of individual molecules in solution. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy, this method is ideal for capturing structures of large RNA molecules in distinct conformations. In addition to six benchmark cases, we demonstrate the utility of HORNET by determining multiple heterogeneous structures of RNase P RNA and the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>A research team from the National Cancer Institute and the NIH introduced </span><strong>HORNET</strong><span>, a groundbreaking method that uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) and AI to map the 3D structures of RNA molecules. Unlike traditional techniques, HORNET excels at analyzing RNA molecules that constantly shift shape, capturing detailed images of their flexible structures.</span></p><p>HORNET uses AFM to capture high-resolution images of individual RNA molecules in solution, then applies AI to sort potential structures and a neural network to evaluate their accuracy. This process produces detailed 3D models of RNA conformations, even for highly dynamic and heterogeneous molecules.</p><p>HORNET helps scientists see the 3D shapes of RNA, which is like the tiny instructions inside our cells. More simply, HORNET makes studing RNA easier — which could lead to better treatments and medicines, for diseases like cancer and HIV.</p><p><span>(4) </span><strong>Astranis Satellite Launch</strong></p><p><em>From Astranis</em></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/26fbc25c-d50d-42a8-803c-ed2f5d34afc8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/0jNpyU-y-eU"></a><p>Astranis just launched (or is about to launch…depending on when you read this) four MicroGEO communications satellites aboard a dedicated SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket into a supersync Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). The satellites, serving customers across three countries, include NuView Alpha and Bravo for U.S.-based Anuvu, AGILA for the Philippines, and UtilitySat, a multi-mission satellite initially supporting APCO over Mexico. This marks the first time a single manufacturer has launched four satellites to GEO on one mission.</p><p>We’ve covered Astranis a couple of times, but as a reminder it’s a satellite internet company focused on providing affordable, reliable broadband to underserved regions (such as the Phillipines) by deploying small, geostationary satellites. Unlike large-scale satellite constellations like SpaceX's Starlink, Astranis uses compact, cost-efficient satellites stationed in geostationary orbit, enabling focused coverage over specific areas with a fraction of the cost and infrastructure. This targeted approach allows for quicker deployment and tailored service to regions with limited connectivity.</p><p>We’re rooting for team Astranis — not only because our absolute BOYS Christian Keil and Jason Carman work(ed) there — but because if they’re successful it means millions of more people around the world will have access to fast, reliable, and affordable internet.</p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ef53bd7e-f923-44ec-9170-4d4a72eaac95?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/On3SXnMe5bI"></a><p>From one set of technology brothers to another…well done with this one, gentlemen!</p><p><span>Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen (and been a part of) the rise of </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/046407da-f112-4a95-bf38-fa426d0329a5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">techno-optimistic media</a><span>.

The quick summary is: top AI companies are growing 2x faster than peers, early-stage startups are prioritizing lean growth with reduced headcounts, and later-stage firms are balancing headcount rebounds with revenue efficiency. Despite shrinking cash balances, startups have maintained consistent runway levels by adjusting burn rates based on market conditions. Growth &amp; resiliency, baby. Love to see it.
