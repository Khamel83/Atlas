The 2016 edition of Mary Meeker’s annual Internet Trends report covers today’s Internet growth and an in-depth look at the following:

Global Internet users have surpassed 3B; India has supplanted the US as the world’s second-largest Internet market.

Internet user growth remains consistent (led by acceleration in India), while smartphone user and shipment growth have slowed.

In the face of a slowing global economy, key macro growth drivers from the past 2 decades are less certain.

Internet advertising (particularly via mobile) continues to grow, but so does ad-blocking, pushing the envelope on development of more innovative ad formats.

New online-first brands have rapidly grown in popularity for the millennial generation with their focus on omni-channel and personalized distribution strategies.

In communication, video and images shared are growing as a means of storytelling; creators, consumers, and advertisers are taking part.

Messaging has evolved from simple, expressive conversation to business-focused use cases, with Asian platforms often leading the way.

More efficient and often more convenient than typing, voice-based interfaces are ramping quickly and creating a new paradigm for human-computer interaction.

Transportation is being re-imagined, as the rise of car computerization, autonomous driving, and sharing transform our understanding of mobility.

Looking to China, Internet leadership continues, as the country boasts global innovation powerhouses in e-commerce, messaging, travel, financial services, and on-demand transportation.

The proliferation of data generated by a multitude of devices has fostered tremendous business opportunity, but privacy concerns abound.
