A neutrino is a tiny, nearly invisible particle that passes through almost everything without interacting. The discovery was made when KM3NeT, still under construction, detected a muon‚Äîa secondary particle created by a neutrino hitting nearby rock or seawater‚Äîleaving a bright trail in the detector. This confirms that ultra-high-energy neutrinos exist and opens a new window into the most extreme environments in the universe.</p><p>Scientists believe this neutrino could have been generated by a powerful cosmic accelerator, such as a supermassive black hole or a gamma-ray burst, or it might be a rare "cosmogenic" neutrino linked to the Big Bang‚Äôs remnants. Or more simply put, scientists don‚Äôt yet know how this neutrino was generated. The finding challenges current models and suggests more undiscovered high-energy particles could be out there. As KM3NeT expands, researchers hope to pinpoint the neutrino‚Äôs origin and uncover new cosmic secrets.</p><p><em>Mira et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Montoya Mira et al. designed a rapid, noninvasive assay based on a fluorescently labeled protease-sensitive peptide coupled to a magnetic nanosensor to detect protease activity from a small sample of blood. The assay, termed ‚ÄúPAC-MANN-1,‚Äù was optimized to detect all stages of PDAC with better performance than the clinical biomarker CA 19-9.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ecd775c0-e89e-4460-b7af-86614ceeb0a8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5dd511d-e24c-4445-86e6-116efbe1d145_767x511.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p><span>Call this test PAC-MANN Jones, because it‚Äôs providing shutdown coverage of pancreatic cancer. </span><em>(This was not a crossover I ever anticipated).</em></p><p>Researchers developed a blood test, called PAC-MANN, that detects pancreatic cancer (PDAC) by measuring specific enzyme activity in the blood. The test, using nanosensors, identifies a cancer-associated protease with high accuracy, distinguishing PDAC from both healthy individuals and those with other pancreatic diseases. </p><p>In a study of 356 patients, the test showed 98% specificity and 73% sensitivity, with improved performance when combined with the existing CA 19-9 biomarker. As we‚Äôve talked about before, early detection is the closest thing we have to a cure for cancer. And PAC-MANN‚Äôs ability to provide early detection of PDAC could mean significantly higher survival rates.</p><p><em>Denver Rayburn</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Today, we stand at another such moment. Intelligence, automation, and cheap abundant energy are converging to rewrite the economics of production. Beyond industrial or trade policy, something more profound is changing: the underlying cost physics of manufacturing (coined with inspiration from </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5e9aacbd-deff-4d27-873e-04cc88784a48?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Coogan‚Äôs Law</a><span>.) And unlike previous technological revolutions, this transformation may be permanent ‚Äì creating a lasting shift that uniquely favors American manufacturing.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>America‚Äôs role in the world has changed many times in its history.</p><p>Hell, America‚Äôs role in the world has changed many times over the last 6 weeks.</p><p>More and more folks believe that America once again has to, and can, take on its role of the manufacturing powerhouse it once was. Denver Rayburn, in this excellent primer, lays out his thinking on how America may be favorably positioned to take on that role once again.</p><p>Rayburn argues that the convergence of AI, automation, and cheap energy is permanently reshaping manufacturing economics and eliminating the labor cost arbitrage that drove manufacturing out of the U.S. in the first place. In a world where labor cost is no longer the primary input cost, a country that has abundant and cheap energy, the capital markets to finance an automation rollout, and is a leader in artificial intelligence finds itself in a very strong position. Thankfully, the U.S. checks all of those boxes.</p><p>It‚Äôs kind of scary to think how much of U.S. foreign and domestic policy really hinges on a) whether or not this transition is actually underway and b) how well positioned the U.S. is in this transition. Let‚Äôs hope Rayburn is right and that both the government and private sector take advantage of this unique opportunity in history to rebuild America as a manufacturing hub.</p><p><em>By Reuters</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Palmer Luckey-founded defense tech startup Anduril will take over the development and production of Microsoft's mixed-reality headset program for the U.S. Army, the companies said on Tuesday.

IVAS is a military AR/VR headset designed to enhance soldiers' situational awareness, decision-making, and battlefield effectiveness. An AR/VR headset for the military‚Ä¶Palmer Luckey was born to win this contract.</p><p>Some specifics on the deal: Anduril is taking over production, hardware and software development, and delivery timelines for the program from Microsoft. Microsoft Azure will remain the preferred cloud provider for IVAS and Anduril‚Äôs AI-driven defense technologies. The total IVAS contract is worth $22B over a ten year period and in 2025 the Army requested $255 million of that budget to procure 3,162 IVAS systems.</p><p>This is another massive win for Anudril, which has been on absolute tear as of late. Mega factories, mega rounds, mega contracts, etc, etc. We believe Anduril being on an absolute tear is a good thing not only for Anduril, and the military, and the American people, but for the entire world. Peace through strength. And increasingly, no company is contributing more to the velocity of our nation‚Äôs strength than Anduril.</p><p><em>Elizabeth Gibney for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>QuEra, an academic spin-out company that uses atoms and lasers to encode quantum bits or ‚Äòqubits‚Äô, announced on 11 February that it has raised US$230 million in funding ‚Äî one of the largest single investments in any quantum firm so far.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/8eaa8662-b268-4b43-9315-dd93d732a900?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d6a560-3cf7-4cc1-8b78-4e06b699f912_767x491.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>QuEra, a Harvard and MIT spin-out, has raised $230 million‚Äîone of the largest single investments in a quantum company‚Äîsignaling neutral atom quantum computing as a major player in the field. Neutral atom quantum computing traps rubidium atoms with lasers and encodes quantum information in their electron energy levels, offering scalable and stable qubits without the need for extreme cooling. This approach has historically failed at precisely controlling atoms, but a 2019 breakthrough in laser-based techniques has significantly improved accuracy.</p><p>Practical quantum computing requires tens of thousands of qubits to reach utility, and we‚Äôre still a ways off from that. But with major companies like Google and IBM investing billions into R&amp;D and a wave of newly funded startups introducing novel architectures, the race for quantum is heating up. As neutral atom systems close the performance gap with more established technologies, competition in the field is shifting from feasibility to scalability, and QuEra‚Äôs funding signals growing confidence in this approach as a contender for the future of quantum computing.</p><p>Have a great weekend y‚Äôall.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c7fabeeb-924d-4427-b336-89a5ae933e1a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Ramp</a><span>, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a5f29d98-5257-4897-9661-1127f2215d07?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Rox</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b5a118be-adcc-41be-a875-69d09dd725f8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vanta</a></strong><span> for sponsoring!
