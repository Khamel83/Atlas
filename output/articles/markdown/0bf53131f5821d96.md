# MacBook Setup Essentials for College Students Cool Infographics

**Source:** [https://coolinfographics.com/blog/macbook-setup-college](https://coolinfographics.com/blog/macbook-setup-college)  
**Folders:** Feedly  
**Description:** It’s Back To School time of year, and if you’re a college student with a new MacBook, or a parent setting up a new MacBook, the MacBook Setup Essentials for College Students infographic is for you. These are my personal Best Practice suggestions for setting up a MacBook for college students. (and I’d love to hear your tips in the comments)

MacBook are very popular with college students, but a little planning and configuration is required for the best experience. A student moving away to college might be the first time they have full control over their own computing experience: installing apps, protecting their privacy, creating good passwords, avoiding viruses & malware, and backing up their data.

These are my suggestions for setting up a MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro for any college student to simplify their computing experience.

I tend to be the Apple tech support for my family and friends, and this year I’m sending my own son away to college. Whether you are new to Apple computers, or an experienced Apple power user, these tips will help you with the initial MacBook setup for any college student going away.

NOTE: Most of these tips are good for any MacBook user, but I’ve tailored them specific to college students.

Unlike many of my other infographic designs, this one doesn’t have any numeric data to work with. It’s a How-To informative infographic with step-by-step instructions and suggestions. That makes it a little more text-heavy than I normally like, but in this case I felt it was appropriate.
