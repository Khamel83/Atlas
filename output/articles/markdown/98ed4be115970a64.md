The prototype, a white minivan with rounded sides, an all-glass roof, sliding doors and whitewall tires, was designed to comfortably seat four people and inspired by the classic flower-power Volkswagen microbus. The design was referred to within Apple, not always affectionately, as the Bread Loaf. The plan was for the vehicle to hit the market some five years later with a giant TV screen, a powerful audio system and windows that adjusted their own tint. The cabin would have club seating like a private plane, and passengers would be able to turn some of the seats into recliners and footrests.</p><p>Most important, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/driverless-cars-have-arrived-and-they-all-look-like-loaves-of-bread">Bread Loaf</a> would have what’s known in the industry as Level 5 autonomy, driving entirely on its own using a revolutionary onboard computer, a new operating system and cloud software developed in-house. There would be no steering wheel and no pedals, just a video-game-style controller or iPhone app for driving at low speed as a backup. Alternately, if the car found itself in a situation that it was unable to navigate, passengers would phone in to an Apple command center and ask to be driven remotely.</p></div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/help/question/submit-feedback-news-coverage/"><span>Contact us:</span><div>Provide news feedback or report an error</div></a></div><div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/tips/"><span>Confidential tip?</span><div>Send a tip to our reporters</div></a></div><div><a href="https://bmedia.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0xQ0jMsQ7QLRlj0?slug=2024-03-06/apple-car-s-crash-design-details-tim-cook-s-indecision-failed-tesla-deal"><span>Site feedback:</span><div><span>Take our Survey</span></div></a></div><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal-learn-more/?utm_source=bbg&amp;utm_medium=intpro&amp;utm_campaign=trmnl&amp;utm_content=web_dotcom&amp;tactic=794999"><div><div>Before it’s here, it’s on the <span>Bloomberg Terminal</span></div><div> LEARN MORE</div></div></a></div></div></div>
