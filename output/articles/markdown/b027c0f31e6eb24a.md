Really, the Chapter 11 part of financial restructuring usually happens, when you get to a maturity and there’s no other alternative. Chapter 11 is always the last alternative, that kind of a full-scale restructuring is the last alternative. Today, there is aggressive money. There’s risk-oriented money. There’s a lot of capital that will find a way to play in a capitalization and extend maturity. There’s also — again, the liability management exercises we do now are pretty sophisticated. The large institutions are willing to participate and do the analysis. If the company has a valid business usually provide runway.”</em></p><p><em>“So I think that will be the dominant part of what we call restructuring. I think it’s going to be gradual and continuous, because the size of the credit market just has gotten so much bigger over the last seven or eight years, and it’s — you can almost do a regression and the amount of restructuring, reliability management you have is a direct correlative event to how much issuance happened somewhere between two to four years before the event. There’s just going to be a percentage of issues. And if the market is growing, the liability management market will continue to grow.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Can someone run that regression for us so we know when we can hang up our hats and call it quits?

What I have said repeatedly and I think I might have been a minority of one was that this was a long tailed restructuring cycle that this restructuring cycle bears no resemblance to what we saw 2020 to 2021. I think when I said that I was out by myself, I think now that's become much more conventional wisdom. We stand by that. This is a multiyear cycle. And even though central banks have moved the short term, if you look at what's happened in the long term rates, you know, have been stubbornly high and the long end of the curve has moved higher, the refinancing walls in the very near term have been addressed. But if you look out 2-3-4 years, there's yet another, another wall of maturities that will need to be addressed. You have a world that speeds up more technological innovation, more disruption, more creation. But when you have more creation, somewhere in the world, you have more destruction. And that's how you end up with more companies needing to rethink the balance sheet that they have because oftentimes the balance sheet that they have was not designed for the competitive environment that they are in.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Out by himself?

The debtors shifted their business considerably in response to the COVID-19 experience. Off-premises sales went from 8% to 25% as the debtors diversified their business towards online and mobile ordering, pick-up, and white-label delivery. The debtors have also been putting franchisees out of their misery, snapping up underperforming or retiring franchisees and, in many cases, closing or assigning them to others. Supply chain issues and inflation also both bit into performance. </span></p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Gift Cards</strong><span>. This company has … wait for it … nearly $50mm(!) in outstanding customer gift card obligations out there because the cards NEVER expire.

How much will a TGIF franchise run you in the US?

The securitization entities, including </span><strong>TGI Fridays Franchisor LLC</strong><span>, sacked TGI Friday’s Inc. as manager in early September, due to, among other things, reporting failures. </span><strong>FTI Consulting Inc. ($FCN)</strong><span> has been the back-up manager since.** The company and the securitization entities are now operating pursuant to a transition services agreement which has a number of extensions built in to it which could take it through the end of Q1’25. This termination, however, was impactful. Per the debtors, “</span><em>As a result of the termination of TGI Friday’s Inc. as Manager, the Company lost a significant portion of its revenue stream as the Company would no longer receive the benefit of the restaurant royalty payments.</em><span>” </span></p><p>There’s more. The debtors may actually owe up to $30mm to the securitization entities on account of nonpayment of royalties related to both the franchise agreements and IP licenses. This would make the securitization entities the largest unsecured creditors in the cases. </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Pre-petition Cap Stack</strong><span>. Compounding the lingering effects of the pandemic and the sacking of TGI Friday’s Inc. as manager under the franchise agreements is a dangerous mix of floating rate debt plus insanely high-rate fixed debt. See ⬇️. But much of it, once you get below the </span><strong>Texas Partners Bank (d/b/a The Bank of San Antonio, “BofSA”)</strong><span> component, involves equity sponsor </span><strong>Mr. Anil Yadav</strong><span>, a businessman known in the franchisee space.* </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9477b448-12b6-4571-b5ea-7a743e707aba?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_527,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F734f5ef6-19cf-419f-a1eb-3688cc0e4f82_527x579.png"></a></figure></div><p>The Yadav Kids Note, the Table Turn Note, and the Freebird Note are all subordinated in right of payment to the BofSA loan. </p><p>The debtors cite approximately $51.8mm due to trade creditors, exclusive of employee obligations and customer programs. The top 50 largest general unsecured creditors include a good mix of digital marketing companies and landlords but very few vendors (since many went COD pre-petition).  </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Financing</strong><span>. The debtors have a commitment from Texas Partners Bank for a $23.9mm 10%-interest DIP, comprised of $5.9mm in new money and an $18mm roll-up ($3.3mm of new money and $6.6mm total interim, representing a 1:1 roll-up to new money); they’ll also get to use their lenders’ cash collateral. There’s a 2% commitment fee (1% upfront, 1% at maturity) on the new money portion. The DIP matures in 90 days, subject to certain milestones. At the first day hearing, the UST expressed some concern over the DIP lenders “materially improving” their position by getting super-priority over the assets of certain entities that weren’t original borrowers but those concerns were — despite the restaurants still having “lovely … Tiffany-style lamps” and “buttons and pins” and “flair” — summarily dismissed (Per Judge Jernigan, “</span><em>I'm not sure any of that is like tremendous new collateral as opposed to the bank already having a lien in the equity.</em><span>”). </span></p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Go-forward?</strong><span> The TL;DR is that this is yet another sh*tty sale case and, as of the petition date, there’s no stalking horse purchaser to anchor the process. That said, there were some encouraging signs. Per debtors’ counsel </span><strong>Chris Dickerson</strong><span> of </span><strong>Ropes &amp; Gray LLP</strong><span>:</span></p><pre><code><code>"...it's envisioned that it will be an approximately 60-day process. As you will note, we do not yet have an investment banker, but we are actively interviewing them and hope to have one in place here this week. That's required, that's a necessary part of our meeting the milestone that requires us to have filed the sale procedures motion within eight days of the petition date, as well as to identify a stalking horse. We have had numerous pre-petition indications of interest in purchasing some or all of the debtors' assets, including one in which we are pretty far down the road and are working to try to bring to the table as a stocking horse bidder. It is our hope that when we do file the sale procedures motion that it will include a stalking horse bidder. As you would expect, in addition to the handful of parties that we had been dealing with prior to the petition date, we have received numerous indications of interest in participating in that process since the filing, and we will, of course, in conjunction with the investment banker that will be hired by the company, subject to your honor's approval, of course, look to involve as many parties as possible so that we can, again, have a value-maximizing process."</code></code></pre><p>Man.
