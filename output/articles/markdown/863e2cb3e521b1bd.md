**Description:** As Hurricane Irma slowly churned through the Caribbean leaving a trail of destruction, a large swath of the region was utterly devoid of any and all aircraft. Well, except for one aircraft. People from around the world were fascinated by images of a Delta 737 flying to San Juan, Puerto Rico as Irma approached. They weren’t actual images or video of an aircraft, though. It was merely an icon on an map from flight tracking site Flightradar24.

Flightradar24 is the largest of several aircraft tracking services available to the public. Flightradar and other similar services let users zoom into any part of the world and see aircraft movement in real time, even while planes are still on the ground at many airports.

These services rely primarily on a technology known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast, or ADS-B for short. ADS-B collects vital position and movement data from an aircraft’s transponder, such as altitude, speed, heading, and dozens of other attributes, and transmits it at a frequency of 1090 MHz to anyone listening.

As air traffic control slowly shifts from a 20th-century technology, radar-based tracking of aircraft, to ADS-B, Flightradar has been constructing its own network of receivers worldwide. Each receiver consists of a small computer, a GPS antenna and an ADS-B frequency antenna. Flightradar distributes the receivers to local hosts anywhere in the world it may need to boost coverage in exchange for premium site subscriptions. Alternatively, local hosts may have their own equipment and choose to upload data to multiple sites.

Some of the places volunteers have placed receivers are nothing short of amazing. From the Troll Research Station in Antarctica to Chernobyl, Ukraine, these receivers are capable of providing detailed flight information in areas where traditional radar coverage has never existed, and will never exist.

“Flightradar24 now has over 16,000 ADS-B receivers around world helping track flights on all seven continents,” said Ian Petchenik, Director of Communications for Flightradar24. “We track an average of 175,000 flights per month and that number continues to rise as we add new receivers.”

While Flightradar covers thousands of flights per day, the airline industry is still far from equipping all aircraft with ADS-B technology. In the United States, approximately 52% of aircraft transmit ADS-B signals, a number that hasn’t significantly risen in recent years, even has a 2020 mandate to equip all airplanes looms. Globally, the number jumps to 65%, but still a far cry from every aircraft.

In order to track aircraft that aren’t transmitting ADS-B location data, a technology called Multilateration (MLAT) is used. MLAT uses multiple ADS-B receivers to triangulate the approximate location of an aircraft to an accuracy of about 10-20 meters with coverage nearly down to ground level and a delay of a few seconds. MLAT tracking isn’t perfect, but it’s far better than the radar data provided by the FAA when all else fails. In the case where an aircraft operates far outside of the coverage area, Flightradar will estimate its flight path along the shortest path to its destination. Once it re-enters coverage, the actual position is then displayed.

As we all learned in third grade science class, most of the planet is water, not land. This fact presents a bit of a problem for a company that relies on ground-based receivers. In an attempt to cover the remaining 71% of the planet’s surface, Flightradar has been experimenting with tiny satellites equipped with ADS-B receives. During a trial in 2016, Flightradar was able to receive terrestrial-bound signals from aircraft over the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. A separate waterborne trial was conducted by equipping a small autonomous boat with ADS-B receivers and a satellite uplink. The aptly nicknamed “floatradar” boat can be remotely positioned to boost coverage in critical areas.

While Flightradar has nearly global coverage at this point, some aircraft will never be shown on the map. This isn’t due to any particular technical reason or issue, but rather because they are military or specific private aircraft. To protect operational security of military operations, as well as the privacy or certain private jet operators, these aircraft either have their details censored or are removed from the database entirely. Removal of private aircraft is conducted per request, and not proactively. Sorry, but you will never see Air Force One on Flightradar.

To some hardcore planespotters and aviation geeks, hiding certain aircraft is a bit of a problem. Just like how Flightradar has built out a network of crowdsourced ADS-B receivers, a website named ADS-B Exchange has attempted to do the same, but without hiding any aircraft information. While its worldwide coverage is nowhere near as robust as Flightradar, all aircraft, including military aircraft, are displayed.

ADS-B Exchange says its site displays all data unfiltered because the ADS-B signals emitted from aircraft are unencrypted and over-the-air, much like an ordinary radio signal, and anyone with $100 and an Amazon account can build their own receiver. Leaving the data unfiltered is valuable to plane spotters looking to snap shots of unusual or special aircraft.

In a few short years, flight tracking has gone from proprietary government and airline data to freely accessible and available nearly anywhere on the planet. As space-based receivers become cheaper, there will not be a single place left uncovered by the various tracking services in operation today.

<div><p>On any given day, even with the drop in air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are thousands of airplanes flying over the United States and the rest of the world — commercial jets, general aviation and private aircraft and military planes from various armed forces. If you are an <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/avgeek-experiences/">AvGeek</a>, you know that there are apps and sites you can use to track those planes and tell exactly what the one you've just seen fly over is. You can use them to track aircraft you cannot see, too. We'll talk about the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/how-to-use-flight-tracker-apps/">two most commonly used apps</a>, Flightradar24 and FlightAware, which both have iOS and Android versions and a website as well.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, you can just ask "Siri, what flights are overhead?" — and the voice-activated digital assistant will return a screen like this one. The two tables taken together will give you a pretty good idea of what is flying above you. But you can know a lot more than altitude, distance, aircraft type, airline and flight number. You can find out pretty much everything about a flight, in real time, and anywhere in the world.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2020/07/image_from_ios-1.png?fit=600%2C1299px&amp;quality=1&amp;width=1080#038;ssl=1"></div><figcaption>iPhone screen cap by Riley Arthur/The Points Guy</figcaption></figure><p>With Flightradar24 and FlightAware, you can find out granular details including how fast and high a flight is, its route, the exact airplane operating it and when it was built, and what routes it flew before, even months in the past.</p><p><strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/newsletters/daily/">Sign up for the free daily TPG newsletter</a> for more aviation news!</strong></p><p>Flightradar24 calls itself the most popular flight-tracker app; the Google Play store shows it has more than 10 million installs, while FlightAware has more than five million. Flightradar24 is the more customizable of the two, and while FlightAware says it tracks more flights, it lacks options like showing planes on the ground.

Some of those codes are pretty intuitive; if you see a plane labeled "A321," it's easy to deduct you're looking at an Airbus A321. But what about a BLCF or an A20N? Fortunately, ICAO publishes the codes <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/Search.aspx">in a searchable database</a>.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-10.43.02-AM.png?width=1080"></div><figcaption>Screen cap from ICAO</figcaption></figure><p>Not <em>everything</em> can be tracked, though, or at least not fully. Many private planes, for example, will display as "Blocked," with no data beyond the ability to track their route. That's because their owners have requested anonymity. Military planes mostly do not appear on flight-tracking sites because of operational secrecy, even when they are on innocuous missions. That's where another flight-tracking site comes in, at least for the military planes: <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/">ADS-B Exchange</a>. (There's no app, but it works fine on the mobile web.)</p><p>Like the others, it's based on ADS-B technology, an acronym that stands for "Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast." Airplanes have devices called transponders, which transmit data to air traffic control including altitude, speed, heading and more. Unlike the others, it does not censor the ADS-B data of military aircraft, so you'll be able to see them there. Go to ADS-B Exchange's <a href="https://tar1090.adsbexchange.com/">"Radar View" page</a> and click on the U indicated by the red arrow to isolate only military traffic. You may see aircraft without much information next to them, but with the unmistakably aggressive silhouette of a fighter jet — for example the two green F-16s in the image below, flying under the call signs "Gundog 7" and "Gundog 9."</p><p>You may even be able to see <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/09/the-vip-jets-of-world-leaders/">Air Force One</a> this way; it can sometimes be spotted on the tracker as "AF1."</p><div><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-10.07.50-AM.jpg?width=1080"></div></div></div>
