You may also recall that the debtors’ latest bankruptcy papers came in blazing hot — with fingers pointing at all kinds of culprits for their sad state of affairs. The 22 is due to the vendors, they said! And customers, they added!! And, finally, the lenders!!! At the first day hearing, we got a healthy dose of schtick coupled with an equally robust helping of conspiracy theory. Did the FILO Agent, </span><strong>1903P Loan Agent LLC</strong><span> (“1903 Agent”) and (one of) the FILO lenders, </span><strong>1903 Partners LLC</strong><span> (“1903,” together with 1903 Agent, the “1903 Parties”), squeeze the debtors with robust reserves (assisted, in large part by the ABL lenders) so that the FILO lenders could recover the FILO at par </span><em>and</em><span> an affiliate, </span><strong>Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC</strong><span> (“GBRP”), could get the cherry on top as stalking horse purchaser and liquidator (aided, in large part, by a truncated sale process)? Inquiring minds want to know? And by “inquiring minds” we mean not just the non-FILO term lenders due $153.4mm and on the verge of a big fat f*ckening (the “ad hoc group”), but also general unsecured creditors due over $130mm in payables (exclusive of rejection damages claims) and, like, 19,000(!) employees. </span></p><p>In our post-filing initiation we wrote, </p><pre><code><code>“…the [stalking horse] agreement would ensure the world ends up one “yarn and yarn accessories” purveyor lonelier. We won’t opine on whether that’s the right market outcome, but it’s difficult to argue that a sale process that started in mid-December and ended up in the hands of a lender’s liquidator affiliate a month later shouldn't get a good measure of scrutiny. We’re sure the ad hoc term loan group will keep doling out that medicine and is likely to be joined by the official committee of unsecured creditors after they’ve joined the party.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Introducing </span><strong>Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Jason Adams</strong><span>, counsel to the official committee of unsecured creditors (“UCC”), joining the party: </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/45b8f5dc-fc5b-44fa-8c6e-88bf84d59b60?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_472,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27aadf1f-fa4d-4076-859c-1ec06abc7363_472x262.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>And what kind of party is this exactly?

Here is the ad hoc group: </p><pre><code><code>“The circumstances of this Chapter 22 filing in general, and the relief requested in the Motions specifically, are extraordinary.[] Just four months after the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, the FILO Agent – a Gordon Brothers affiliate – unilaterally imposed a reserve against the ABL/FILO borrowing base, citing unspecified business deterioration as the purported basis for imposition of the reserve. The notice was, in the Debtors’ own words, a “highly unusual and not customary or reasonable use of discretion” by the FILO Agent. The Debtors warned that the reserve would directly impact the Debtors’ liquidity position and potentially cause irreparable and permanent harm to their business. But Gordon Brothers (which is also an affiliate of a FILO Lender) did not relent. The Debtors’ admonition proved correct, and the coercive reserve ultimately forced the Debtors into an expedited fire sale to Gordon Brothers with illegal terms that dictate the ABL/FILO Lenders will be the only creditors likely to receive any recovery.”</code></code></pre><p>Yeeeeeeeeeeeah, not happy. Of course, a lot of the ad hoc group’s beef is better served fresh during an actual sale hearing rather than a bid procedures motion hearing but, whatevs, there were already shots fired. Still, for now, the best the ad hoc group could hope for was to extend the process to allow time to draw competitive bids, open up the possibility of a credit bid, and affect consultation rights throughout the sale process. </p><p>For their part, Mr. Adams and the UCC — which is made up of three landlords and six trade creditors — also shot back. After all, they’re offended; they don’t love how the debtors assigned them the blame; and they want the 1903 Parties and GBRP to know that they can go f*ck themselves. Per the UCC: </p><pre><code><code>“The Debtors emerged from their first bankruptcy on April 30, 2024, after implementing a prepackaged plan that restructured debt, but made no operational changes. Nine months later, the Debtors commenced these cases to implement a wholesale liquidation and seek this Court’s approval to do so in less than 30 days. The stalking horse bid from Gordon Brothers, an affiliate of FILO lender and agent 1903P, will result in the loss of 19,000 jobs, leave landlords for approximately 800 locations without a tenant, and leave hundreds of suppliers without a customer. The Debtors and their lenders take no blame for this devastating result. Instead, in their pleadings and at the first day hearing both seek to cast the blame on the vendors, owed over $100 million, that refused to ship goods. Having retained advisors one week ago, the Committee intends to test these allegations to determine the cause of this devastating collapse of this company.

The Debtors and the prepetition ABL and FILO Lenders orchestrated a timeline that deprives the Committee any opportunity to fulfill its statutory obligations to creditors. The Debtors enter bankruptcy with a bid from Gordon Brothers that will pay off the ABL and FILO Lenders in full, including Gordon Brothers affiliate 1903P. This payoff leaves nothing for unsecured creditors. Nothing for unsecured creditors because the bid includes not just inventory, but all potential litigation claims and avoidance actions, including preference claims against insiders and the Lenders themselves.”</code></code></pre><p>Well guess what folks, the 1903 Parties don’t like f*cking themselves. </p><p><span>In its response, the 1903 Agent pointed to the debtors’ own evidentiary record, which cited “</span><em>the prolonged impact of an excessively sluggish retail economy</em><span>” and “</span><em>inventory challenges</em><span>” as factors leading to the 22. They wrote: </span></p><pre><code><code>"The Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group refuse to accept this reality and have instead sought to proffer an alternate narrative that would allow them to extract undue value from the ABL/FILO Lenders. They emphasize that the FILO Agent is affiliated with the same corporate group as the Stalking Horse Bidder, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLP (“GBRP”). But that observation is legally irrelevant, because this Court has repeatedly recognized there is nothing improper about affiliated lenders and liquidators working on the same cases."</code></code></pre><p><span>To support that last statement, the 1903 Agent cited two other horror show bankruptcies, </span><em>In re Brookstone Holdings Corp.</em><span> and </span><em>In re Christmas Tree Shops LLC</em><span>. 😬. They added: </span></p><pre><code><code>"The Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group now speculate that the second bankruptcy was the result of a sinister plot by the FILO Agent to weaponize an availability reserve to drive the business into the arms of GBRP. The facts — including the sworn evidence submitted by the Debtors explaining the reasons for their dismal financial performance and the filing of these cases — bely their story. Indeed, the only reserve imposed by the FILO Agent (the “FILO Availability Reserve”) was based on the FILO Agent’s reasonable business judgment and pursuant to its Permitted Discretion[] under the express terms of the ABL/FILO Credit Agreement. The FILO Availability Reserve was a $10 million reserve implemented nearly half a year prior to the Petition Date, and was a fraction of the reserve that the FILO Agent could have established based on the substantial justifications cited to the Debtors in support of the reserve before it was actually implemented in September 2024. Months later, in December 2024, the ABL Agent exercised its own Permitted Discretion to impose two additional reserves of $30 million and $50 million."</code></code></pre><p><span>Hmmm, so the argument is kinda sorta that the 1903 Parties conspired with the ABL lenders </span><em>and</em><span> fellow FILO lender, </span><strong>Centerbridge Credit CS LP</strong><span> (which holds ~$75mm of the FILO), to set up a liquidator affiliate with some business? Curious, 🤔.***</span></p><pre><code><code>"Contrary to the Committee’s assertion that the Debtors emerged from the Prior Bankruptcy Cases “poised for success,” almost immediately upon emergence from the Prior Bankruptcy Cases, the Debtors significantly underperformed relative to their business plan. In the months following their emergence, the Debtors missed sales and cash receipts forecasts on a weekly basis, failed to secure improved trade terms from vendors on the projected timeline, and suffered adverse conditions related to inventory levels and mix, which contributed to lagging sales. </code></code></pre><p>Repeat: a flawed construct. It gets better: </p><pre><code><code>For example, as of July 2024 month-end, the Debtors’ fiscal year to date adjusted EBITDA was $71.1 million below the level projected in their post-restructuring business plan ($-47.6 million actual, versus $23.6 million plan).[] The Debtors’ three-month year-over-year sales trend had decreased 9.9% and continued to trend downward.[] Contrary to the insinuations made by the Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group during depositions, the FILO Agent did not impose the FILO Availability Reserve solely because the Debtors habitually underperformed their never-ending amended business projections. Instead, this lower-than-expected financial performance impaired the net orderly liquidation value (“NOLV”) of the Debtors’ inventory, which significantly threatened the FILO Lenders’ recovery in a downside scenario." </code></code></pre><p>And even better: </p><pre><code><code>"In addition, the FILO Agent soon uncovered irregularities with respect to the Debtors’ financial reporting. The FILO Agent conducted a physical inventory count at a sample set of the Debtors’ stores and determined that the Debtors had materially underestimated the ongoing level of inventory “shrink” (which refers to a negative discrepancy between the recorded amount of inventory and the actual amount on hand, caused by factors like theft, damage, or administrative errors).[] The Debtors calculated shrink at 1.4% using a historical percentage of sales method, while the result of the FILO Agent’s analysis concluded that actual shrink averaged approximately 2.7%.[]"</code></code></pre><p>Damn. Grannies across America be thieving as f*ck.

If the FILO Borrowing Base is overstated by a certain amount and the FILO Lenders continue to lend against it, they are essentially lending “naked” (unsecured by collateral) on the overstated portion."</code></code></pre><p><span>“But wait, </span><strong>PETITION</strong><span>, isn’t this a lot of posturing that doesn’t necessary apply to the bidding procedures stage of these cases?” Why, yes, dearly astute readers, it is. And by the time of the hearing, the debtors had already made some progress assuaging many of the concerns that </span><em>were actually relevant</em><span> to the bid procedures motion. Indeed, the term lenders were barely even a factor at the big procedures hearing. That’s because, by then, GBRP had agreed to a new stalking horse agreement containing a framework that would (i) potentially deliver value to the ad hoc group — something that was, in case you couldn’t tell, kind of a big sticking point for the ad hoc group**** — and, (ii) continue to provide funding for a wind-down that would keep the cases administratively solvent.***** Per </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Jeff Michalik</strong><span>:****** </span></p><pre><code><code>“Not to bury the lede, the term lenders have not consented. So, we do still have some wood to chop there, but we believe that the stalking horse agreement in its current form maintains our path to further constructive settlement discussions.”</code></code></pre><p>In other words, the debtors were able to get the ad hoc group to back off on their objection to the bid procedures motion (but sale and cash collateral issues remain and the parties continue to negotiate). </p><p>Similarly, the UCC backed off on most of its objection to the bid procedures motion too.******* Why? The debtors agreed to extend (i) the sale time line by a week and (ii) the UCC’s challenge period to 10 days past the sale hearing with an outside date of March 7, 2025. </p><p>But this left one big issue as far as the UCC was concerned. The big procedures still included 1903 Agent, in its agent capacity, as a consultation party.******** Which basically means that it would have a direct say over any potential bids that compete with its affiliate, GBRP. Judge Goldblatt wasn’t having it: </p><pre><code><code>“I start with the proposition that you're either a buyer or a seller. You're not both. And so I understand the notion that the FILO lenders should participate as a consultation party. But the notion that we're here with a FILO lender who's the agent who is also an affiliate of the buyer is a problem of their own making. And I don't want to prejudice the rights of other holders, but isn't there a solution in which another FILO holder serves as the consultation party?”</code></code></pre><p>He continued: </p><pre><code><code>“…during an auction, there are strategic conversations about how to maximize value and how to bring in more. And the notion that someone who's an affiliate of one of the buyers is in the room when you're having those conversations feels funky to me. And there seems to be a readily available solution.”</code></code></pre><p>That solution? Centerbridge.********* </p><p>With that understanding and notwithstanding a trio of UST objections, Judge Goldblatt approved the bidding procedures motion with what remained a rather aggressive timeline:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bfe9da10-1e0a-4f4c-a7f2-7c9fedb99359?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae49bcef-2d10-45f3-b720-44de610fb25c_638x383.png"></a><figcaption>Source: Dkt. 446-1</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>We’ll obviously know soon enough — </span><em>like maybe even literally today</em><span> — whether anyone will challenge GBRP for (what’s left of) these assets.**********</span></p><h5>*The cash collateral motion, you’ll note, is also referenced in the objections but that has been kicked for an undetermined day in the future. </h5><h5>**The UST nevertheless objected but saw its objection overruled. </h5><h5>***We should note here that the debtors’ proposed investment banker, Ryan Kielty at Centerview Partners, testified that the GBRP was market tested at the outset of the sale and marketing process. Three liquidators submitted bids for the debtors’ assets, but GBRP provided the highest guaranteed cash proceeds to the estates for all the debtors’ assets. The competition offered guarantees that were over $70mm lower and they were incomplete bids: one was for just inventory, PP&amp;E and IP, while the other was just for inventory. </h5><h5><span>****Mr. Kielty testified that one improvement to the GBRP bid is that the term lenders will stand to benefit from 35% of the liquidation proceeds raised “</span><em>…in excess of the cash that Gordon Brothers has outlaid to fund the purchase price, to fund the operating expenses of the liquidation, and then a series of liquidator agent fees on each of the asset categories that they're going to be working to liquidate.</em><span>” Sounds like quite the hurdle. </span></h5><h5>*****Speaking of “administrative solvency,” Centerview dropped their retention application on the docket on February 18, 2025 and they’ll clip $175k/month (so already $350k) plus $5.5mm as a “transaction fee” even though the “transaction” here is, absent some miracle, a handover to the 1903 Parties followed by a plan of liquidation. Not too shabby for two-to-three months of work. They were retained on December 9, 2024. </h5><h5>******Pressure to deliver on the green sweater apparently proved to be too much. </h5><h5>*******Other big issues obviously remain, however, including the fact that the current sale construct transfers (i) potential litigation claims against GBRP to GBRP and (ii) chapter 5 avoidance actions to GBRP in a case where general unsecured claims are set to get 🍩. </h5><h5>********The debtors indicated that they had no issue with 1903 as a consultation party because, presumably, as agent, 1903 owes fiduciary duties to other lenders, i.e., Centerbridge. Moreover, the debtors stated that the consultation rights were fine because 1903 was offering a cash bid rather than a credit bid — an argument that was, uh, confounding. Suffice it to say, Judge Goldblatt didn’t buy it. </h5><h5>*********Centerbridge is represented in these cases by Proskauer Rose LLP (Charles Dale, Adam Nowicki). </h5><h5>**********The debtors are shutting 100s of locations pursuant to the Court’s store closing sale order entered on February 14, 2025. Are you a gift card holder? You’ve got 14 days from the date of the order to use that sucker so get on it.

Sales of PCHI’s consumer products division also declined 24.8% in the same period, due partially to lower intercompany sales to PCHI’s retail division.”</code></code></pre><p>Uh oh. We’re reading that and looking back at that ABL/FILO component and, well, stop us if this sounds familiar: </p><pre><code><code>These factors placed significant pressure on the Company’s business and liquidity position. As a result, in September 2024, PCHI launched an effort to raise incremental capital to fund the Company’s business plan and navigate through a projected liquidity trough. A confluence of factors—all further described below—frustrated those efforts, leaving the Company with insufficient runway to effectuate its long-term growth strategy while maintaining the liquidity necessary to operate its business. Among other things, the Company’s efforts to obtain additional capital from either the ABL/FILO Lenders (as defined herein), the holders of the Company’s Second Lien Notes (who are also PCHI’s majority owners), and third-party strategic investors and lenders were unavailing. After the ABL Agent (as defined herein) instituted a $50 million discretionary reserve under the ABL/FILO Facilities (as defined herein), on December 10, 2024, PCHI found itself in default thereunder. Without any prospect for incremental capital or a liquidity infusion from the Company’s existing lenders or investors, PCHI was compelled to pivot to a liquidation strategy, to be effected through chapter 11.</code></code></pre><p>LOL, you mean to tell us that the ad hoc noteholder group that’s already seen over a billion dollars of cold hard cash incinerated didn’t want to triple down?!?
