This was the most jam-packed week of optimistic stories we‚Äôve had in a long time. There were probably 8 or 9 stories that could have reasonably made the cut here ‚Äî stories that would have led the Dose five years ago sitting on the cutting room floor is a good sign for humanity. </span></p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it.</p><p><em>Ashlee Vance for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em>E11‚Äôs approach, more or less, is to have a brain label itself. The lab does this by injecting a mouse brain with viruses that carry snippets of DNA to individual neurons and instruct the neurons to make special proteins. These proteins then become the biological equivalent of a barcode... The brain tissue, in essence, has built-in labels of its various structures and paths of wiring.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d3f916a6-a05c-48b8-acf7-b9d017f434af?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a7d223c-3a21-4267-a597-66aba7fd34ad_2200x1467.webp"></a></figure></div><p>E11 Bio, a research organization backed by Eric Schmidt, is redefining brain mapping by injecting mouse brains with viruses that label neurons with unique protein barcodes. Basically the approach is like teaching mouse brains to barcode themselves so they can scan their neurons like groceries.</p><p><span>This brain mapping method drastically reduces time and cost, slashing the need for millions of microscope slices and tedious AI proofreading. E11 Bio injects viruses into the brain to create protein barcodes for neurons, enabling researchers to trace neural connections using colorful optical imaging </span><em>(see image above!)</em><span>. This method skips the need for slicing the brain into thousands of pieces and avoids costly, time-consuming manual proofreading and electron microscopy.</span></p><p>If they‚Äôre successful, we could have detailed brain maps that unlock breakthrough neurological treatments, advance AI by mimicking brain function, and uncover the fundamental workings of the human mind. Long way to go ‚Äî brain mapping has traditionally been costly, timely, and too static to provide real-time value ‚Äî but if teams like E11 are successful, we might finally have a much deeper understanding of how these brains of ours work.</p><p><em>Cho et al in Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>A pilot clinical study showed that DBS</span><sup>LH</sup><span> immediately improved walking in two participants with incomplete SCI and, in conjunction with rehabilitation, mediated functional recovery that persisted when DBS</span><sup>LH</sup><span> was turned off. There were no serious adverse events related to DBS</span><sup>LH</sup><span>. These results highlight the potential of targeting specific brain regions to maximize the engagement of spinal cord-projecting neurons in the recovery of neurological functions after SCI.</span></em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1ecf9d9b-6b74-456a-9dc1-d543f07ff50d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4843433-4297-437a-9012-0c42a0460aa3_1200x1130.png"></a></figure></div><p>OK, brace yourself for some acronyms. A new study revealed a breakthrough approach to restoring walking after spinal cord injuries (SCI) by targeting the brain's lateral hypothalamus (LH) with deep brain stimulation (DBS). In plainer language, the research uncovered a "walk switch" in the brain‚Äôs lateral hypothalamus, where targeted stimulation can restore walking after spinal cord injuries.</p><p>In animal trials, the research found that activating specific neurons in the LH dramatically improved walking by reorganizing the spinal cord‚Äôs remaining neural connections. Excitingly, limited human trials showed that DBS of the LH not only immediately enhanced walking but also led to long-term improvements when combined with rehab, even after the stimulation was turned off.</p><p>About 15M folks worldwide have some form of spinal chord injury and suffer varying degrees of paralysis as a result. Trials are early and the treatment won‚Äôt restore walking for everybody, but this is a big‚Ä¶step‚Ä¶toward using precise brain stimulation to repair movement after paralysis.</p><p><em>From Anduril</em></p><blockquote><p><em>By bringing together OpenAI‚Äôs advanced models with Anduril‚Äôs high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation‚Äôs defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b63ae163-afbf-420a-b2cb-eb32644331d4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1408,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F453586cc-10af-4ad3-90a1-a64082fe9408_704x977.png"></a></figure></div><p>Technology and Defense.

OpenAI is (and no shade to Anthropic, which we love here at Not Boring) the world‚Äôs leading AI lab. Together, they could produce some of the world‚Äôs most sophisticated defense technologies.</p><p>OpenAI is integrating its models into Anduril's counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS), improving the drone system‚Äôs ability to detect, assess, and respond to aerial threats in real time. Notably, this is OpenAI‚Äôs first partnership with a defense contractor, reflecting a strategic shift to support national security initiatives. It‚Äôs no surprise OpenAI chose Anduril as their inaugural partner here ‚Äî relative to its larger peers, Anduril is tech-first, much more immersed in Silicon Valley, and moves quickly.</p><p>We always get some pushback when we celebrate Anduril ‚Äî something to the effect of, ‚ÄúHow is the progress of this weapons company optimistic?‚Äù Our response is always the same: a more competent U.S. defense industry means a more powerful United States military which (if history is any indication) means a safer world which means more societal progress. And if we‚Äôre going to live in a world of drone-based defense systems (which at this point is inevitable) we might as well have them powered by the most sophisticated and competent AI technology.</p><p><em>From Ilan Price and Matthew Willson at Google DeepMind</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>GenCast provides better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and extreme events than the top operational system, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts‚Äô (</span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a6ebfdba-e03d-470b-9375-0bd1ae0d36d3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">ECMWF</a><span>) ENS, up to 15 days in advance.

Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have each partnered with, invested in, or made commitments to companies that can provide nuclear energy capacity for their energy-intensive computing needs. For their part, Meta announced an RFP to identify nuclear energy developers to deliver 1-4 GW of new nuclear capacity by the early 2030s. </p><p>According to Meta, it‚Äôs at least 5 years away from having its data centers powered by nuclear, but this is yet another big development in nuclear energy‚Äôs comback story.. in the ELECTRONAISSANCE. In committing to nuclear energy, Meta is providing yet another point of financial and industry validation for nuclear, which could further accelerate innovation, deployment, and regulatory change.

We‚Äôve covered Isaacman a few times in the Weekly Dose, but if you‚Äôre not familiar with him, here‚Äôs the quick background: he made billions founding payment processor Shift4 Payments, parlayed that into founding aerospace defense contractor Draken International, and then famously commanded the first all-civilian spaceflight, Inspiration4‚Ä¶and most recently led the Polaris Dawn mission, becoming the first private citizen to perform a spacewalk. And now, in what you can only imagine is a boyhood dream come true, Isaacman has been nominated by President Trump to lead NASA.</p><p><span>Without knowing all of the politics around and nuances of NASA Administration, I feel confident in saying the Isaacman pick was a good one, for a couple of reasons. First, Isaacman is the perfect combination of successful businessman and passionate explorer ‚Äî which hopefully means he‚Äôll be able to not only run NASA more efficiently and effectively, but will also do so with the zeal of an astronaut missionary. Second, Isaacman has a very, very close relationship with Elon Musk. Musk has been, and likely will continue to be given his new role in the Trump Administration, NASA‚Äôs most important partner. If Isaacman can avoid obvious conflicts of interest traps and leverage this relationship with Musk properly, it should mean a much deeper relationship with the world‚Äôs most important private space company. And finally, Isaacman just seems like a legitimately great guy ‚Äî the kind of guy that you look at and think ‚Äúman, they don‚Äôt really make them like that any more.‚Äù Family-oriented, seemingly very kind (</span><em>watch the Netflix doc and then tell me otherwise</em><span>), financially successful, patriotic, and‚Ä¶a groundbreaking astronaut? He really is like Iron Man, but if Iron Man was from a middle-class family in Jersey and way less douchey.  </span></p><p>After basically being stagnant for a couple of decades, NASA has started to get its mojo back with more ambitious and inspiring programs. Isaacman could be the man to cement the comeback and restore NASA‚Äôs glory. </p><p>Have a great weekend y‚Äôall.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b8da0bf5-b88a-44f2-b7b6-069abe9120d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">AlphaSense</a></strong><span> for sponsoring!
