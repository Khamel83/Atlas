It was a busy week over here at Not Boring HQ. But you know who certainly had busier weeks? Sam Altman and Donald Trump. Altman unveiled OpenAI‚Äôs leadership position in one of history‚Äôs largest projects and also released, Operator, a product that many folks believe will change how we get things done. Trump launched $TRUMP on a Friday, was inaugurated on a Tuesday, and introduced a flurry of Executive Orders throughout the rest of the week. So yeah, we had a busy week but everything is relative.</span></p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it.</p><p><strong><span>Today‚Äôs Weekly Dose is brought to you by‚Ä¶ </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f52a5632-84b1-4dc9-a3db-8b07089f9160?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">HubSpot</a></strong></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f52a5632-84b1-4dc9-a3db-8b07089f9160?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d3ec8d-4cef-462d-b9d7-85ed99092759_839x258.png"></a></figure></div><p><em>Unlock Your Productivity Potential with 4 Proven Strategies.

The scale of Stargate lands it in the company of other historically massive projects such as the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Apollo Program, and China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative. As I said, it doesn‚Äôt get much bigger than this.</p><p>The plan is to immediately start deploying $100B and overtime up the investment into things like massive AI data centers, advanced computer and hardware capabilities, and the energy infrastructure needed to power it all. Ideally, this investment will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the U.S., but if it‚Äôs successful, you‚Äôd also imagine they‚Äôll be a wave of creative job destruction live we‚Äôve never seen before. Stargate is pulling forward the AI revolution and ensuring that revolution happens right here on U.S. soil.</p><p><span>Behind all of the ambition, there‚Äôs of course some drama. Who is involved. Who was left out. OpenAI is taking operational responsibility for Stargate (and supposedly already has a Stargate team internally), while Soft Bank is taking financial responsibility (again, as a rule, never count out Masa.)

It‚Äôs all pretty confusing and intertwined‚Ä¶Elon is an ex-OpenAI co-founder, is now suing and competing against OpenAI, while Larry Ellison who is a known Elon-backer, is teaming up with OpenAI to make it all possible, and Trump is seemingly stiff-arming Elon on this deal but elevating him everywhere else.

Operator can handle both simple, repetitive tasks as well as more involved tasks that require web browsing and interacting with the digital interface, much like we humans do. It can fill out forms, book reservations, purchase ecommerce goods, etc, etc.</p><p>Operator is powered by the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, combining GPT-4o's vision and advanced reasoning. It interacts with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in a browser, enabling it to perform tasks by ‚Äúseeing‚Äù (via screenshots) and ‚Äúclicking/typing‚Äù like a human. If it gets stuck on things like login, or payment details or recaptcha, it asks for user intervention.</p><p><span>Personally, I am pretty excited to use Operator.

Some of them are really good, in our opinion. And some of them, we don‚Äôt fully agree with. Trump‚Äôs Executive Order on American Energy is fits into the first category. </p><p>The EO prioritizes domestic energy production, resource independence, and affordability by removing regulatory barriers and revoking climate-focused policies from prior administrations. A big focus of the order is to simplify and accelerate the permitting process for energy projects by reducing NEPA-related regulatory burdens.</p><p>The EO revokes Executive Order 11991 and limits NEPA by streamlining permitting processes, emphasizing efficiency and certainty, and aligning with deadlines from the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. It directs agencies to focus solely on legislated environmental requirements, avoiding ideological or non-statutory considerations.</p><p>If America is to enter its latest golden age, it‚Äôs going to need a lot of energy. This EO ensures that the path to achieving that isn‚Äôt burdened with unnecessary red tape and regulation.</p><p><span>More good news on the energy front: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1eb360c2-5def-4e66-9164-806586cec035?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Trump said yesterday</a><span> we‚Äôll speed up electric generation buildout under emergency declaration. </span></p><p>We might actually get tired of winning‚Ä¶ if it weren‚Äôt for all this extra energy! </p><p><em>From the White House</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation‚Äôs international leadership.

Using CRISPR-based genome editing, they corrected genetic flaws that hindered yeast growth under stress, like high temperatures and limited carbon sources. Practically, making the synthetic yeast more robust and resilient is essential for industrial applications, where yeast is used to produce medicines, biofuels, and sustainable materials.</p><p>At a higher level, this is a big milestone for synthetic biology. This is the first fully synthetic eukaryotic genome, showcasing our ability to design and engineer complex, functional life forms from scratch. Today yeast, but possibly tomorrow the creation of custom organisms for applications like sustainable drug production, biofuel development, and new materials.</p><p>You can just build things.

The vision for the company is to build a logistics network of autonomous drones to deliver both critical and non-critical items to people, no matter where they live. Think of Zipline delivering life-saving medicine to an 85 year old in rural Tennessee that would otherwise have to drive an hour to their local pharmacy. Or think of a lazy 28 year old getting Buffalo Wild Wings airdropped to them at 3:00pm ET on a playoff football Sunday. Zipline can, theoretically, do both. Go Birds. </p><p>The company completed its first delivery using its new Platform 2 delivery system. P2 is a new precise and nearly silent drone system designed for both urban and rural environments. It uses autonomous droids for doorstep deliveries and electric drones. It‚Äôs the company‚Äôs play into doing more retail and ecommerce deliveries.</p><p>Its first mission, however, was delivering supplies to firefighters taking on the LA fires. It‚Äôs more symbolic than anything. But as Zipline‚Äôs CEO posted, the company eventually plans to scale to scale to 1 million deliveries a day.</p><p><em>Kyle Harrison and Anna-Sofia Lesiv for Contrary Research</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The idea is that when people canvas for opportunities to build they look at the cutting edge of technological trends or societal trends (or both).
