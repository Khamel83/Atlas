Occasionally we syndicate content from the site if we think it will interest TPG readers. This article originally appeared on Quora.com in response to the question, I’m at the Airport with 90 Minutes Before My Flight When I Realize I Have Lost My Passport. What Should I Do? and was written by Brian Teeter, author of 300 Healthy Travel Tips and publisher at Healthy Trekking.

If you’re destitute and outside the country, your local embassy or consulate can help. Every US embassy and consulate has an American Citizen Services (ACS) office to help American travelers in emergencies, including receiving wired funds from the US and replacing lost passports. Visit their Get Help in an Emergency website, or call for assistance. If you’re traveling abroad, dial 001 (202) 501-4444; in the US, call (888) 407-4747.

Have Backups Ready

This is why it’s so important to have photocopies of:

Your passport identification page

The front and back sides of your credit and ATM cards

Your driver’s license

Phone numbers of your banks, credit card issuers and travel insurance carrier

Contact information for your local embassy or consulate

If you still have your phone and can connect to the internet, we hope you stored scans of these documents and contacts safely so you can download them from a cloud storage location like Dropbox. We’ll award you extra points if you left a set with a trusted family member or friend back home, since they can do a lot to help you fix things.

Contact the Police

No matter if you’re traveling domestically or to a faraway country, absolutely, positively file a police report about your loss or theft. It’s an essential prerequisite to filing a claim on a travel insurance policy, canceling credit or ATM cards, even getting assistance from a traveler’s aid service or your embassy in getting emergency cash, not to mention a new passport. In many cases, the police might have an idea of the pickpockets or thieves who may have stolen your wallet, phone, or purse and could help to get it back.

Replace Your Passport ASAP

You will need a replacement passport to return home and for just about anything else you will need to do while you’re abroad. This is a top priority. Locate and contact your nearest embassy or consulate. You can find your closest US embassy at this link; Canadian citizens can find embassy locations at this directory. Ask to speak to the Consular Section to report your passport as lost or stolen. You will need to appear in person to get a replacement, something you can usually do in a few days — if your situation is urgent, the embassy may be able to expedite processing. You will also need a police report, especially if you require expedited processing, but be prepared to pony up: a replacement US passport will cost $140. Canadian citizens can expect to pay $190 (Canadian dollars — that’s a lot of bacon). For details on Canadian passports, visit this site. US citizens whose passports are lost or stolen can also contact the National Passport Center by calling (877) 487-2778, or their after-hours number: (202) 647-4000.

To make this a lot easier, be sure to do the following before you embark on your travels:

Make a Xerox copy (and upload a digital scan to a secure cloud storage location) of your passport’s information page and any visas. It’s a smart idea to store your scanned images on an encrypted USB flash drive hidden in your luggage or hotel safe.

Jot down and securely store the address, phone and website of your closest embassy or consulate of the countries you will visit before leaving on your trip. Make sure to store this information on your phone, too, not to mention in the cloud and on that hidden USB flash drive you brought with you. (You did do that, right? Right?) Here’s why: To get that replacement passport you so desperately need, you must do this in person.

Bring along some extra passport photos. You’re probably thinking, “Yeah, right.” Well, bucko, this is why you should. Getting a passport photo taken in a foreign country when you don’t have time, money or a passport is a pain in the butt-tocks. When things go sideways, it pays to be prepared.

It’s a smart idea to enroll in the US State Department’s STEP program in advance of your trip, as it helps US citizens traveling abroad by listing your trip itinerary and information with the nearest US embassy or consulate in the countries you plan to visit so you can receive emergency information and assistance in case of a natural disaster, civil unrest or family crisis. Plus, enrolling in STEP can help your family and friends contact and assist you in an emergency.

Consider Getting a US Passport — And a US Passport Card

Almost everyone knows about passports. Less well-known is another form of a US passport, the wallet-size passport card. We think spending $55 to register for a passport card in addition to your passport makes sense.

But first, know that a passport card has limitations. You can’t use it for international air travel. That might sound like a deal-breaker, but stay with us. A passport card can be used to enter the United States from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda at land border crossings and ocean ports of entry.

Big deal, you say? Consider this: A passport card can be used as a valid form of ID when making purchases abroad and carrying a passport card rather than a passport when you’re taking in the sights of Rome, Tokyo, or Stockholm can give you the peace of mind that your real passport can be securely stored in your hotel room safe.

Now, imagine if you lost your real passport while traveling outside the US. If you still have a passport card, appearing at your closest US embassy to get a replacement passport will be much easier because the information on it will help the embassy staff with the information they need. Plus, even though you would still need a conventional US passport for a return flight home, a passport card can help you with many financial transactions until you can get a replacement.

But the coronavirus pandemic has made it simply a reminder of our hopes to be traveling again when circumstances allow.</p><p>The State Department paused all but essential passport processing operations in March 2020, due to the risk of COVID-19 spread. But as of July 6, 12 passport agencies and centers have entered Phase One of the agency's three-phase reopening plan, and four agencies and centers are now in Phase Two.</p><p>But what does that mean for you?</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2020/07/PPT-Reopening-Infographic-from-State-Department-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024px&amp;quality=1&amp;width=1080#038;ssl=1"></div><figcaption>Image courtesy of the U.S. State Department.</figcaption></figure><p>For the time being, it just means that the U.S. State Department is catching up on its backlog of nearly a quarter-million passport applications. Unfortunately, passport appointments are still being granted only in cases of life-and-death emergency with travel within 72 hours. However, the Phase Two update represents progress in the right direction.</p><p>Back in April, TPG spoke with David Pacella, senior director for strategic partnerships at RushMyPassport.com, to clarify the situation with passport applications and renewals.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about renewing or applying for a passport right now.</p><h2>Which passport agencies and centers are open right now?</h2><p>As of July 6, the four centers that have entered Phase Two include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/boston.html">Boston Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/buffalo.html">Buffalo Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/connecticut.html">Connecticut Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/new-york.html">New York Passport Agency</a></li></ul><div><picture><img src="https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg"></picture><div><div>Daily Newsletter</div><div>Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter</div><div>Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts</div></div></div><p>All four are located in the northeast region of the U.S.</p><p>The 22 centers open under Phase One include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/arkansas.html">Arkansas Passport Center</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/atlanta.html">Atlanta Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/chicago.html">Chicago Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/colorado.html">Colorado Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/dallas.html">Dallas Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/detroit.html">Detroit Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/el-paso.html">El Paso Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/honolulu.html">Honolulu Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/houston.html">Houston Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/los-angeles.html">Los Angeles Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/miami.html">Miami Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/minneapolis.html">Minneapolis Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/npc.html">National Passport Center</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/new-orleans.html">New Orleans Passport Center</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/philadelphia.html">Philadelphia Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/san-diego.html">San Diego Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/san-francisco.html">San Francisco Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/san-juan.html">San Juan Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/seattle.html">Seattle Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/vermont.html">Vermont Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/washington.html">Washington Passport Agency</a></li><li><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/western.html">Western Passport Center</a></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, this doesn't mean you can just march in to one of these centers and walk back out with a passport. During both Phase One and Phase Two of reopening, in-person appointments will only be granted for travelers who need a passport within the next 72 hours for life-or-death emergencies only. Applicants must have a confirmed appointment for same-day processing, and must wear cloth face coverings in all common areas, including the lobby, and observe strict social distancing.</p><h2>My passport expires in the next 18 months. Should I apply for my new passport right now?</h2><p>The answer is yes — travelers should apply now despite the delay, Pacella told TPG. "We anticipate passport processing services to get much, much busier once the travel ban is lifted," Pacella said. "This is the perfect time for most people to renew a passport that expires soon, since you aren't going right now and you can also beat the rush."</p><p>Pacella emphasizes that individual needs vary, but says that the average traveler who has canceled international plans for trips in the coming months would likely benefit from renewing their passport now, especially if delaying further would run the risk of jeopardizing the passport's <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/08/six-month-passport-validity-rule/">six-month validity window.</a> That rule <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/passport-visa-mistakes/">requires that travelers have more than six months</a> between the date when they return home from international travel and when their passport expires. A passport expiration date will not change and many other travelers will begin submitting new and renewal applications as soon as the travel ban is lifted. It's best to beat the rush and send in your passport now so that you'll be prepared to travel when worries over coronavirus have subsided, Pacella advises.</p><h2>What is the current situation for applications?</h2><p>On March 25, 2020, the State Department declared that applicants could no longer receive expedited passport services unless they had a qualified life-or-death emergency which required international travel within the next 72 hours.</p><p>That regulation was followed on April 3 with <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/passport-covid-19.html">an update posted to the State Department website clarifying </a>that standard passport applications would continue to be accepted, although the department warned of significant delays in processing times.</p><p>Now, as of July 6,</p><p>Pacella told TPG that current turnaround times are uncertain. Routine passport processing is still available through a limited number of passport acceptance agencies, which include select post offices and other government entities such as county or district clerks, as well as private third-party agencies like <a href="http://rushmypassport.com/">RushMyPassport.com</a>.</p><p>Under typical circumstances, standard processing via the State Department takes six to eight weeks to issue or renew a passport. Expedited service through the U.S. Postal Service takes about two to three weeks. <a href="https://www.rushmypassport.com/blog/find-your-closest-regional-passport-agency/">Regional passport agencies</a> in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Houston can expedite passports (in normal times) within one business day, although most say to expect it to take between five to eight business days.</p><h2>I've already submitted my passport application. How can I check on its status?</h2><p>Applicants can sign up for status updates and check their passport status via the <a href="https://passportstatus.state.gov/">dedicated Passport Status</a> website.</p><h2>What if my child needs an updated passport?</h2><p>Every passport application for a minor under the age of 16 requires that the child apply in person at a passport acceptance facility. Both parents must be present with the child or an absent parent must submit a <a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds3053.pdf">notarized consent form</a>. Children 15 and under need new passports every five years.</p><p>Applicants who are 16 years of age must also have both parents present at the passport office when applying for their first adult passport, which is valid for 10 years. However, 17-year-old applicants only need one parent present. Applicants who are 18 or older can apply for adult passports on their own.</p><h2>Can I still apply for a passport at the post office?</h2><p>Because many non-essential facilities are closed because of the coronavirus crisis, many passport application acceptance facilities such as libraries, clerks of court and post offices are not accepting U.S. passport applications at this time.</p><p>As of March 25, 2020, the handful of post offices that still process passport applications are requiring customers to <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/passport-covid-19.html#ExternalPopup">make online appointments</a>. If you need to apply in person for your U.S. passport, <a href="http://iafdb.travel.state.gov/#_blank">contact the facility</a> directly to confirm the status of its operations.</p><h2>Where else can I apply for or renew a passport?</h2><p>There are options in addition to post offices and regional passport agencies. You'll need to visit another "adjudication agency" to apply for a new adult passport, a passport for a child under the age of 16, or when you're replacing a lost or stolen passport.</p><p>To find the nearest facility in your area, <a href="https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/DefaultForm.aspx">use this website and enter your zip code</a> to find the closest facility. Your county or district clerk's office may be able to resolve your passport needs, although Pacella says that it's a good idea to call ahead and confirm that the office which handles passport applications and renewals is still open as an essential service.</p><h2>Should I apply through a third-party passport agency?</h2><p>Normally, companies like RushMyPassport.com excel at turning around passport renewals and new applications in record time. But since the same guidelines set forth by the State Department apply to both personal and business applicants, expedited service is not available through third-party agencies.Nevertheless, a third-party processing agency may still be helpful, if only to ease your mind by handling your document preparations and delivery. Make sure the processing agency you select is an approved partner and courier service registered with the State Department as a hand-carry courier.</p><h2>What circumstances qualify as an 'emergency' for an expedited passport?</h2><p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html">Life-or-death emergencies</a> are serious illness, injuries or a death in your immediate family (a parent, child, spouse, sibling, aunt or uncle) which require you to travel outside the United States within 72 hours (three days).</p><p>To have your passport application processed, you must provide:</p><ul><li>Proof of the life-or-death emergency such as a death certificate, a statement from a mortuary or a signed letter from a hospital or medical professional. Documents must be translated into or written in English</li><li>Proof of international travel (reservation, ticket or  itinerary)</li></ul><p>To make an appointment for an expedited passport, you must call the National Passport Information Center.</p><p>Hours are Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (ET); Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The number is 1-877-487-2778 (1-888-874-7793 TDD/TTY). Outside of these hours, call 202-647-4000 to make an appointment.</p><h2>What if I applied for expedited service?</h2><p>If you applied for a passport and requested expedited service on or before March 19, 2020, the State Department will honor its commitment of a two- to three-week turnaround time, door-to-door. If you applied in-person at a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies.html">passport agency or center</a> on or before March 19, 2020, the passport agency or center will contact you to ask if you want to pick up your passport in person or have it mailed to you.</p><p>Passport applications after March 20, 2020, will are subject to standard processing times. You will not be able to apply for expedited service either directly or through <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html">third-party agencies like RushMyPassport.com</a>, and you will not be able to pay the additional rush fee.</p><p>Puerto Ricans should be aware that the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies/san-juan.html">San Juan Passport Agency</a> is closed to the public until at least April 12, 2020.</p><p>Here are more details from Pacella about the current situation:<b>Third-party passport courier services</b></p><ul><li>This rundown on the current situation <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html">has undergone a lot of revisions</a>.</li><li>Make sure the company you are using is an approved partner and courier service registered with the State Department as a hand-carry courier.</li><li>Only use this service if you are traveling soon and cannot get to a regional passport agency.
