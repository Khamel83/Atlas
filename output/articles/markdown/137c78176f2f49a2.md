<div><p><span>Today it’s pub day for The Pacific Circuit, a book I’ve been working on since Obama was president. I’ve reflected a bit on it in </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/77f0e67c-c7fb-4bed-9526-0ddf457387ad?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08">previous</a><span> </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c05379a6-9f14-4900-8e63-957b4e1d8a24?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08">newsletters</a><span>. </span></p><p>The best part of publishing a book is talking with folks about the thing itself, the process of creating it, and the themes it develops. Many OGC subscribers have been following my work for … a very long time. And many of you have influenced the way I think and write. </p><p>Now that the book is available, I’d be delighted to answer any questions you might have about the work in it or how it connects to my other obsessions. </p><p>I was just in Washington, DC, and the cherries were all beginning to bloom. It feels that way in life a little right now, too. Not the end of something, but the beginning. </p><p>Anywhere, here is Substack’s little startup guide for chatting… Hope to see you there.</p><p><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/oaklandgardenclub/chat"><span>Join chat</span></a></p><h2>How to get started</h2><ol><li><p><strong><span>Get the Substack app by clicking </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5069953a-b52b-4574-a11d-cf6017d5927f?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08">this link</a><span> or the button below.</span></strong><span> New chat threads won’t be sent sent via email, so turn on push notifications so you don’t miss conversation as it happens.
