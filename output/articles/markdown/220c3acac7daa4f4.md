## Selected Content

Monets, Munchs and Mondrians: The Art Institute of Chicago has photographed over 50,000 artworks in their collection and made all of them freely available online, in high definition.

In addition to paintings and drawings, there are shots of architectural interiors and exteriors, floorplans, sculptures, writings, objects, draftings and sketches. At press time the site was a little buggy, with some of the images failing to load; but with some 52,446 works and counting to choose from, you're bound to find, for free, something you'd have paid good money to have a print of. Dive in here.
