With 2016 coming to an end, one of the more gratifying ways to take stock is to look back on all that we've cooked—and the recipes we'll pocket to keep feeding each other and ourselves on repeat.

The ten recipes below are the Food52 community's very favorite Genius Recipes of the year. Like every year, comfort foods abound—but this year, they're particularly nourishing, simple, smart ones. The one possible exception is the absurd grilled cheese—and if I were you, I'd make that one first.
