**Folders:** Feedly  
**Description:** The concept for the +x Bookshelf originated as a shelving solution to match the angle of the pitched roof of our firm's office, located in a traditional Beijing courtyard house. From that starting point, People's Industrial Design Office (PIDO) continued to develop +x Bookshelf components into a flexible, modular shelving system with limitless possibilities.

                <p>The bookshelf is oriented diagonally, capable of holding books without the use of bookends. This form comes with a range of new potential uses: its application can be as varied as covering an entire wall or functioning as a freestanding mid-height spatial divider. A wooden base is provided for the freestanding iteration.</p><p>The shelves of the +x Bookshelf are 3mm thick anodized aluminum and come in many different colors. Together, the reflections on the aluminum shelves create a color-blending effect. The shelves can also be inserted with different orientations, allowing for several nodal modulations. The frame of the bookshelf is steel and can be completely flat-packed for efficient shipping. The bookshelf can be assembled simply, by screwing together its various parts. </p><p><i>Material: Steel, Aluminum</i></p>                            </section>
