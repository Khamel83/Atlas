He wore a cowboy hat, which I would’ve considered an affectation but for the Southern California sunshine beating down on him during our Zoom call. Nearby, he told me, were three cows, six horses, six goats, six sheep and about 30 chickens. Mullen, like Old MacDonald, had a farm.</p><p>This threw me. I remembered him as the quintessential It boy of the New York City dining scene just a decade and a half ago — young, handsome, charismatic and savvy enough to carve out a niche by countering the craze for Italian cooking with the traditions and tapas of Spain. He did that in such busy Manhattan establishments as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html">Boqueria</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html">Suba</a>, each of which I gave two stars when I was The Times’s restaurant critic from 2004 to 2009, and Tertulia, which he opened in 2011 and where I ate all the time. I followed him from restaurant to restaurant; I followed him even to the woods of eastern Pennsylvania, where he took me hunting for wild birds, one of which he cooked for me, buckshot and all, at Tertulia the following night.</p><p>But Mullen left New York in 2019, by which point he’d either shuttered or severed ties with all his restaurants. He moved to the Los Angeles area and never looked back, in part because he found that a chef can do and earn plenty without working 90 to 100 hours a week while sweating over stoves and staffing and profit margins and seating charts. He has consulting gigs, sponsorship deals, educational projects and, now, a health-focused, protein-forward meal delivery service that’s based on (and named for) his 2017 cookbook, “Real Food Heals.” He also has the farm, which is really a ranch, located in Topanga Canyon and established not as a business interest but as a way of life. Talking about all of that, Mullen, now 50, professed unsullied satisfaction.</p><p>I, in turn, professed skepticism. Didn’t he miss the adrenaline of a frenzied Friday dinner service, the exhilaration of lordship over a sanctum where, on any given night, Jay-Z and Beyoncé might pop in? What about those precious stars that critics lavished on him?</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I loved it when I was in it,” he says. “But the last thing I’d do right now is open a restaurant.” The <em>last</em> thing? He made it sound like a punishment — like a ruinous dare taken only by masochists and fools who don’t know any better.</p><p>It’s not just him. It’s all sorts of talented, enterprising, creative cooks who used to run restaurants in New York City or will never run restaurants there or have consigned restaurants to minor roles (cameos, really) in culinary careers that sprawl in other, gentler directions. Over recent years, they watched restaurants become more difficult and expensive to operate, while the food world diversified and presented easier incomes and new routes to respect. Back when I was reviewing restaurants, there seemed to be no steppingstone to kitchen glory as reliable as stewardship of a place that self-regarding epicures flocked to and food bloggers gushed over. And it seemed that no one in culinary circles enjoyed the bragging rights — the divinity — that the top restaurant chefs did.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><picture><source><source><source><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/t-magazine/11tmag-chefs-slide-AATC/11tmag-chefs-slide-AATC-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"></source></source></source></picture></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Kimchi nabe with thinly sliced pan-seared pork.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Photograph by Mari Maeda and Yuji Oboshi.

I can think of few food goddesses with a following more worshipful than <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/author/samin-nosrat">Samin Nosrat’s</a>, and she worked only in supporting positions in restaurants in California and Italy. Yet she took what she learned there and elsewhere and wrote the 2017 cookbook “Salt Fat Acid Heat,” which became a best seller, spawned a Netflix series with the same title and made her a star. The James Beard Award-​winning book and show weren’t the fruits of her fame; they were the seeds of it. “I never fantasized that I would be Thomas Keller or Alice Waters or a capital-‘C’ chef,” she says. Nosrat, 44, just wanted to celebrate her food love and share her knowledge — and she correctly envisioned a variety of potential showcases for that. “You don’t have to be the face of a restaurant with customers,” she says.</p><p>To some extent, that’s long been true. Julia Child, James Beard, Ina Garten, even Martha Stewart in her own way: None of them were known for, or achieved their celebrity via, esteemed restaurants. And the dawn of the Food Network in 1993, the debut of “Top Chef” on Bravo in 2006 and the explosion of food television and food reality shows expanded the theaters in which cooks could prove their prowess and make their names; in some cases, as with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/dining/top-chef-season-20.html">“Top Chef” victors or runners-up</a>, the hot restaurant came <em>after</em>, not before, the telegenic slicing, dicing and searing. Social media, too, forged paths to prominence that didn’t run through restaurant kitchens.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But what I’m observing now is more complicated than “Hell’s Kitchen” and Instagram. It’s a broadening recognition of the many creative outlets, lucrative jobs and opportunities to connect with food enthusiasts well beyond restaurants. It’s a world in which the search for — and creation of — distinctive food spreads across a commercial landscape in which restaurants, at least traditional ones, claim a smaller fraction of the real estate than they once did. It’s an economy in which the money and effort that it takes to get a restaurant off the ground and keep it in the black discourage many cooks from even trying. It’s a gain in some ways but a loss in others: Many of the endeavors to which chefs are migrating make it impossible for ordinary food lovers who might have purposely or accidentally shown up at their restaurants’ doors to enjoy their cooking and appraise their talent. These chefs used to place themselves at busy crossroads. Now they tuck themselves into quieter cul-de-sacs.</p><div><section><header><h2>Get the best of The Times in your inbox</h2></header><ul><li><h4>On weekdays and Sundays, we recommend one piece of exceptional writing from The Times — a narrative or essay that takes you someplace you might not expect to go.</h4></li><li><h4>Wake up each morning to the day's top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox.</h4></li><li><h4>A round-up of the best stories personalized to you. </h4></li></ul></section></div><section><div><figure><div><div><div><picture><source><source><source><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/07/t-magazine/holiday-hotline-banner/holiday-hotline-banner-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"></source></source></source></picture></div></div></div></figure></div><p>Ask our editors to find gifts for the hardest-to-please people on your list. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/t-magazine/holiday-gift-suggestions-questions.html">Click here</a> to submit a question by Oct. 18, and we’ll respond to the most intriguing ones in our Nov. 13 and 20 newsletters.

It kept many customers home in 2020 and 2021; some never resumed dining out with the same frequency again. But apart from the pandemic, restaurants have been contending with rising food costs and rents — especially in cities on the coasts and perhaps <em>most</em> especially in New York — and with minimum-wage increases and a movement for better treatment and compensation of restaurant workers. All of that translates into the chicken entree whose $40 price tag flabbergasts most diners but leaves the restaurant owner with barely enough profit to quarter and roast the next hen. Nobody’s happy.</p><p>“It’s the most difficult time to open a restaurant that I’ve ever experienced and, frankly, if I were starting today, I wouldn’t even attempt it,” says Stephen Starr, whose restaurant group operates more than three dozen establishments nationwide, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/le-coucou-review.html">Le Coucou</a> in Manhattan and <a href="https://lediplomatedc.com/">Le Diplomate</a> in Washington, D.C. Starr, 66, does big, splashy ventures, but I got a similar take from Joe Carroll, the owner of the barbecue joint <a href="https://www.fettesaubbq.com/">Fette Sau</a> and the funky, untraditional steakhouse <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/dining/reviews/st-anselm-nyc-restaurant-review.html">St. Anselm</a>, both of which are modestly scaled places in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Carroll, 53, told me that to open St. Anselm in 2010 and then upgrade it the following year, he spent about $260,000 on construction, equipment, furniture and a down payment on rent, which was $4,000 a month. He estimates that getting the project off the ground would cost three to four times as much today — an increase much higher than inflation. When he opened Fette Sau in 2007, his rent was $4,200 a month. Now it’s $16,500. “And that’s after I negotiated it down,” he says. “You’re talking about a 1,200-square-foot cinder-block box.” He sighs. “I understand New York City. I’ve lived here for 30 years. But where does this end?”</p><p>And even if you can scrounge together the money to start a restaurant, can you hang in there long enough for it to recoup its investment? The renowned New York City restaurateur <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/danny-meyer">Danny Meyer</a>, 66, says that a well-run, popular establishment may need up to 10 years to do that — and a minority of restaurants last that long. While there aren’t many reliable figures on the failure rate for restaurants, most knowledgeable restaurateurs believe that fewer than half make it to the five-year mark, and many of the ones that survive longer than that do so only through constant, painstaking budget management. “You have to be like a hawk on top of the margins,” Mullen says. “It’s a game of fractions. Of millimeters.” If you’re not attentive enough to having a few workers clock out early during a slow dinner service, it can be the difference between turning a profit that night or not.</p></div></div><div><div><p>That sort of vigilance eventually ground down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/dining/cooking-for-one.html">Anita Lo</a>, the chef-owner of Annisa, a subtly elegant, deeply loved restaurant in Manhattan’s West Village whose trailblazing contemporary American blend of French techniques and Asian influences inspired many imitators. Lo closed Annisa in 2017 after a 17-year run that included an invitation from the White House to supervise a state dinner that President Barack Obama hosted for President Xi Jinping of China.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><picture><source><source><source><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/t-magazine/11tmag-chefs-slide-5QN3/11tmag-chefs-slide-5QN3-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"></source></source></source></picture></div></div></div><figcaption><span>An array of dumplings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Photograph by Mari Maeda and Yuji Oboshi. Set design by Victoria Petro-Conroy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“We were just getting squeezed,” says Lo, 58, referring to equipment problems, insurance rates and some diners’ resistance to loftier menu prices that merely reflected a no-tipping policy she’d instituted to more fairly pay her staff. Long nights in Annisa’s kitchen had taken a physical toll on her — she had a knee replaced, then two follow-up surgeries to deal with complications. “I literally worked myself to the bone,” Lo says.</p><p>She and I were having lunch at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/dining/restaurant-review-rafs-nyc.html">Raf’s</a>, a relatively new, widely praised Italian French bistro in downtown Manhattan whose 41-year-old head chef, Mary Attea, is Lo’s longtime romantic partner. They worked together at Annisa. Lo rattled off various details about Attea’s career and about Raf’s reception, her voice full of pride but bereft of envy. She’s content to watch from the sidelines.</p><p>She’s content, period, because she has “the best job in the world,” she says. For a company called <a href="https://tourdeforks.com/">Tour de Forks</a>, she co-hosts high-end culinary tours, guiding groups of up to a dozen travelers through the food traditions of a given country or region. She’s done that in Italy, Portugal, Norway and Mexico. As she describes these trips, which include not only choosing restaurants for the travelers but also foraging and cooking with them, it’s clear that she’s interacting with the people she’s feeding in an intimate way that many chefs crave but that’s pretty much impossible in a busy 50-seat restaurant like Annisa. And because the trips happen only every few months, she’s able to visit Bahrain and Saudi Arabia for cooking stints in hotels or concert halls that like to advertise guest appearances by renowned chefs.</p></div></div><div><div><p>She also has downtime. Accomplished chefs seldom used to talk much about that. For a while, the paradigm was Anthony Bourdain circa his 2000 memoir, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/books/review/kitchen-confidential-anthony-bourdain-best-seller.html">Kitchen Confidential</a>,” running fast on the fuel of cocaine. But we’re now in the age of downers, of wellness. Andrew Friedman, 57, who has written books about or with many pedigreed chefs and who hosts the podcast “<a href="https://andrewtalkstochefs.com/">Andrew Talks to Chefs</a>,” says that “the fever broke” about eight years ago “when people started talking about things you never talked about in the restaurant business — like balance and self-care and sleep.” Not coincidentally, he says, he noticed that “traffic completely reversed” and, instead of cooks working as private chefs en route to restaurant kitchens, they went in the other direction. “The private cheffing is through the roof,” says Brandon Hoy, a 47-year-old co-owner of a group of a dozen restaurants that began with the artisanal pizza mecca <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/reviews/robertas-nyc-restaurant-review.html">Roberta’s</a> in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. “Probably 40 chefs who’ve worked in our group are private chefs now — it’s crazy.” They don’t necessarily make more money, he says, but they have much calmer lives. And they never had to establish major public profiles. The whole point is not to get caught up in all of that.</p><p>And if you <em>are</em> a chef with a big or medium-size name, you have many options less stressful, less time-consuming and, in some cases, more financially advantageous than fussing over your Michelin-starred restaurant or presiding personally over a growing empire. Lend your name to restaurants — in airports, on cruise ships, in hotels — that require almost nothing of you. Appear at the food festivals staged all year round all around the world and say a few words and cook some dishes for an adoring, applauding crowd. Develop and put your stamp of approval on packaged goods — that’s what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/dining/david-chang-kojin-toronto.html">David Chang</a> has done. While he still operates several restaurants, they’re a fraction of his Momofuku empire of a decade ago. On the homepage of the Momofuku website, “Restaurants” now get subordinate billing to “Momofuku Goods,” an array of mail-order noodles, spice mixtures, oils, salts and kitchen tools that promise to help you “cook Momofuku magic in minutes.” At 47, Chang’s a condiments king, and he has also written three best sellers and hosted three documentary series and two podcasts.</p><p>Books and television are the 55-year-old chef <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/dining/alex-guarnaschelli-book-cook-with-me.html">Alex Guarnaschelli’s</a> lifeblood. In addition to her regular appearances on “Chopped,” she’s the cynosure of three other Food Network shows: “Supermarket Stakeout,” “Ciao House” and “Alex vs. America.” She’s up to five cookbooks. She’s active on social media, doling out culinary tips. And she can do all of that in fewer hours a week, on average, than it would take to physically run the kitchen at the Manhattan restaurant Butter night after night, which she did decades ago toward the beginning of her career. She remains Butter’s executive chef but isn’t there all the time. Perhaps more than ever, a chef must be someone who walks into a house and announces: “I do plumbing, I do electrical, I can install toilets, I do roofing, I do gutters,” she says. “You become a jack-of-all-trades handyperson.”</p><p>And you never know how and when you might be needed. A few years ago, <a href="https://davidwaltuck.com/">David Waltuck</a>, who was the chef-owner of Chanterelle in downtown Manhattan from its birth in 1979 to its death in 2009, was asked to do something beyond the consulting and private cooking that had occupied him since his restaurant closed. Could he spend a month with an actor who was preparing to play a chef? “It was kind of free-form — like four hours a day in this kitchen they rented, showing him knife skills, showing him how to plate certain things,” Waltuck, 69, says. The actor was Jeremy Allen White. The show was “The Bear,” which recently finished its third season.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><picture><source><source><source><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/t-magazine/11tmag-chefs-slide-TQ1M/11tmag-chefs-slide-TQ1M-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"></source></source></source></picture></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Chicken paillard with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Photograph by Mari Maeda and Yuji Oboshi. Set design by Victoria Petro-Conroy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Waltuck’s currency comes from Chanterelle’s hallowed status. But other chefs who consult or do bespoke versions of catering or are influencers of some kind have, like Nosrat, made their names entirely apart from restaurant work, often thanks to YouTube. That’s the case, for example, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alison-roman">Alison Roman</a>, 39, whose online recipes led to best-selling cookbooks, viral cooking videos and, last year, the opening of a store in upstate New York where she plans to do occasional private dinners. Similarly, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/search?q=Andy+Baraghani">Andy Baraghani’s</a> 2022 book, “The Cook You Want to Be,” which won a James Beard Award, and his status as a so-called video personality are connected not to his brief, early period of kitchen jobs at New York’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-estela-in-nolita.html">Estela</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/dining/reviews/frej-brooklyn-restaurant-review.html">Frej</a> but to his time over the past decade working at Bon Appétit magazine, where Roman, too, made her name, and where an ambitious explosion of content across various media underscored the changes in the food world and who ruled it. “Working in restaurants can teach you a lot of things beyond food — management, efficiency,” says Baraghani, 34. “But when it comes to understanding techniques? You can do that on your own.” And the internet gives the recipe whisperers of the world — Roman, Baraghani, The Times’s own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-clark">Melissa Clark</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-kim">Eric Kim</a> — a potential fan base much larger than a chef at a popular restaurant enjoys. Only so many customers can taste your tuna tartare. There’s no limit to the number who can watch and emulate your ratatouille routine.</p></div></div><div><div><p>THEN AGAIN, IT’S hard to match the high-wire feat of perfectly executed food served at perfectly timed intervals in restaurants where the ballet in the dining room belies the bedlam in the kitchen. Mullen, Lo, Waltuck — they all concede as much, and all acknowledge, too, that the siren song of a restaurant of one’s own will never stop luring many chefs, at least at some stage of their careers. Lo recently had a meal with Annisa alums who’d continued in the business and were in charge of newer establishments that she loves: In addition to Attea, there’s Sawako Okochi (of the Brooklyn restaurant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/dining/reviews/hungry-city-shalom-japan-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html">Shalom Japan</a>), Suzanne Cupps (of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html">Lola’s</a> in Manhattan) and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/q-a-sohui-kim/">Sohui Kim</a> (of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/dining/gage-and-tollner-review.html">Gage &amp; Tollner</a> and <a href="https://www.goodfork.com/">the Good Fork</a>, both in Brooklyn). “I told all of my staff not to open their own restaurants,” she says with a laugh. “It’s kind of awesome that they didn’t listen to me.”</p><p>But my conversations with her, Mullen and other chefs reveal the attractiveness of other possibilities. While many consulting contracts have short time spans and require chefs (or their agents) to hustle to find the next one and the one after that, the pay can be handsome. Starr says that he’s given chef consultants between $15,000 and $25,000 to develop eight to a dozen dishes, teach them to the kitchen staff and implement the systems for their production. “That’s a month or two of part-time work,” he says, noting that an executive chef in a major city working very long hours might earn between $100,000 and $225,000 a year.</p><p>Those full-time restaurant jobs have no monopoly on creativity. The chef <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/t-magazine/yann-nury-summer-recipes.html">Yann Nury</a>, a 40-year-old French transplant to New York who operates what’s in some sense a wildly posh catering business, isn’t only inventing entirely new menus for most of the elaborate, one-of-a-kind events that he stages but is also occasionally designing the spaces. That was the case for a recent 60-guest extravaganza on an Arizona ranch for which he assembled — outdoors — what looked like an indoor dining room, complete with chandeliers. He also hosts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/t-magazine/yann-nury-loft.html">invitation-only dinners in the downtown Manhattan loft</a> where he develops and tests recipes. “I get to create something different for every group of people,” he says, adding that he inhabits “the world of food that I always dreamed of living in.”</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/chefchristinelau/?hl=en">Christine Lau</a>, a New York-based chef who drew praise for her Asian American-​influenced Italian cooking at the downtown Manhattan restaurant <a href="https://www.kimikanyc.com/">Kimika</a> when it opened in 2020, left that job and has spent the past two years consulting and doing pop-up events; that work has taken Lau, 43, to places as distant and distinct from one another as Taiwan and Alabama. And while she could and certainly would be routinely revising the menu at any restaurant that she was running all 52 weeks of the year, she definitely wouldn’t be composing and fine-tuning the expansive range of appetizers, main courses and sides that she is now. “I <em>could</em> be on autopilot and cook the same six dishes,” she says. Instead, “I choose to cook different foods at different events.” She then told a story about preparing 900 portions of char siu quail for a party at the Kentucky Derby this past spring where she had only induction burners — no gas, no fire — for the final stages of cooking. It sounded less like drudgery than like the transfixing solution to a logistical, chemical, even spiritual puzzle.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I have a vision,” says Lau — she wants to mainstream staples of Asian cuisine so that they’re considered fully American, too. She has no idea where she’ll be in one year, five years, 10. She told me she was still figuring that out. There was nervousness in her voice but also a sense of freedom. From my conversations with other chefs who’d left restaurants behind, I could recognize the sound.</p><p>Set design by Victoria Petro-Conroy. Photo assistant: Caleb Henderson.
