If you value convenience, now might be the perfect time to apply for the Capital One® Savor® Cash Rewards Credit Card. Capital One recently added free unlimited membership with Postmates to the card from now until December 2019. A Postmates Unlimited subscription typically costs ~$10 per month, so this new perk is worth $120 if you use it over the next year.

My friend loves Postmates and had already been paying for a monthly subscription to save on delivery fees. When he learned the subscription perk was added to the Capital One Savor card, he applied immediately! He’ll save money on something he was already paying for. Besides the subscription savings, the card also has a valuable sign-up bonus and no annual fee for the first year!

Save Money on Delivery Fees by Applying for the Capital One Savor Card to Get a Free Postmates Unlimited Subscription Through the End of 2019

Postmates isn’t available everywhere, but the delivery service is in most major cities in the US, including Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and several others.

You can get just about anything delivered through Postmates, including alcohol, groceries, takeout, or even essential items from a convenience store. And with a Postmates Unlimited subscription, delivery fees are waived on all orders above $15. Plus, you don’t have to pay for surge pricing during peak delivery times.
