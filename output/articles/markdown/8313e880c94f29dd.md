Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of only about 12%. </p><p>In a phase 1 trial, patients received surgery, a PD-L1 inhibitor, chemotherapy, and a personalized mRNA vaccine. At the 3 year mark, 75% of patients were cancer free. Moreover, responders with vaccine-induced T cells had significantly longer recurrence-free survival compared to non-responders, meaning those that responded to the vaccine went much longer without their cancer coming back than those who didn‚Äôt respond. </p><p>The research shows the vaccine created immune cells that lasted for years, stayed active against cancer, and could help prevent it from coming back. 85% of vaccine-induced T cell clones persisted for at least two years, with a median lifespan of 7.7 years and some projected to last decades. The T cells maintained strong anti-cancer activity and infiltrated recurrent tumors, meaning they could help control cancer over the long term. The study‚Äôs results are extremely compelling evidence that mRNA cancer vaccines can induce durable immunity. </p><p><span>However, the study is not without its skeptics. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/15984b13-74a0-40bb-9b01-e83addfaf426?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vinay Prasad</a><span> pointed out on X that the study had multiple design flaws and that there have been many promising cancer vaccines, but ultimately only one approved by the FDA.

I‚Äôll say it again louder for the people in the back. Gene therapy restored hearing.</p><p><span>Last week, we kicked off the </span><em>Dose</em><span> with two gene therapy wins: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e3cb9ed0-032c-4b39-bf60-bf825deec133?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">restoring a blind man‚Äôs vision</a><span> and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/139e724c-e83d-4bb0-9e47-8f27ad4a495f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">treating a baby‚Äôs spinal muscular atrophy in the womb</a><span>. Now, another gene therapy restored hearing in deaf children. This is a miraculous trend. </span></p><p>Regeneron's gene therapy DB-OTO showed significant hearing improvements in 10 of 11 children in the trial, with some reaching near-normal levels of hearing. Wild. Here‚Äôs how DB-OTO works: the gene therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the OTOF gene into the cochlea, restoring a key protein (otoferlin) needed for hearing. In children with otoferlin-related hearing loss, their inner ear cells detect sound but can‚Äôt send signals to the brain due to a faulty gene. By injecting DB-OTO directly into the cochlea, the therapy enables these cells to produce otoferlin, re-establishing sound transmission and allowing children born deaf to hear. Voil√†!</p><p>Overall the trial not only met but exceeded expectations. Ten of eleven children in the trial experienced significant improvements in hearing. One child, treated at 10 months, demonstrated speech and developmental progress. And best yet, the treatment was delivered in a relatively simple procedure and the children experience only mild and temporary side effects. Hear hear. </p><p><em>From Loyal</em></p><blockquote><p><em>This makes Loyal the likely recipient of both the first- and second-ever RXE acknowledgements from the FDA for longevity drug programs for any species ‚Äî including humans.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ae228b97-e1d7-444f-b038-642341559fda?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_356,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F661d09c6-c317-4dbb-9ac4-5cfd8c35887c_941x1062.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>Loyal is making some big (and small) dog moves!</p><p>The biotech company focused on canine longevity (and R&amp;D that could eventually benefit humans) announced that the FDA granted its drug a ‚Äúreasonable expectation of effectiveness‚Äù in extending senior dogs' lifespans. Loyal still needs the FDA‚Äôs final approval before it hits the market, but the company is still targeting late 2025 availability. The drug, called LOY-002, will be offered to senior dogs of all sizes (or at least &gt;14 lbs). Importantly, Loyal‚Äôs previous programs focused on older, larger dogs and wasn‚Äôt available to smaller and medium sized pooches.</p><p>While Loyal can‚Äôt really yet make claims on lifespan extension, it does comp the drug to a previous study from Purina on caloric restriction that extended dogs lives 2 years. Dogs can‚Äôt be on caloric restriction forever, that‚Äôs not sustainable, but taking a beef-flavored LOY-002 drug may be scalable to millions of dogs.</p><p>Extending the lives of millions of dogs is a good thing. Achieve that and Loyal is not only a valuable company, but likely a very loved company. But the company‚Äôs ambitions don‚Äôt stop at dogs. It wants to build on its learnings in creating canine longevity programs to build human longevity programs. And if they achieve that before others, Loyal is likely one of the most valuable and important companies in the world.

How ‚Äòbout them apples?!</p><p>Apple is committing $500 billion to U.S. investments over the next four years, focusing on AI, silicon engineering, and advanced manufacturing. The scheduled investments include a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, expanded chip production in Arizona, and a doubled $10 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund. The additional investment is expected to add about 20,000 Apple jobs and, in addition, the company is launching a manufacturing academy in Detroit to train workers in AI and automation.</p><p>Why would Apple do this? Besides some obvious genuflecting to the Trump Administration, the move to onshore some of its manufacturing infrastructure to the U.S. is intended to increase supply chain resiliency in the face of increasingly cooled relationships with China.

That may be the case. </p><p>But Apple is the most valuable company in the world ‚Äî by a margin of, coincidentally, $500B ‚Äî and it makes sense for it to continue to invest in its home country, make its supply chains less vulnerable, and (frankly) score a major political win with an administration that values flattery and cooperation above all else.
