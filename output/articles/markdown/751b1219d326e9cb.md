Carved into a cliff some two hundred feet above the road that led from the Iranian plateau to Iraq, its survival had been ensured by its sheer accessibility. The chance to risk life and limb in the cause of deciphering ancient scripts, however, was one that the odd adventurer might positively relish. One such was Henry Rawlinson, a British officer on secondment from India to the Persian court. He first scouted out Bisitun in 1835, scaling the cliff as best as he was able, and recording as much of the inscription as he could make out. Then, eight years later, he returned to the site properly equipped with planks and ropes. Balanced precariously on a ladder, he was able to complete his transcription. ‚ÄòThe interest of the occupation,‚Äô he later recalled, ‚Äòentirely did away with any sense of danger.‚Äô By 1845 Rawlinson had completed a full translation of the section written in Persian, and sent it for publication in London. The Great King Spoke once more.</em></p></blockquote><p>That‚Äôs a long block quote, probably too long for an essay this length.

Or weeps. I don‚Äôt know. It must all seem so easy and weightless to him.</p><p>The point, I hope, is clear. We are getting better at reading the world, just as a book that is entirely illegible to a two-year-old becomes entirely legible to a ten-year-old through improved skill.</p><p><strong>The second reason for Hyperlegibility is the more fascinating one: we are tripping over ourselves to make ourselves easier to read.</strong></p><p>Think Personal User Manuals. Think Tyler Cowen writing for the AIs. Think me, writing this.</p><p>We are game theoretically driven to share more and more of our best ideas, the ones that we might have once exploited in silence.</p><p>Here‚Äôs an example I like that hits close to home.</p><p>Imagine you‚Äôre a small emerging early stage venture capital fund. You‚Äôve noticed something about the market that no one else has. Say you believe that quantum computing is closer than anyone else believes. You‚Äôve identified a handful of promising companies that you want to back.</p><p>What do you do? Do you keep it secret or tell the world?</p><p>Well, what do you need to do in order to successfully invest against your thesis?</p><p>First, you‚Äôll need to raise money from LPs. To do that, you‚Äôll need to spell out as clearly as possible why you believe quantum computing is more investable than everyone else does and which types of companies you think are most investable. Maybe you have a network already, and you can do all of this behind the scenes. Maybe you don‚Äôt, and you need to yell your thesis from the rooftops: blog posts, podcast appearances, conference panels, whatever. One thing a differentiated view can get you is attention. So you trade a secret for the chance at money.</p><p>Assuming you raise, you‚Äôll need to stand out to the companies you want to invest in. This is not the public markets; you can‚Äôt just invest in whatever you choose. They need to choose you, too. Maybe in the early days, you can know everyone ‚Äì go to the conferences, meet them one-on-one, impress them with your insights and with the fact that you believe harder than anyone else does. Does that scale? Do your early investments pay off quickly enough to build a reputation in the community before other investors come in? How do you stand out?</p><p><span>Say you convince companies to let you invest early, you need to help them continue to raise money from downstream capital. </span><em><strong>Which means part of your job is to make quantum legible to the very firms who might one day compete with you.</strong></em><span> Sure, while your category is small, unproven, weird, and risky, they might let you win at the early stage. But eventually, they won‚Äôt. Either way, the proximate issue is getting your companies funded so your investments don‚Äôt go to zero before your ideas have had time to play out.</span></p><p>In all three pieces of your job, you are incentivized in the short-term to make yourself and your ideas Hyperlegible so LPs, founders, and downstream capital can find you. And without the short-term, there is no long-term.</p><p><span>Now imagine this dynamic playing out </span><strong>everywhere</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>My friend </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/32f33155-e830-4a65-b059-0f206cf7b5a2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Tina He</a><span> wrote an excellent essay last week, </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bb8ee6a4-f18d-4280-8086-24ac06d99889?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Jevons Paradox: a personal perspective</a></em><span>.

There‚Äôs something about the growing relative importance of relationships, of ‚Äúhaving a guy,‚Äù of agency and the ability to get things done. There is a reason that all of these ideas have become more popular recently (hint: it‚Äôs Hyperlegibility). There‚Äôs certainly something on the value of </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/db9386c0-573c-41c0-a163-2c6ee61978f0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vertical Integration</a><span>, of how you chain things together to create new forms of value. The ideas in </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/dc6fb999-5cbc-48e6-bc53-a1bfe4952068?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Most Human Wins</a></em><span> are enhanced by thinking about Hyperlegibility. And I am quite certain that the more Hyperlegible most things become, the more people will crave mysteries and </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e023c0c0-7864-42a2-af73-0c65b9810c52?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Return of Magic</a></em><span>.</span></p><p>But for now, I‚Äôll leave you with this: Hyperlegibility is our reality. There‚Äôs no going back.</p><p>There is a generation of people living among us who don‚Äôt feel the same nostalgia for newspapers and ‚Äúnot knowing the answer to something immediately‚Äù that I do, because they never had those experiences in the first place. And they‚Äôre a preview of what happens when you take all of human knowledge as a commoditized input.</p><p>I‚Äôve been talking to more college students recently, and despite rumors of their demise, the kids are very alright. Maybe every generation thinks this, but I‚Äôve walked away from a few recent conversations thinking, ‚ÄúIf I were competing with these people I would be COOKED.‚Äù They‚Äôve somehow read as much as I have but have the faster brains of youth. It‚Äôs a scary combination.</p><p><span>The other day, I asked one of them, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/3623a520-cf3a-43ce-93af-2432ebeacb40?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Malhar Manek</a><span>, why so many of his peers seemed so scarily advanced. His answer was that they grew up on the internet, with access to all of the information imaginable. Not just the fire hose, but the blogs and newsletters and podcasts and YouTube videos that helped make sense of the stream. So it was easy for a relatively curious kid to figure out </span><em>what </em><span>to read to set a baseline, and then, baseline established while the brain is still fresh and curious, to jump off of that base of knowledge to ask their own </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d972e41c-bc79-41a0-ba2a-140c2744ade1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">questions</a><span>. To help answer them, they have all of the internet‚Äôs information, AI, and even one-DM-away access to experts.</span></p><p>I‚Äôd never thought of it that way, because I didn‚Äôt live it. But by making the world Hyperlegible, we helped create a generation of Hyperlegibility-Native Hyperlexics who take as an input the information we worked to turn into an output. And thus civilization evolves and compounds.</p><p><span>A priori, I would have guessed that giving everyone access to the same information would lead to a convergence of goals. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be happening. One of the people I spoke with wants to start a vertically integrated healthcare company, another wants to write a Great Book, and what I‚Äôve heard very consistently from smart college kids is that </span><em>their</em><span> smartest friends are all working on biotech, specifically neuro, specifically </span><strong>brain-computer interfaces</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Which is to say, if you think the world is Hyperlegible now, just wait.</p><p><span>That‚Äôs all for today! If you have a minute, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a925daa3-e733-4060-8c05-a8b49a61d74d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">go get SOC-2 or ISO 27001 compliant</a><span>. </span></p><p>While you do that, we‚Äôll be working hard on a Weekly Dose, and might even drop a new podcast on you in the interim.
