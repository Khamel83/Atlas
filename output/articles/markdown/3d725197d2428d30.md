(To the extent that he ever left‚Ä¶)</p><p>His space company, Blue Origin, successfully launched its New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday morning, reaching orbit and achieving its primary mission objective. The massive 322-foot-tall rocket, which was designed to compete with SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, carried a payload called Blue Ring Pathfinder into orbit, and marked the company‚Äôs official entry into the commercial orbital launch market.</p><p>The launch had two missions ‚Äî first, launch into orbit and second, land and recover the rocket‚Äôs first stage booster. The first mission was accomplished, but Blue Origin did not manage to land the booster. Overtime, however, the company will likely manage to make their rockets reusable and fully compete with SpaceX in the heavy-lift launch market.</p><p>Bezos and Musk, arguably the two greatest entrepreneurs of our generation, are going at it in space. Musk has an early and considerable lead, but I wouldn‚Äôt be quick to countout Bezos. There are really no losers in this race: Jeff and Elon will both be A-OK if they never launch another rocket and everyone else will benefit from these two pioneers racing to colonize space.</p><p><strong>(1a) SpaceX Super Heavy Booster Catch</strong></p><p><em>From SpaceX</em></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6e8e9c78-a261-42bd-9846-4ede0e395e27?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/z_F_PKXxCDE"></a><p>As if on queue, just a couple of hours after I wrote the above section on Blue Origin, SpaceX‚Äôs Mechazilla caught a super heavy booster for the second time.

Earlier this week Japan‚Äôs ispace and U.S.-based Firefly Aerospace launched commercial moon landers aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. ispace‚Äôs Resilience, carrying six payloads, is aiming for a May-June moon landing after a failed 2023 attempt. Firefly‚Äôs Blue Ghost, part of NASA‚Äôs CLPS program, plans to land in March with 10 payloads to study the moon‚Äôs surface.</p><p>The moon‚Äôs resurgent importance is driven by three factors. First, and perhaps more rationally, the moon is seen as a jumping off point for future space exploration, with potential resources like water ice that can support in-space applications, like fuel production. Second, it once again has a certain geopolitical prestige, with both countries and private firms competing to establish a presence on the moon. Third, it is militarily important. </p><p><span>If you‚Äôve read Robert Heinlein‚Äôs </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c461cb2e-65d0-4bc4-8232-905880ae3ab7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a><span> </span></em><span>(and if you haven‚Äôt, you should), you‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs much easier to send projectiles from the Moon down to Earth than to do the opposite. </span></p><p>SpaceX carried these two moon landers, but in just a couple of years, you may see Blue Origin completing missions like this as well.

W-2 carried a payload including a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and a pharmaceutical reactor, designed to advance space-based manufacturing.</p><p>W-2 is in-orbit and commissioned, Varda is in contact with it, and over the next couple of weeks, it will be doing a little in-space manufacturing. Then, it will re-enter, test a spectrometer for AFRL, and land in Australia. That‚Äôll be a g‚Äôday for space. </p><p>The launch was part of The Prometheus program, a partnership between Varda and the AFRL aimed at advancing the latter‚Äôs high-hypersonic systems and reentry technologies. The program is a great example of public, private partnership ‚Äî through 2028 the two organizations are expected to complete dozens of iterative test launches ‚Äî something you can‚Äôt imagine a the AFRL executing without the help of a fast-moving startup like Varda. </p><p>And for Varda, this type of revenue-generating partnership will allow it to advance its tech, learn a ton, and hit necessary milestones on it‚Äôs way towards ultimately making in-space manufacturing and re-entry as common as launch is becoming today.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong><span> </span><strong>Woolly Mammoth, Dodo Get Another Shot as Startup Raises $200 Million</strong></p><p><em>Sarah McBride for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>A biotechnology startup working to bring back animals from extinction has raised $200 million at a valuation of $10.2 billion, more than six times its valuation just two years ago. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/484cb73b-bb2f-4fc4-ad40-bcf1a38ff2f3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Colossal Biosciences Inc.</a><span> is using DNA and genomics to try to </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1ae892cf-cec7-4778-8679-43b2d13c88b6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">resurrect the dodo</a><span>, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a4e31f05-e250-4bfe-a13f-ad2a9d38baa2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Tasmanian tiger</a><span> and the woolly mammoth.</span></em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/157545db-ed3e-447d-9f89-0d5e797691db?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0a6b685-9c6b-46a3-a52f-e0f53af3576f_2000x1333.webp"></a></figure></div><p>Colossal Biosciences has about as ambitious of a mission of any company you‚Äôll come across: use cutting-edge genetic engineering and synthetic biology to "de-extinct" species. To date, the company has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and a $10.2B valuation in order to fund that mission. </p><p>It‚Äôs starting with three species: Woolly Mammoth, Dodo, and Tasmanian tiger. And will be using this funding to hit its target of producing a woolly mammoth calf by 2028. The plan is to splice mammoth DNA with that of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, using advanced CRISPR gene-editing techniques. The resulting hybrid embryos will then be implanted into elephant surrogates. Once born, the plan is for the calfs to be reintroduced into Arctic tundra.</p><p>Which is incredibly cool. Bringing back extinct species is something we humans have dreamed about for centuries in tales, books, and movies. Making it happen opens up a whole pandoras box of possibilities.</p><p>Just because they can ‚Ä¶ does mean that they should. Bring on the Wooly Mammoths!</p><p>But $10.2 billion cool? </p><p>Turns out, it takes a lot of cutting-edge technology to reanimate dead species, and that technology may be valuable to a bunch of customers. Colossal plans to make money by:</p><ol><li><p>Licensing its genetic engineering technologies and tools developed during de-extinction efforts to other companies and researchers for endangered species conservation, gene editing applications in agriculture and livestock, and medical and pharmaceutical applications. </p></li><li><p>Commercializing its computational biology and artificial wombs/embryo development technologies for use in livestock breeding and veterinary medicine, human fertility treatments, and drug development and testing.</p></li><li><p>Creating wildlife reserves and tourism opportunities around their de-extinct species, though this would be further in the future after successful de-extinction</p></li></ol><p>Like space, there‚Äôs something about going as extreme as you possibly can that forces innovation that has downstream value. Investors think the net present value of that value is $10.2 billion. </p><p>That‚Äôs one explanation. The other is that, now that it‚Äôs become basic for billionaires to own sports teams and launch rockets, bringing back the Woolies is the only status left.</p><p><em>Simone et al in World Bank Blogs</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program significantly outperformed their peers who were not in all areas, including English, which was the main goal of the program.

A new study out of Nigeria shows that we‚Äôre on the right path.</span></p><p><span>The pilot program in Edo, Nigeria, used generative AI to deliver personalized, interactive after-school lessons tailored to students' needs and the results were extremely promising.

The program was particularly effective for girls and lower-performing students, helping close gender and achievement gaps.</span></p><p>Importantly, this was a teacher-led initiative. It‚Äôs not like students we‚Äôre handed an AI iPad and given no direction. These results are the outcome of teacher instruction, plus AI-powered teaching tools. This combination of human expert plus AI tool is popping up across many use cases: Engineer + AI Coding Assistant, Doctor + AI Diagnostic Tool, Lawyer + AI Legal Assistant, and the list goes on.

MatterGen uses a diffusion model tailored for 3D materials, generating novel structures by iteratively refining random inputs based on design prompts. It then adjusts atomic positions, elements, and lattice periodicity to meet specified chemical, mechanical, or electronic property constraints. This process means its can generate materials that have specific traits, such as strength, conductivity, or magnetic properties.</p><p>MatterGen is a game changer because it allows researchers to design materials for specific needs, rather than relying on slow trial-and-error methods of material discovery. For example, imagine you work on battery design and you could prompt the model (in very simplified terms): ‚ÄúGenerate a material with high electrical conductivity, low weight, and stability at high temperatures.‚Äù And then you can iterate from there to meet the specific needs of your battery‚Äôs needs.</p><p>MatterGen isn‚Äôt just theoretical.
