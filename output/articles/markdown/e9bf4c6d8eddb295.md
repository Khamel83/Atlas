**Description:** Welcome to Camp52, where we're recapturing the fun of summer as a kid. All month long, you'll find playful, carefree ideas for snacks (s'mores and popsicles, anyone?), drinks, crafts, games, field trips, packing tips, and more.

In our oh-so busy digital world, I’ve found that one of the most relaxing things you can do on vacation is truly disconnect. And what better way to get off the grid than heading out into the woods for a summer camping excursion?

Personally, I love camping (even if I don’t do it as much as I’d like!). There’s something so calming about sleeping under the stars and relaxing in nature—without Wi-Fi or video games to distract you.
 
However, if you’re planning your first-ever camping trip, you might not know what gear to buy and bring with you. Luckily, there are thousands of avid outdoorspeople who are more than happy to share their thoughts on popular equipment. To that end, here’s a list of some of the most highly rated camping gear that’s sure to make your trip a success.
 
First up, you need high-quality sleeping equipment if you’re going to be rested and ready for adventure.

Reviews: 7,000+Rating: 4.4 stars
 
It’s easy to see why this Coleman tent is so popular. It comes in a variety of sizes, sleeping anywhere from two to six people, and even the larger sizes are still incredibly affordable at under $100. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and its rainfly and welded floors will keep you dry, even if the weather outside is soggy.

If you need a more spacious sleeping space, this tent from CORE can accommodate up to nine people or two queen-size inflatable mattresses. It includes a room divider, as well as in-wall storage pockets, and the pre-assembled frame makes it incredibly fast and easy to construct. It’s the perfect option if you’re camping with the whole family!

Don’t feel like carrying an air mattress out into the wilderness? Just bring one of these inflatable sleeping pads instead. They weigh just 16 ounces, so they won’t drag you down, and they’re quick to inflate, unlike full-size mattresses. Plus, they have thousands of glowing reviews—what more could you ask for?

Coleman is one of the go-to camping brands for frequent adventurers, so it should come as no surprise that they’ve pretty much perfected the sleeping bag. This affordable single-person sleeping bag is ideal for snoozing in 40- to 60-degree conditions, as the plush interior will keep you cozy all night long.

Regular pillows are fairly bulky, and they’ll take up quite a bit of space in your car as you pack to go camping. Instead, get a couple of these compressible travel pillows, which roll up into a compact form, allowing you to save space in your bag. They come in a variety of sizes, as well as several adorable patterns.

When You're Trying to Thrive in the Wilderness

Don’t just get by on your camping trip—live your best life! You’ll need these essential tools to avoid bug bites, roast lots of marshmallows, and stay comfy in the woods.
 
Reviews: 1,200+Rating: 4.3 stars
 
Bug spray is an absolute must when you’re camping, as there are sure to be mosquitoes and other biting critters around. Folks swear by this particular bug spray from Repel, which contains 40 percent DEET—the highest concentration available in a spray container. It provides up to eight hours of protection against mosquitoes, ticks, gnats, biting flies, and more, and reviewers say it’s not sticky or too smelly.

Reviews: 4,500+Rating: 4.3 stars
 
Chances are you’re not wearing bug spray to bed, so unless you want to wake up covered in itchy bug bites, be sure to pack some permethrin spray for your gear. When applied to fabrics (such as your clothing, tent, and sleeping bag), this chemical will keep bugs like ticks and mosquitos away. The best part? It lasts for up to six washes or 40 days, so you won’t have to reapply constantly.

Reviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.7 stars
 
Once the sun sets on your camp, you’ll need a few lanterns to illuminate your surroundings, and there’s no better option than this one from Streamlight. These lanterns come in a variety of strengths, ranging from 200 to 1,100 lumens, and they have rings on both the top and bottom for hanging them up. Plus, if you want to light up a larger area, just pop off the top of the lantern and let it shine.

Is your pack feeling a little heavy already? Don’t worry—this handy fire starter won’t weigh you down. The pocket-sized magnesium fuel bar comes with a striker, as well as a compass, all of which you can store on the convenient ball chain. Plus, it will work in wet conditions, ensuring you’re never left out in the cold.

When You're Whipping Up a Woodsy Meal

Just because you’re roughing it doesn’t mean you can’t cook delicious meals. With a stove, some cookware, and a can-do attitude, you’ll be able to eat like royalty.
 
Reviews: 2,000Rating: 4.5 stars
 
All you need to cook your favorite dishes is this two-burner propane stove, which folds up into a super-convenient form for transport. It has pressure-control technology to help provide consistent heat, and it even has wind-blocking side panels so your flame doesn’t go out. It’s basically a gas stovetop to use in the great outdoors!

Reviews: 3,000+Rating: 4.6 stars
 
You probably don’t want to bring your nice pots and pans out into the woods, so invest in this affordable camping mess kit, which includes an anodized aluminum pot, pan, and lid, as well as a number of cooking utensils. The cookware is lightweight and packs up into an easy-to-store bag, allowing you to cook deluxe dinners just about anywhere.

Reviews: 1,500Rating: 4.2 stars
 
There are no fridges in the woods, so you’ll need to bring along a cooler to keep your drinks and food fresh—as well as a lot of ice! This zipperless hardbody cooler comes in several sizes, so you can choose the one that fits your needs, and it even includes a removable shelf to help you keep your grub organized.

When You're Kicking Back and Relaxing

With the sleeping, eating, and bug spraying on lock, don’t forget to pack a few accessories to help you relax and unwind during your trip. It's the best part of the camping experience!
 
Reviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars
 
What’s more serene than hanging out in a hammock and reading a good book? You can make this a reality, no matter where you’re camping, thanks to this portable hammock. It’s made from heavy-duty parachute-grade nylon, and you can set it up anywhere with the included tree straps and carabiners. Reviewers call this product fantastic, especially for such an affordable price.

Keep your relaxation essentials close by with this camping chair, which has a built-in cooler pocket on one side and a mesh storage compartment on the other. The chair also has a fully cushioned seat and supportive back, making it the perfect tool to hang out and take in the scenery.

Reviews: 2,500Rating: 4.3 stars
 
Kayaking is incredibly fun—but kayaks themselves are bulky and hard to transport. That’s what makes these inflatable kayaks such an amazing innovation! This particular model is ideal for lakes and mild rivers, and reviewers say it’s incredibly fun to use and easy to transport. Win-win.

On the shore of a lake? No matter where you are, this inflatable lounger makes it quick and easy to get your nap on. All you have to do is inflate the tube by filling it with air—a process that entails swinging it around like a bubble wand—and once sealed, it becomes the perfect spot for one or two people to lounge. There’s even a built-in head pillow for those times you want a perfect view of the sunset.</p></div></div></div><div><div><img src="https://images.food52.com/biSqVAI6GpM5KtUUfNJ3az2VadM=/8e87332f-55ea-4e71-a753-4ed317d33af1--81DP-NHRCIL.AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=1080&amp;q=75"><div><p>Photo by Amazon</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> 1,100+<br><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.1 stars</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>You can make your campsite a little cozier with the help of this pop-up canopy. It’s 10 x 10 feet and has a durable polyester roof that provides shade (and UV protection) from the sun, and it has telescoping legs that let you set it to three different heights. It’s the perfect spot to eat lunch in the summer or just hang out with your camping companions.</p></div></div></div><div><div><img src="https://images.food52.com/-Uo8PE3UjuNuuWZd7WQmApC5hXs=/2d78e0a5-a1a4-4dc6-bd58-430b00c6296c--8e1f2691-004e-4bcc-b803-fd42f3fe3ca4_1.3fa81c8bbf715ef6bbab65b1dbaabc45.jpeg?w=1080&amp;q=75"><div><p>Photo by Walmart</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> 1,900+<br><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.9 stars</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Sure, it’s a splurge, but this tote bag from YETI is sure to come in handy when you’re out in the wilderness.
