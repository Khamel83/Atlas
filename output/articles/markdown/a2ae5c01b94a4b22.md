Vance as his running mate. In May, Vance sat down for a long conversation with Ross Douthat, an Opinion columnist.</em></p><p>In 2016, J.D. Vance’s best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” made him one of America’s leading interpreters of Trumpism, offering a personal narrative of populism’s origins in working-class disarray.</p><p>In 2024, as a first-term United States senator from Ohio, Vance is arguably America’s leading Trumpist: a staunch ally of Donald Trump, a leading critic of the establishment consensus (or what remains of it) in both foreign and domestic politics, a potential vice-presidential candidate and a likely populist agenda-setter for a second Trump term.</p><p>The Vance of eight years ago was read with appreciation and gratitude by Trump opponents looking for a window into populism. The Vance of today is despised and feared by many of the same kind of people. His transformation is one of the most striking political stories of the Trump era, and one that’s likely to influence Republican politics even after Trump is gone.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I've known Vance since before he assumed either of these identities. For this conversation, I spoke to him about how he sees his own evolution, his relationship to the American elite and to Trump himself, his views on populist economics and America’s support for Ukraine. He also offered a combative (and, to my mind, fundamentally unsupported and unpersuasive) defense of Trump’s conduct after the 2020 election. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><h2>1. After ‘Hillbilly Elegy’</h2><p><em>J.D., the first time I realized that “Hillbilly Elegy,” was going to be a phenomenon was in August 2016. I was in Rockland, Maine, in a cozy little tourist bookstore. I tried to buy the book for my wife, and they said, “Oh, we had four or five copies and they all sold out in the last week.”</em></p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.</p><p>Already a subscriber? <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?response_type=cookie&amp;client_id=vi&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F06%2F13%2Fopinion%2Fjd-vance-interview.html&amp;asset=opttrunc">Log in</a>.</p><p>Want all of The Times? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=89WYR&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F06%2F13%2Fopinion%2Fjd-vance-interview.html">Subscribe</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article>
