<div><div> <h1>How to Party <span>(Without Regrets)</span></h1> </div> <p>Forty-three highly sociable people, from Ivy Getty to Rufus Wainwright, offer tips on how to be a stellar guest and a gracious host.

If there’s some anxiety about it, you have to get into your “people mode” and out of “yourself mode,” which may require changing the channel in your psyche a little bit.

You can be the most beautiful person at the party who brings glamour. You can be the person who brings an expensive wine. Or you can bring a sprinkle — which means you sprinkle joy or wit or personality to a party. You have to bring <em>something</em>.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-harrelson-hgcj/17GETINVITED-harrelson-hgcj-mobileMasterAt3x-v4.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div><p>Sarah Harrelson, left, with the businesswoman Jen Rubio at a party in March.</p>   <p>Jason Sean Weiss</p> </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Sarah Harrelson</span><span>,</span> editor in chief of Cultured magazine</p><p>If you’re going to go, <em>go</em>.

That is <em>rude</em>.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Alex Hitz</span><span>,</span> chef, author</p><p>Bring a sense of humor. Bring positive energy. That anecdote of yours? Cut it by 98 percent, practice it in front of the mirror, and in six months you can bring it to the party.</p><p>If you get dressed for a party, make an effort. You honor your host by making an effort.

One is when you ask the question that should never be asked: “What should I bring?” Instead, you should say, “I’m already planning on bringing some Champagne and wine. What <em>else</em> should I bring?” Or don’t even ask and just show up with something!</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Wes Gordon</span><span>,</span> creative director</p><p>Remember, no matter how nervous you may feel as a guest, the hosts are most likely more nervous and stressed.

It was just a picture of a bunch of people standing in suits and dresses. They’re all having what looks like a very adult conversation, and the bubble above the newcomer is: “Yikes, grown-ups.” I think there’s always a little “yikes, grown-ups” for all of us. So just settle for a minute and then go to the hostess, because your duty, as a guest, is certainly to say hello.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Kristy Hurt</span><span>,</span> headhunter, career coach</p><p>Make three connections. You don’t have to meet every single person, but go into the party and meet three people. Ten words or less.

After a few minutes, it’s polite to excuse yourself by saying you want to refresh your drink.</p> <div> </div></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Athena Calderone</span><span>,</span> interior designer</p><p>Some of my earliest friends in New York remember me as a wallflower. I was so nervous when people would ask me “What do you do?” That was a scary question, because I had yet to define the answer. These feelings can affect your presence in a space. I think it’s important to show up anyway and be who you are.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-gilbert-clbh/17GETINVITED-gilbert-clbh-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div><p>Jennifer Gilbert pours the wine.</p>    </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Jennifer Gilbert</span><span>,</span> event planner</p><p>Stop bringing candles to people’s homes.

Just pretend you remember people, even if you don’t, because it’s just kind. One thing I’ve noticed is that people in New York sometimes pretend <em>not</em> to know you, even if they do, whereas people in D.C. pretend to know you, even if they don’t.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-BRONSON-wlfm/17GETINVITED-BRONSON-wlfm-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div>   <p>Gary Jackson</p> </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Bronson van Wyck</span><span>,</span> event planner, author</p><p>The best way to make a bad impression is to complain. You may think you’re bonding with another guest by complaining, but that’s a cheap bond. You’re not adding anything when you say something like, “Can you believe how long it took to get here?”</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Impana Srikantappa</span><span>,</span> investment executive</p><p>Relax. Everything is going to be fine. If you operate with the mind-set of “everything is going to be fine,” then everything is going to be fine. But if you stress out, then everything is going to stress you out.</p></div> </div></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>3</span></p> <div><h2>How to Converse</h2> </div><p>It seems to come down to listening and asking questions — and resisting the temptation to make it all about you.</p></div> <div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-gohar-cphf/17GETINVITED-gohar-cphf-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div>  </figure> </div><p><span>Laila Gohar</span><span>,</span> culinary artist</p><p>I have this theory that dinner guests fall into two different categories: “characters” and “glues.” Characters are big personalities, the life of the party. They are conversation-starters. Glues are good listeners. They’re soft-spoken and hold conversations together. You need the right balance. Too many characters will start competing for attention. Too much glue and things can get boring. When I put together a guest list, I think of it like casting a movie.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Susan Gutfreund</span><span>,</span> socialite</p><p>A good dinner party is where you mix people up. You mix them up, and you pray it’s going to work like a horse race — you pray it’ll go down to the end, to the wire.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Josh Flagg</span><span>,</span> real estate agent, TV personality, author</p><p>If somebody’s having a bad day, I get it. And if you make it the topic of conversation for the entire dinner party, that’s fine — you just won’t be invited again.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Bronson van Wyck</span></p><p>This is one of the top three things a great guest can do for a host: Figure out the person who knows the fewest people or is the most socially awkward, and go talk to them for five minutes. They’re there because the host cares about them, presumably. And the host wants this person to have a nice time. You can help make that happen!</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-tucci-fqgp/17GETINVITED-tucci-fqgp-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div>  </figure> </div><p><span>Max Tucci</span><span>,</span> restaurateur</p><p>A good guest is someone who shows up authentically and doesn’t try to be someone else. Name-dropping, being affected, social-climbing — leave all that at the door.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Sara Ruffin Costello</span><span>,</span> hotel designer, advice columnist</p><p>I have a friend who talks <em>a lot</em>. People are excusing themselves to go to the bathroom when they get stuck with her. Try listening. When in doubt, try David Sedaris’s bizarre conversational icebreakers. “How long have you known your dentist?” You have to have a certain personality to pull that off.</p> <div> </div></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Alex Hitz</span></p><p>A party is not a therapy session. No one wants to hear your problems at a party. There’s the terrible renovation story that no one wants to hear. And no one wants to know what’s wrong with you physically. They’ll call you a bore. Tell a joke or two. Tell everyone they look great.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/23/multimedia/17GETINVITED-hotchkiss-cqtv/17GETINVITED-hotchkiss-cqtv-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div><p>Steven Badius, a friend of Kyle Hotchkiss Carone, is captured mid-party.</p>   <p>Kyle Hotchkiss Carone</p> </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Kyle Hotchkiss Carone</span></p><p>There is a specific skill that is probably just charisma, but it’s when you know how to meet the energy of the person or group you are chatting with. I hate being asked very specific questions. Tell me a story. If it’s interesting, I’ll tell you one back. And around and around we’ll go.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Kendall Werts</span></p><p>“Real Housewives” is always a good source of conversation, because these people aren’t real, but they remind you of people in your own lives. You can’t go wrong talking about scandals and celebrities. I hear a lot of things out there on the streets. People love to hear about that. It’s very Truman Capote. People want to drink the tea.</p></div> </div></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>4</span></p> <div><h2>Party Etiquette</h2> </div><p>Smartphones, social media, food, footwear and punctuality were topics that came up when our interviews touched on party don’ts.</p></div> <div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-goyal2-jhqz/17GETINVITED-goyal2-jhqz-mobileMasterAt3x-v4.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div>  </figure> </div><p><span>Maneesh Goyal</span></p><p>Never show up early, because the host is always frantic and needs that last half-hour.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Bronson van Wyck</span></p><p>Show up 15 minutes late. Even the best host or hostess appreciates that grace period. It’s beyond priceless.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Jennifer Gilbert</span></p><p>Don’t go walking into somebody’s house and automatically think you can smoke. Ask. And don’t bother the host in the kitchen.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Romilly Newman</span><span>,</span> chef, food stylist, social media personality</p><p>Don’t bring a guest to a seated dinner. People just say, “Oh, can I bring my amazing friend?” And it’ll be 20 minutes before.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-gardner2-cpmf/17GETINVITED-gardner2-cpmf-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div>   <p>Raul Tovar/Houses &amp; Parties</p> </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Rebecca Gardner</span></p><p>Please don’t ask people to take off their shoes when entering your apartment. It’s rude.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Romilly Newman</span></p><p>When you invite people into your home, you need to let go. You can’t be like, “You can’t touch this” and “You have to take your shoes off” and “If you spill something, you are in trouble.” Hosting is letting your guests enjoy themselves.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-hitz-ktfw/17GETINVITED-hitz-ktfw-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div>  </figure> </div><p><span>Alex Hitz</span></p><p>Do not tell your host what you can or cannot eat. Your host is not an airline or a short-order kitchen.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Max Tucci</span></p><p>For hosts, don’t assume people are <em>not</em> allergic to things. Ask if there are any food allergies from the beginning. Emily Post would never have said that, but in the climate we’re in today, it can change the whole night.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Susan Gutfreund</span></p><p>You have to be responsible. This one is a vegetarian, which is a new thing in today’s world, versus the old days, where you just served a meal. Today, you have to be very aware — vegetarian, vegan, all these things. And you do the best you can.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17GETINVITED-Gilbert-gkwh/17GETINVITED-Gilbert-gkwh-mobileMasterAt3x-v4.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div>  </figure> </div><p><span>Jennifer Gilbert</span></p><p>As a hostess, always have something vegan, because the whole world is funny about food now. There should be a gluten-free, dairy-free vegan option, because if people don’t tell you beforehand, you’re like, “Here’s some lettuce.” They’re sitting there with an empty plate, and you feel terrible.</p></div> </div> <div><div> <div>  <figure>  <div><div> <div> <picture><source><source><source> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/23/multimedia/17GETINVITED-tucci2-wfgt/17GETINVITED-tucci2-wfgt-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg"></source></source></source></picture></div></div> </div> <div><div><div><p>Max Tucci and the model Fatou Jobe celebrate their birthday, Feb. 14, at Delmonico’s, one of his New York restaurants.</p>    </div></div> </div> </figure> </div><p><span>Max Tucci</span></p><p>If you’re going to have a sit-down, I love name cards. Now, my trick for name cards is to write the name on <em>both</em> sides, so if someone’s sitting at the table and doesn’t know the other person, they can read the name.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Rufus Wainwright</span></p><p>In Europe, it’s very gauche at a dinner party to sit next to your husband. You have to sit with somebody else. They never seat married people together.</p> <div> </div></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Lela Rose</span><span>,</span> fashion designer</p><p>I never sit spouses together. You see your spouse all the time.</p></div> </div> <div><div><p><span>Maneesh Goyal</span></p><p>There is nothing worse than a guest who is on their phone.
