**Description:** Each year, millions of Americans pack their bags, some heading off in search of adventure and discovery, others to find some much-needed peace and relaxation. For those looking to avoid the crowds and get back to basics, perhaps a less traditional lodging option is a better idea, especially one that playfully reinterprets the treehouse of your childhood, resulting in a whimsical — and slightly nostalgic — take on luxury accommodations. With eco-friendly construction and unique design elements, hotel owners have branched out and created fully functional, and sometimes quite posh, escapes in the sky. If you’re ready to go out on a limb (pun intended), grab a friend with a sense of adventure — and, preferably, not a fear of heights — and get ready to literally elevate your next vacation!

1. Secluded Intown Treehouse

Location: Atlanta, GA

Price: From $375 per night

Where to book: Airbnb.com

With more than 230 guest reviews and an average rating of five stars — seriously — it’s no surprise this treehouse was Airbnb’s 2016 most wished-for listing worldwide. Located just outside Atlanta, the host estimates a drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) will take between 16 and 55 minutes, depending on the traffic.

The treehouse is split into three separate spaces — a living room, bedroom and deck. The bedroom has one rolling double bed that can be positioned inside the room or pushed onto a small deck that overlooks a nearby stream. Such tranquil and picturesque settings make this the perfect getaway for couples.

The bed can be rolled out for an enhanced view. Image courtesy of Airbnb.
The simplicity of it all is what guests seem to enjoy the most. Despite its close proximity to downtown Atlanta, the property is quiet, secluded and relaxing. It’s important to note that this treehouse is intended only for one or two guests. Any other requests must be made prior to booking and are rarely approved; the house is known and remembered for its tranquil aura, an impression the owners would like to maintain.

2. Treehouse Point 

Location: Issaquah, WA, about 30 minutes from Seattle

Price: From $290–$390 per night, depending on the unit

Where to book: TreehousePoint.com

Treehouse Point is a collection of six different treehouses, each with a slightly different flavor. The largest, Upper Pond, features a double bed along with two twin bunks, while the remaining five cabins have just one double bed. Because of the cozy, quiet and romantic nature of the property, guests younger than 13, as well as dogs and other pets, are not permitted.

Upper Pond is beautifully situated among the trees. Image by Adam Crowley.
For guests requiring a private bathroom, Treehouse Point may not be for you. While only one of the treehouse units has a flush toilet and sink, all guests have access to three full-size shared bathrooms, which, of course, can be locked for privacy.

The Trillium treehouse features a loft-style design. Image by Adam Crowley.
While the units themselves are quite small and only feature a couple of chairs and a small table, guests are encouraged to use the on-site lodge, which offers complimentary Wi-Fi, games, afternoon tea and snacks.

It is important to note that because of recent landslides near Highway 1, the best way to access the property is by helicopter — the Escape Through the Skies package is available for guests staying two nights and includes round-trip transportation for $250 per person, while guests staying three or more nights will have their helicopter fees waived completely.

The deck has custom wooden seating for two. Image courtesy of Kodiak Greenwood.
5. Rustic and Romantic Treehouse in Sonoma Wine Country 

Location: Petaluma, CA

Price: From $208 per night

The Lofty Lookout Treehouse appears to be a favorite, with its double-size heart-shaped Jacuzzi, wood-carved king-size bed and wraparound deck that comes with a gas barbecue grill. We would never be so presumptuous as to tell you where to take a second honeymoon, but if the shoe fits…

The property uses multiple sustainable design elements, including a system that collects natural rainwater, locally sourced materials and a red cinder pathway. The interior design makes use of natural lighting and white linens to create a “cloudlike aura” that guests claim is deeply rejuvenating.

The upstairs bedroom has huge windows that allow light to fill the room. Image courtesy of Airbnb.
This tropical escape is completely off the grid and generates its own solar electricity. It should be noted that due to its remote location, guests should expect to encounter insects and hear natural noises of Hawaiian wildlife throughout the night. Sleep easy though, as there are no snakes in Hawaii.

A swinging bed is located on the ground floor beneath the loft bedroom. Image courtesy of Airbnb.
11. Free Spirit Spheres 

Location: British Columbia, Canada

Price: From $175–$314 CAD (~$141–$353)

Where to book: FreeSpiritSpheres.com

While the last property isn’t in the US, the unique spherical design of these suspended sleepers was too unique to keep off the list. The property is extremely remote and will require a nearly four-hour drive — and a ferry ride — from the nearest major city, Vancouver, in British Columbia.

Free Spirit Spheres. Image by K.Kemsley.
Free Spirit Spheres has three units named Eve, Eryn and Melody, which are priced based on occupancy and the number of nights you stay.
