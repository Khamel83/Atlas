This one feels weird. Machines that can think like we can.</p><p><span>Recognize this: </span><strong>even cognitive commoditization is not new</strong><span>.</span></p><p>We do it to each other. Whoever operates at the higher layer uses others’ work as input.</p><p>Raise your hand if you know who Marcel Grossmann is. A few physics fans in the back. I see you. For everyone else, here’s a little story.</p><p>In 1907, Albert Einstein had what he would call his “happiest thought,” born of his very human intuition: “The gravitational field has only a relative existence… Because for an observer freely falling from the roof of a house - at least in his immediate surroundings - there exists no gravitational field.”</p><p>For the next four years, he struggled to turn that happy thought into a coherent theory. Simple mathematics couldn’t deal with the audacity of his insight. Specifically, simple mathematics couldn’t handle the accelerating reference frames that he imagined.</p><p>In 1912, he took a professorship in theoretical physics at ETH Zurich, where he reconnected with an old mathematician classmate: Marcel Grossmann.</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/8115516c-6164-4641-8960-ac4d1ede7f45?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F080e4d65-c481-41e4-844a-0463129de24c_908x360.png"></a></figure></div><p>It was Grossmann who realized that Riemannian geometry and tensor calculus, both of which existed purely in the world of pure mathematics because physics hadn't yet had a need for them, might do the trick. God doesn’t play dice: he had the math waiting when Einstein needed it, and Grossmann to bridge the gap.</p><p><span>They bridged the gap in 1912 and 1913. The two wrote a paper together, “</span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1c9ca0bd-9c40-4d9c-8601-e1c5fc7b0f50?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Entwurf</a><span>,” coming close to General Relativity (GR), but the equations weren’t quite right yet.</span></p><p>Grossmann went back to his work. Einstein spent the next two years struggling with various versions of the field equations, trying to make it tie out. For a time, the math was so hard that he went back to simpler approaches.</p><p>In 1915, he realized that he had to stick with the tensor approach, worked intensely for a few weeks, and finally arrived at the correct field equations of GR. He presented them to the Prussian Academy of Sciences over four weekly lectures.</p><p>Einstein unlocked the universe.</p><p><span>For more than a century, GR has passed every experimental test thrown at it, often with remarkable precision. Even ideas that seem to break the known laws of physics may just be engineering skill issues. In 2010, Hal Puthoff wrote a paper, </span><span> that suggested that observations of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs, or what we used to called UFOs) – things like time manipulation, faster than light travel, and antigravity – can all fit with within GR.</span></p><p>Einstein commoditized Grossmann, in a way. He used Grossman’s output as his input, while he himself provided the spark that could not be reduced, the intuition, and the drive to see it through for nearly a decade, a drive perhaps only possible if you yourself experienced the spark.</p><p>“Commoditized” is not a knock against Grossmann.</p><p>Einstein’s intuitive gift was made more valuable by the commoditization of its complement: the mathematics required to turn it into a theory. Without Grossmann, you may not know Einstein.</p><p><span>We imagine the word </span><em>commoditized</em><span> as an insult, but </span><em>rare </em><span>commodities can be very valuable indeed. Give me an ounce of Rhodium, even a </span><em>gram</em><span> of Painite, Tritium, or, better, Californium any day.</span></p><p>If you look up “commodity” in the dictionary, you’ll find this secondary definition: “something of use, advantage, or value.”</p><p>At the time Grossmann constructed the mathematical bridge that made General Relativity reachable, his mathematical ability was a very rare commodity indeed. You had to be Albert Einstein and hold a professorship at ETH Zurich to access it. If Grossmann’s mathematical talent was a commodity, it was Rhodium ($20,880 per ounce) than Chlorine (8 cents per kg).</p><p>What is fascinating is that, now, 113 years later, math is becoming Chlorine.</p><p>I just had this exchange with o1 pro:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e178844e-2cef-4304-bc32-20e4cd57f326?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1904,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1fcb8f8-2100-4a9c-80fd-4a226404d54f_952x279.png"></a></figure></div><p>I told it I was Einstein, gave it my happiest thought, and asked it to help me with the math.</p><p>It did, in a couple minutes. Marcel Grossmann, included in a $200 per month subscription.</p><p>Of course, it has the benefit of knowing what Grossmann did. And Grossmann himself made an intuitive leap; it was not obvious that Riemannian geometry and tensor calculus held the key. o1 pro did not have to make that same leap. It just had to do some math.</p><p>But the trend is clear: answers to even very hard questions are becoming cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. Which means the ability to ask them is getting more and more and more valuable.</p><p>In other words, the cheaper Grossmann becomes, the more valuable Einstein becomes.</p><h3><strong>A Strategy Memo for Humans</strong></h3><p>This is very good news or very bad news depending on your skills and aspirations.</p><p>What is clear, though, is that it is not a simple situation.

It started as a normal strategy essay.</p><p>I had six strategies companies have historically used for dealing with commoditization at one layer of the stack – similar to those in the One Strategy section – and that was pretty much going to be the payload.</p><p>The idea was simple:</p><ol><li><p>Some human skills are being commoditized.</p></li><li><p>Things get commoditized all the time.</p></li><li><p>Here are the strategies that people and businesses have used to compete.</p></li></ol><p>Even that idea was an evolution. I started thinking about something like this piece over the break, but it was a different idea then. Something about how I was planning to approach 2025 differently as a window into what I think will be a particularly crazy year: less scheduled, because you want to be long optionality into increasing volatility, for example. There was going to be something about writing fewer, deeper pieces, and about leaving room to experiment.</p><p>I probably have eight or nine drafts of different versions of this thing. I’ve been working on them for the past three weeks. I was going to send on the 7th, then the 14th, even yesterday. But the drafts weren’t right, so I didn’t send.</p><p>I guess I will write about those other things I was going to write about now, because they’re pertinent.</p><p><span>Last year, I might have just hit send on a polished version of one of those earlier drafts. Everything was set up to do that: we booked sponsors into individual dates, and had a packed calendar. (Awesome work, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a8176a24-9030-4b32-a3c8-7b6acdb265cf?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Nancy</a><span>!) I wouldn’t have sent anything I wasn’t proud of, but I would have slammed coffee and sprinted to the deadline. I can’t tell you how many essays I reworked starting at 4am on Tuesday morning last year. And it worked well enough; I was happy with last year’s writing, though it can always improve.</span></p><p>For 2025, though, I wanted to give my essays more room to breathe. I want more time to go really, really deep on Deep Dives. And I want weirder ideas to have time to evolve.</p><p><span>One thing we did was change how we do sponsors. We now have three presenting sponsors for 2025 that I’m honored to be telling you about more consistently: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/34b11119-103d-478c-92df-7483b5f6f4a8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Rox</a><span>, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a8e5581f-0586-4abf-89b4-990bc25dd04d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Ramp</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/107139b3-c287-48f1-b3ff-934c900e8b55?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vanta</a><span>. If you need sales, finance, or compliance – and every company does – go say thanks to them to kick us off on the right foot. Importantly, they don’t have set dates. Whenever I send an essay, one of the three will sponsor it. So if a piece just isn’t there, I don’t hit send.</span></p><p>I have to be honest. Not sprinting against a deadline felt weird. I moved out of the home office and into a real office for the first time in five years at the beginning of the year, and it’s quiet. I thought maybe it was too quiet to be productive. It felt lazy not getting anything out.</p><p>At the same time, though, just getting things out is no longer valuable, to the extent that it ever was. Or, it’s less valuable than ever. Even pretty good writing is commoditized.</p><p>So I kept banging my head against this piece, trying to write something that wasn’t just slop, even good slop. Trying to write something unique on a topic a lot of smart people (and even more smart AIs) have written about.</p><p>I meditated a lot, too. I’ve meditated every day for the past 45 days, since the day I decided to start meditating. Some days for as few as 10 minutes, some for as many as 90. For the first time in an adult life of trying to meditate because I thought I should, this time actually feels like something in my brain is changing, even if it’s subtle.</p><p><span>That, too, weirded me out! I’ve been worried that I’ve gotten too chill and detached, that I’d “one shotted” myself as the kids say. I haven’t felt very stressed, when in the past, not sending anything for a few weeks would have really stressed me out. But </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/13172381-7bc4-4c3c-8fe8-1f6054a1cb7e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Trust the Process</a><span>, as they say.</span></p><p>Then last week, something interesting started happening.</p><p>On Friday, I came into the office, meditated, and then had the insight at the beginning of this piece: niti niti economics.</p><p><span>On Saturday, on my commute in, I decided to go no headphones and just let myself think. I’ve also been reading a bunch of seemingly random things and letting them clank around my brain, including </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/abf45942-947e-4691-9225-f0ef9dcf81d7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">There is No Antimemetics Division</a></em><span> and the </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/16975653-21e9-4547-a80f-693502fd099a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">CIA Reading Room</a><span>. While I was walking and thinking, another idea hit me: do an old-school memo. The memorandum linked above is the result.</span></p><p><span>Then on Monday, I commuted without headphones again, and as I was about to get into the subway, a final idea struck: that in the end, what all of this is for is to maximize novel human experience, relations, and love. That one clearly came from the work I did for </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/989a1654-a693-43d8-b5c2-d467489c3be9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Return of Magic</a><span> </span></em><span>and related reading over the break, but it struck me like a bolt that that’s the economic end game, too. That we want to live longer and travel further and accumulate more resources in order to experience more of what it means to be human. When you strip it all away, that’s the uniquely human thing, and something that even the best competition can’t take away.</span></p><p>I stopped, recorded the idea into Claude, asked for feedback, and chatted the whole way in, working on the idea, refining it, beating it up. When I got into the office, I incorporated it into the piece, then kept refining, adding, cutting. All the way, both Claude and ChatGPT provided feedback, some useful, some less so. The feedback I dismiss the most quickly is the feedback that tries to add too much polish. I want this one to be weird.</p><p>I even got their help writing out mathematical proofs for some of the ideas in the piece, something I simply never would have included before but can now, practically for free. I’m not sure it adds too much, besides a little Grossmann callback, but it’s a newly commoditized ingredient that I can throw in the mix. I don’t expect it to become a constant.</p><p><span>Anyway, I’m not sure this essay is strictly </span><em>better</em><span> than anything ChatGPT or Claude or DeepSeek or Grok will be able to write in a year, but it’s certainly different. And personally, the experience of those AHA! moments and the realization that strategy and religion/mysticism point to the same truth were experiences worth having. I hope reading them is a good experience.</span></p><p>Now I’ve written it. These ideas are now a commodity. Take them, remix them, incorporate them, build on them, or even throw them out, leave them sitting in the back of your head until they might be of use.</p><p><span>This will be a theme of 2025. Understand what was formerly scarce and is now commoditized. Don’t shrink from it. Play with it. Experiment. See what it can do that you used to have to do. Learn what </span><em>you </em><span>can do with it that you couldn’t before.</span></p><p><span>At Not Boring, we’re going to experiment a ton. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5b16cf64-3d87-4da7-bcba-8a195ad819b5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Aman</a><span> and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/373129f2-e7bb-468e-a14b-7387fa9f498b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Sehaj</a><span> are cooking up new tools, like the agents behind </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/8508114d-cb81-4910-974e-7e26ab4dead3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Boring News</a><span>, </span><em>and </em><span>the three of us are coming up with ideas for things we couldn’t have previously done without them. We want to use more compute per person than any other fund.  </span></p><p>A framing I’ve found helpful, and maybe you will too, is that there exists out there the one thing that would be the best we could accomplish this year. There is one investment that will turn out to have been the best investment we could have made. There is one essay that is the best essay only I could write. Discovering and executing on those are the mission, and whatever inputs we can use to achieve it, we should. </p><p>That’s the fun thing about getting to be alive right now. If you’re open and curious, you’ll be able to do more, and learn more about yourself, than has ever been possible. </p><p>Don’t let the machines get you down. Make them lift you up. </p><p><em>Thanks to Claude and ChatGPT for editing and input.</em></p><p><em><span>And thanks to our 2025 Presenting Sponsors who make deeper explorations like this possible: </span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/34b11119-103d-478c-92df-7483b5f6f4a8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Rox</a><span>, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a8e5581f-0586-4abf-89b4-990bc25dd04d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Ramp</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/107139b3-c287-48f1-b3ff-934c900e8b55?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vanta</a></strong><span>.
