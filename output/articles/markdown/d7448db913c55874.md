To wit, [untitled] just crossed 10k paying subscribers and each month, over 100k musicians and their teammates use the product. </p><p>And it‚Äôs starting to own a workflow in an era when most of the good workflows are already owned. </p><p>Put differently, ‚Äúmobile‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúwhy now?‚Äù for a product built in the 2020s, but for [untitled], it has been. </p><p>Part of the reason, perhaps, is that AI is changing who can make music and how.

It‚Äôs building something that works for mainstream artists and underground producers alike, something that both captures and expands the market. It's a balancing act rare in music software, where tools typically either cater to professional studio engineers with complex, feature-laden interfaces, or offer watered-down consumer versions that serious artists won't touch. </p><p>Ocean famously takes his time between releases, disappearing for years to perfect his work, then emerging with something that somehow exceeds the endless anticipation. The [untitled] team shares this obsession with craft - Dancho and Jos√© spent years iterating on the product until it felt right, initially frustrating investors who wanted faster deployment cycles. But like Ocean, when they finally shipped, they had built something artists fell in love with. </p><p>In an industry often forced to choose between artistic integrity and commercial success, [untitled] wants to achieve both. In a software landscape that‚Äôs been overplaybooked, [untitled] wants to craft a product that feels like art. </p><p><span>Dancho and Jos√© now have the $$$ to do that, to the tune of an </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/2eaa9dd5-1045-4f71-8471-57a8a54bc356?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">$18 million Series A</a><span> led by Anish Acharya and Olivia Moore at a16z. </span></p><p>Can you mix music and money?

Sounds a bit ridiculous, but we come from a Mexican community that immigrated from Mexico City to San Diego. Our parents knew each other from Mexico City. Our great grandparents, actually, we found out recently, used to be friends, and they used to go to the park together. We became really close over the fact that we're both the youngest of three siblings. Our older brothers were a huge inspiration for us musically. All of our older brothers were really obsessed with music. They were even in bands together. His brother used to drive my brothers to the concerts in San Diego.</span></em></p><p><em>To add to that, we also grew up like eight minutes away from each other, and developed very similar interests.

And then Dan's like, ‚ÄúI'm thinking about a way to be able to create your own clothing, like a fashion app, where I can just put in my own design, and then get that clothing shipped to my house.‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúYeah, that sounds like a really cool idea.‚Äù We just kind of kept chatting from there. </span></em></p><p><em><strong>Dancho</strong><span>: That's the start of our book.

Back to Lisa Marie (emphasis mine): </p><p><em><strong>Lisa Marie:</strong><span> When did the idea for [untitled] first come into existence?</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Dancho:</strong><span> As we said, we've been obsessed with technology since we were kids, and we've been obsessed with music since we were kids. By the time we were in college, we were working with startups. So that's kind of like what we were doing professionally. We were doing internships, doing all that stuff, just trying to break into the tech world. In parallel, we started getting re-obsessed with music now as not just consumers, but actually making music. </span><strong>During my sophomore year of college, Jos√© started making music and he started sending it to me, and I was like, ‚ÄúDamn, this is cool.‚Äù</strong></em></p><p><em><span>He was making these awesome beats on his phone, and was sending them to me just for fun. </span><strong>I also started dabbling in making music on GarageBand.</strong><span> Around this time, Jos√© also introduced me to </span><strong>BROCKHAMPTON</strong><span>, who were a huge inspiration for us ‚Äì seeing all these </span><strong>kids who were just making music in their bedroom.</strong></em></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/38745a55-a71f-445d-859b-2b483a736b7d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/sZd-t5-I5uA"></a><p><em><span>Around the same time, we both had started to get some experience with helping out our friends who made music. My older brother is a musician, so I was helping him out with his group.</span><strong> As we got deeper into this world we became really frustrated with the tools that existed for that entire process. Especially coming from the startup world, we're so used to all these incredible productivity tools that exist for all these different industries. You have tools like Notion, you have tools like Figma, you have all these productivity tools.  In music it just felt like there weren't really beautiful tools built to help artists nurture and maximize their creative process. We decided that we wanted to build a company that had that at the core of its mission. So we built [untitled].</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Jos√©:</strong><span> I think Dan and I realized that </span><strong>music is a four dimensional form of communication</strong><span>. It's just a way of communicating between one person and another. Sometimes friends send each other music. It's easier than sending like a 30 sentence paragraph over text on how they're feeling. You could just send a song and then immediately understand how they‚Äôre feeling.</span><strong> We all tend to think about music as this thing that you release to the world, but in reality, there's a lot of music being sent just between close friends. In fact, if an artist is releasing maybe, let's say, ten albums over the course of their career, which is maybe like 100 - 200 songs, then they've definitely made over 10,000 songs</strong><span>. A lot of that music gets sent to just a few people, whether it's your mom, your significant other, whatever. </span></em></p><p><em><span>For musicians, I think there's this pressure for the music that's released on DSPs. In reality, </span><strong>the other 9000 tracks that you haven't released are very valuable. They have intrinsic value. They have the spiritual value of your emotions, of who you are as a person. Artists shouldn't feel like they are beholden to experiencing their music in a predefined way. Sometimes fully materializing a song is just sending it to your mom or sending it to your friend or sending it to your bandmates. Right now, the mainstream concept of fully materializing your music is putting it on Spotify or on Apple Music.</strong></em></p><p><em><span>We saw this gap between the DAW and the DSPs. In the DAW, a song feels like it's still being worked on in terms of editing and production. On DSPs, it feels like it's already a finished product. </span><strong>We saw this space where you want your music to feel materialized without it being on a streaming service.</strong><span> When you bounce your music out of the DAW, where are you going to listen to it? A song doesn‚Äôt feel realized on the Files app and Dropbox. It feels like a random file. </span><strong>On [untitled], a song comes to life, and you can let it sit there without pressure.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Dan:</strong><span> It's really sad that for many artists pre-[untitled], they had to listen to their precious creation, their precious emotional output, on a product that does not really value it. Right? </span><strong>You put the song that you wrote after you were sad one evening because your girlfriend broke up with you on Dropbox or the Files app, and it literally just feels like any other file. It's sitting right next to this PDF that your boss sent you.</strong><span> It's like sitting right next to where my emotions are is this random PDF about my professional life. There isn't this sense of treating unreleased music sacredly. It's kind of bizarre that it's easier and more delightful to listen to someone else's song on Spotify than to one‚Äôs own music on whatever service you're using.</span><strong> [untitled] is designed to treat your unreleased music preciously, and be the best place to listen to it.</strong></em></p><p><span>I‚Äôm sorry for the long quote, but it‚Äôs better you hear it from them directly. Those are not emotions I feel. I don‚Äôt make music. I grew up pre-Spotify, and when Spotify came out, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/33fbccbb-f33a-454a-81f3-11f21cec85d3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">it was magic</a><span>. But they feel it, you can tell when you talk to them, that they really want to build something great for musicians and their teams, like really want to do that, and that means building a business, because to scale you need revenue and resources, but in a way that you don‚Äôt normally feel talking to people making tools for enterprise, the business, for Dancho &amp; Jos√© is in service of the customers. </span></p><p>So Jos√© left his job and Dancho decided not to get one after college and the two ‚Äì I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm going to have to apologize for the second time in two paragraphs ‚Äì got the band back together.  </p><p>Thus came the tension that always comes for artists: you need money to create art.</p><h3><strong>Investing in Music</strong></h3><p><span>I‚Äôm being dramatic. Dancho &amp; Jos√© felt no conflict.

Ethan Daly, who works with Mo at Shine, thinks [untitled] potentially increases artists‚Äô consumptive behavior. ‚ÄúMost musicians' favorite artist is themself and they love listening to their own music pre-release (this changes drastically once a song is out),‚Äù he told me, from experience. ‚ÄúI've even found myself listening to songs I'm working on 10x, 20x, 30x+ a day, both out of enjoyment and to make passive improvements, which I add to my track notes.‚Äù </p><blockquote><p><em><span>There is an ownership and obsession bestowed upon a song when you make it that I </span><strong>aggressively compare to having a child</strong><span>.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>‚ÄúCan‚Äôt they just listen to their baby on Soundcloud or Spotify?‚Äù you might be asking. But these are WIP tracks, not ready for prime time. And continuous playback isn‚Äôt readily available in other storage products, which weren‚Äôt designed for music. Listening is clunky there, and you definitely can‚Äôt edit and take notes while you listen there, like you can in [untitled].</p><p>Playback was a hint that they were building something deeper, the glimmer of a full-stack music workflow product. </p><p>Listening went up every month, without much marketing, through Word of Mouth. ‚ÄúOh shit,‚Äù Adam recalled thinking, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing people using the product this way more than my original hypothesis.‚Äù </p><p>Then, the next question, maybe the question that so many investors have asked and answered that there‚Äôs still an opportunity to make a mobile app (!) for musicians (!) in 2024 (!): </p><p><strong>‚ÄúIf this is just a music thing, how big can it get?‚Äù </strong></p><h3><strong>The Music (Software) Business </strong></h3><p>Music software can be split into two categories:</p><ol><li><p>Consumption</p></li><li><p>Creation </p></li></ol><p><span>‚ÄúDistribution is a third, in my opinion,‚Äù Jos√© told me, ‚ÄúHowever, on platforms where creation and consumption are both available and tightly coupled‚Ä¶ </span><strong>distribution collapses</strong><span>.‚Äù </span></p><p><span>When I asked Dancho whether there actually was a Why Now for [untitled], he said there wasn‚Äôt a big technological one ‚Äì ‚Äúthis probably could have come out any time post-iPhone‚Äù ‚Äì but there actually </span><em>is </em><span>a business model one, about the interplay between consumption and creation. </span></p><p>And it goes a little something like this‚Ä¶  </p><p><span>Napster came out in 1999 and set off a dramatic decline in</span><em> </em><span>the music industry‚Äôs revenue as consumption shifted from CDs ‚Äì which cost ~$18 and bundled songs you wanted with a bunch of others you had to pay for to get the ones you wanted ‚Äì to downloads - which were free and a la carte.

In other words, there was little appetite among the most talented entrepreneurs to build tools for an industry with declining revenues and no end in sight.

It was fine ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt raising, they didn‚Äôt </span><em>need </em><span>the money ‚Äì they just didn‚Äôt think it was happening. </span></p><p>‚ÄúA few days after they passed ‚Äì 12 days after that,‚Äù Dancho recounted: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>We get an email from Anish saying, something like, ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôve been using your app for the past week, I‚Äôm obsessed, want to make something happen.‚Äù He fully apologized. </span><strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôve never done this where I passed and wanted to make something happen, but I‚Äôm in love with your app and want to make something happen.‚Äù</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Then he made something happen. </span><strong>a16z led an $18 million Series A.</strong></p><p>Which is a fun thing to be able to say about a portfolio company, but really, is the money Dancho, Jos√©, and their absurdly small 7-person team need to start building down the stack. </p><p>Because sitting at the ‚Äútop of the Musical Creator Stack‚Äù is just the right entry point to go further down, to ‚Äúvertically integrate the entire music stack for artists.‚Äù </p><p>Remember, though, when Adam said that it wasn‚Äôt clear if that was even technically possible? </p><p>‚ÄúYou need to ask them to see the latest design,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an extremely feature-rich product designed in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming at all. I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôve done it.‚Äù </p><p>Of course, Adam is an [untitled] investor. He‚Äôs supposed to say nice things for public consumption. But he also said it wasn‚Äôt always like this. </p><p>‚ÄúThere was a long period where it was extremely frustrating,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThey treated the product like a Faberge Egg that they didn‚Äôt want to break. They didn‚Äôt want to get it into the hands of users to tell them it sucked.‚Äù Adam, Mo, and Niko had to push Dancho &amp; Jos√© into the deep end: ‚ÄúYou need to ship faster and you need to get user feedback in tighter loops because development cycles aren‚Äôt happening quickly enough.‚Äù </p><p>There‚Äôs always that tension, in music, between art and capital. The artist wants it to be perfect. The capitalist wants it to make money. It‚Äôs clear talking to Dancho &amp; Jos√©, and hearing these stories, that they lean artist. Which is probably why the product is so damn good in an age when most apps kind of suck. </p><p>But once again, you need money to make the art, and you need crowds to tell you if it‚Äôs any good. </p><p>So they listened. This is the back half of 2023. And they put the product in musicians‚Äô hands, afraid that they were going to have their feelings hurt, and ‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt. Musicians loved it. They realized they built something that people actually wanted, lots of people. They combined the artists‚Äô sensitivity with the capitalists‚Äô speed, and tightened that craft, ship, iterate loop, and that‚Äôs why, in the spring of 2024, the product was growing fast enough and gaining enough popularity ‚Äì even among the big time artists backing the Cultural Leadership Fund ‚Äì that a16z took notice and wrote them a check. </p><p>Which is why they can build more of the OS, now, which Dancho showed me the other day. </p><h3><strong>The Operating System for Music</strong></h3><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ready to show this to a lot of people yet,‚Äù Dancho warned, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll show you what we have.‚Äù </p><p>Describing the app in words is, at best, like trying to get you to appreciate a song by reading you the lyrics in monotone. Maybe I‚Äôll start with some OS philosophy, which does work in words.</p><p>‚ÄúIf you think about an Operating System‚Äù ‚Äì this is how Dancho started the demo, and I think gives a hint as to why this team is so good at product ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt has a bunch of different apps that do the different things you need.‚Äù</p><blockquote><p><em>The beauty of an OS is that</em></p><p><em>If I don‚Äôt need something </em></p><p><em>It‚Äôs not in the way. </em></p><p><em>Philosophically,</em></p><p><em>That‚Äôs what we wanted to achieve</em></p><p><em>Adding more creative tools. </em></p><p><em>Offering a lot of tools</em></p><p><em>While keeping the app simple</em></p><p><em>So the tool doesn‚Äôt get in the way</em></p><p><em>When you don‚Äôt need it. </em></p><p><em>DAWs have a lot.</em></p><p><em>They‚Äôre overwhelming.</em></p><p><em>We want to be </em></p><p><em>Powerful</em></p><p><em>Yet simple</em></p><p><em>At the same time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Then he showed me. It‚Äôs like three little apps: Notes, Edit, Record. </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong><span> to write down lyrics, jot down ideas for collaborators and fans. </span></p><p><strong>Record:</strong><span> self-explanatory.

One telling anecdote: songs have gotten shorter in recent years (the chart on the left) for a very specific reason: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, </span><strong>this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties. </strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Even better, the same listener can listen to your two-minute song two times in four minutes, but can only listen to your four-minute song once in four minutes. So shorter songs get more plays, and therefore higher rankings on the charts and more revenue. This, Ball explains, is one of the reasons Lil Nas X‚Äôs 1:53 </span><em>Old Town Road</em><span> was the top track of 2019. </span></p><div><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png"></div><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736239187793c9e492e687db01"><p>Old Town Road</p><p>Lil Nas X</p><p>If [untitled] succeeds, what might the new model look like? </p><p>The way that Dancho &amp; Jos√© see it, making it easier to share and discover WIP tracks is a way for artists to test their music, and fans to find new music, en route to the traditional path to labels and DSPs. Sharing and getting feedback, in this scenario, means that artists are more likely to release polished final tracks that appeal to their fans, who will consume where they currently consume, on Spotify or TikTok. And that may be the case. </p><p>But I wonder if that vision of the future is less radical than the one that might come to pass. </p><p>Ethan at Shine told me that while social sharing for both professional musicians and novices might feel like a stepping stone to the DSPs, ‚Äúmany users prefer to end the journey here rather than watching their music get lost in the shuffle of streaming platforms and monthly listener counts dwindling to zero.‚Äù </p><p>There‚Äôs a version of the [untitled] discography ‚Äì not yet fully created, still to come ‚Äì in which the company shakes up the music industry more than even its founders are willing to dream. To pick up the faint sounds of that future, we‚Äôre going to have to flip to the B-Side. </p><h3><strong>B-Side: Strategic Analysis</strong></h3><p>If you view the music industry as something frozen in amber in the early 2000s, then you might expect that now, now that people are building tools for music creators again, the industry may speedrun the changes that have taken place to most other industries whose products could be digitized. </p><p><span>In</span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ac638932-80c2-4528-95e3-4a70daec8084?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"> </a><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ac638932-80c2-4528-95e3-4a70daec8084?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Vertical Integrators</a></em><span>, I talked about why there won‚Äôt be any more Aggregators:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The short version is that Aggregators had already won the biggest categories that were susceptible to Aggregators, and that the remaining categories were too small to support the necessary model: spend a lot upfront, and make it back on small margin dollars over a huge amount of transactions.</em></p><p><em>One addition to that hypothesis is that Aggregators worked for categories that were either digital ‚Äì and therefore where marginal costs for new supply was practically zero ‚Äì or where supply already existed, like cars or homes. Better allocating those existing resources was a coordination problem ‚Äì an information problem ‚Äì and therefore susceptible to Aggregators.</em></p></blockquote><p>The more I think about it, the more I think music might prove me wrong. </p><p><span>Music is a funny category from the perspective of Aggregators. In 2017‚Äôs </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9590f942-2fe9-4606-8a6c-7f02badf5a7a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Great Unbundling</a></em><span>, Ben Thompson wrote that the music industry had surprisingly ended up in pretty good shape, ultimately and ironically undisrupted by the internet: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>While piracy drove the music labels into the arms of Apple, which unbundled the album into the song, streaming has rewarded the integration of back catalogs and new music with bundle economics: more and more users are willing to pay $10/month for access to everything, significantly increasing the average revenue per customer. The result is an industry that looks remarkably similar to the pre-Internet era:</em></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/af221207-366d-47ba-b706-148811394317?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1552,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fb160e7-71a8-44e7-9a5d-0b414c6f8bc7_776x277.png"></a></figure></div><p><em>Notice how little power Spotify and Apple Music have; neither has a sufficient user base to attract suppliers (artists) based on pure economics, in part because they don‚Äôt have access to back catalogs. Unlike newspapers, music labels built an integration that transcends distribution.</em></p></blockquote><p>Back then, he didn‚Äôt think of Spotify as an Aggregator because it had to pay so much of its margin to the record labels. It had failed to commoditize the labels. </p><p><span>In 2022‚Äôs </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/2254f575-bb53-4840-91ec-966925f3a74c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Spotify, Netflix, and Aggregation</a></em><span>, Thompson changes his mind, arguing that while Spotify hadn‚Äôt made content acquisition </span><em>free</em><span>, it had commoditized content and shifted the power from owning supply to owning demand. In a world of abundant, zero-distribution-cost music, controlling the ‚Äúbest means to surface the content users want‚Äù is a valuable place to sit. Spotify started to put a price on that value, Thompson noted, in the form of ‚Äúpromotion,‚Äù or advertising. </span></p><p>Spotify, he realized, was more of an Aggregator than he thought. </p><p><span>What‚Äôs interesting about other Aggregators ‚Äì particularly Level 3 Aggregators with zero supply costs like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube ‚Äì didn‚Äôt just change the nature of supply, </span><strong>they changed what supply looked like and who could be a supplier</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Twitter, for example, didn‚Äôt just aggregate news stories from professional journalists, it turned anyone into a kind of micro-journalist. It made it really easy to get your written thoughts in front of a large audience and expanded the pool of people who could do so. </p><p>Ditto Google and Facebook, both of which aggregated traditional journalism as it moved online, but both of which enabled new types of content and new types of content creators. </p><p><span>With Google, any coder in a garage could spin up a website ‚Äì a new form of content ‚Äì and let the world find it. With Facebook, your crazy uncle‚Äôs deranged political takes ‚Äì an age-old but newly digitized form of content ‚Äì appeared in the same feed as stories from </span><em>The New York Times </em><span>and pictures from your friend‚Äôs party last night. </span></p><p>With Instagram, everyone became a photographer. With TikTok, anyone could make short-form videos. </p><p>Think about YouTube ‚Äì think about the vast diversity of content on the platform compared to the content that a major studio would release in theaters or on TV. </p><p><strong>Spotify, while changing music‚Äôs distribution and business model, and while incentivizing a move back towards shorter songs, didn‚Äôt fundamentally change the ‚Äúatomic unit‚Äù of supply, to steal Anish‚Äôs phrase. </strong></p><p><strong>[untitled], in the mega-bull case, has the opportunity to do just that.</strong><span> </span></p><p><strong>First, once it adds AI creation tools, [untitled] changes who can make music and what they can make. </strong></p><p>A talented guitarist doesn‚Äôt have to join a band and be a bit player in the lead singer‚Äôs show. She can play guitar and fill in an orchestra, even vocalists, behind her. I can write some lyrics, sing into [untitled], and back myself up with a digital band, tell it to sound a little more like Daft Punk, a little less like ABBA, or whatever. </p><p><span>Traditional musicians ‚Äì the ones releasing albums on all of the DSPs today ‚Äì expand what they can make and </span><em>how much they can make</em><span>. </span></p><p><strong>So second, just like there are many more tweets than there are articles in newspapers, there will be many more songs than there are on Spotify.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Many of them will make their way to Spotify and the other DSPs, but I‚Äôd imagine many of them won‚Äôt. They might be shared on other platforms  like TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter, in group chats with a small number of friends, or custom made for that special someone in a special moment. </p><p><strong>Third, exactly what that atomic unit is changes.</strong><span> </span></p><p>It might not be the song itself, or an album, or a playlist, but a journey ‚Äì all of the versions, cover arts, notes, that go into making a song. </p><p><span>This is all speculation ‚Äì Dancho &amp; Jos√© haven‚Äôt said this is where the product is heading ‚Äì but </span><strong>I think there‚Äôs a world in which listeners subscribe to artists and get the full stream of what they‚Äôre working on</strong><span>: the WIP tracks, the completed tracks, the notes. Maybe they can take tracks and split them, remix them, release their own. Maybe there‚Äôs some attribution that pays out the original artist when their track is split, remixed, released, and paid for. </span></p><p>‚ÄúWe believe creation is a higher form of consumption and expect more and more consumers to demand these types of experiences in the future,‚Äù Ethan at Shine told me. And that while consumption on streaming platforms might not increase with more creation ‚Äì we only have two ears, and they only have so many hours in a day ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur bet is that democratizing access to the creative process will increase the population of "music creators" (many of which never make it to DSPs) and [untitled] will be able to directly monetize the full spectrum of consumers interested in music - ranging from fans, to novice beatmakers, to superstars - through premium tools and access to musical artifacts.‚Äù</p><p><span>[untitled] is the first investment that Shine has made against its two-year-old thesis ‚Äì Mo and I had our call right after I wrote this last section, so if I‚Äôm crazy, Mo‚Äôs crazy too ‚Äì that </span><strong>consumer was going to make a comeback, in a different form. </strong></p><p>That it was going to be about reestablishing meaning as an important vector. ‚ÄúMusic,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis the most fundamentally unifying creative type.‚Äù That these platforms would start out single-player ‚Äì like [untitled] has ‚Äì earn stickiness by providing a lot of value, and then grow out in concentric circles, growing out from the artist at the core. </p><p>The atomic unit becomes the artist, or the process, or something ‚Äì the way that more people are paying for individual Substacks because they just want to read whatever that person writes. </p><p>What happens to the labels in this world? Does [untitled] replace them? </p><p>Maybe they survive, but become less relevant, the way newspaper publishers have survived, but become less relevant. They still own valuable back catalogs at the very least. But think about what a label does: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Financing:</strong><span> not as important when the cost to create and distribute trends towards $7.99 per month. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>A&amp;R:</strong><span> not as important when music becomes networked, when anyone with taste can be a scout. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Production: </strong><span>not as important when more of that happens in the app.</span><strong> </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Album creation: </strong><span>not as important if the album is no longer an atomic unit, and the fans can give their input on what the artist makes directly. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing &amp; Promotion</strong><span>: not as important, again, if it‚Äôs networked. I don‚Äôt pay someone to market and promote my newsletters or tweets. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution:</strong><span> not as important when you can distribute to DSPs at the push of a button.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Business management: not as important if software can handle payouts.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Tour support and merch:</strong><span> probably gets unbundled. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Industry connections:</strong><span> not as important when you‚Äôre going direct. </span></p></li></ol><p>I‚Äôm painting an extreme version of this future. A lot of these functions will still have value. People have been incorrectly predicting the end of labels for a long time. But I really do think a lot changes when the nature of who creates and what they create does. </p><p><span>Besides, Frank Ocean doesn‚Äôt work with a label. He released </span><em>Blonde</em><span> through his own just a few days after fulfilling and ending his contractual obligations with Def Jam/Universal in 2016, and that‚Äôs worked out just fine. </span></p><div><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png"></div><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c5649add07ed3720be9d5526"><p>Blonde</p><p>Frank Ocean</p><p>Album</p><p>Just how much of this new future [untitled] wants to or can build itself is an open question, but if they‚Äôre successful in changing how artists create, they‚Äôre questions that will need to be answered. </p><h3><strong>WIP</strong></h3><p>It‚Äôs probably appropriate that they don‚Äôt have the answers. [untitled] is a sacred place for works-in-progress, after all. </p><p><span>What I can say for sure though is that this feels </span><em>fun</em><span>. It feels like a throwback to a time ‚Äì like 10 or 15 years ago ‚Äì when you could just make an app and put it in peoples‚Äô hands and see what they did with it. </span></p><p>It‚Äôs a weird accident of history that there‚Äôs an opportunity to build a consumer app in a big category that matters, like music, and it seems as if by building that app, Dancho &amp; Jos√© have brought some of that 2010 vibe into 2024. </p><p><span>What I experienced at Elsewhere that night is exactly the kind of thing you </span><em>want </em><span>to experience around an app, the kind of thing you </span><em>did </em><span>experience before building apps became </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bc6b9f39-f3c0-43fa-a8a7-d6a6b9da8491?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">playbooked</a><span> and commoditized and boring.
