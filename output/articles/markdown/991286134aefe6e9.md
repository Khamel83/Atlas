He had previously suffered from a rare inherited retinal dystrophy for over a decade but experienced significant improvement within weeks of treatment. The procedure involves injecting a modified virus carrying a functional copy of the faulty gene into the retina </span><em>(which doesn‚Äôt sound super pleasant tbh)</em><span>, enabling cells to produce the missing enzyme needed for vision. Professor David Keegan, the lead surgeon, called this a major step in precision medicine, with a national registry now being developed to identify more patients.</span></p><p>I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next.</p><p><em>Smriti Mallapaty for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>A two-and-a-half-year-old girl shows no signs of a rare genetic disorder, after becoming the first person to be treated for the motor-neuron condition while in the womb. The child‚Äôs mother took the gene-targeting drug during late pregnancy, and the child continues to take it.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/539c4e06-b47a-46b0-9780-60c2fbf67a7e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3c05e8-818e-4103-a4f7-3207181f0322_767x527.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>More cool gene therapy stuff.</p><p>For the first time, a fetus was successfully treated for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a severe genetic disorder that typically leads to fatal motor neuron degeneration in infancy. The child's mother took Risdiplam, a gene-modifying drug, during the final six weeks of pregnancy, and the child has continued treatment post-birth. Now nearly three years old, the child shows no signs of the disease, which is unprecedented for cases this severe. Hell yeah!</p><p><span>This breakthrough suggests that early, in-utero intervention could significantly improve outcomes for SMA, which remains a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The idea originated from the parents </span><em>(talk about being good parents!)</em><span>, who had lost a previous child to the disease, and the FDA approved the treatment for this one case </span><em>(go‚Ä¶FDA?)</em><span>. This is a one-of-one case, but if replicated, this approach could shift how we treat diseases before birth.</span></p><p><em>From Arc Institute</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation‚Äîfrom noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants‚Äîwithout task-specific finetuning.

It predicts whether mutations are harmful or benign without specific training on human disease data, outperforming specialized models and accurately handling noncoding mutations‚Äîsuggesting it has internalized DNA‚Äôs fundamental principles. That‚Äôs right: Evo 2 has learned the core rules of DNA on its own, allowing it to predict genetic effects across all life forms without being specifically trained on human disease data.</p><p><strong>Evo 2 can create entire DNA sequences,</strong><span> like those for mitochondria and bacteria, in a way that looks natural. It can also control how genes are turned on or off by influencing DNA structure. As a test, researchers used it to encode Morse code into DNA, showing its potential for designing custom genetic systems.</span></p><p><span>One more time for those in the back: like God and/or evolution, </span><strong>Evo 2 can create entire DNA sequences.</strong></p><p>Better yet, Evo 2 is fully open-source, making genome design more accessible and increasing the pace of innovation in bioengineering. In the future, we won‚Äôt just study biology, we‚Äôll code it.</p><p><em>Juraj Gottweis, Google Fellow, and Vivek Natarajan, Research Lead</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We introduce AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system built with Gemini 2.0 as a virtual scientific collaborator to help scientists generate novel hypotheses and research proposals, and to accelerate the clock speed of scientific and biomedical discoveries.</em></p></blockquote><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9b77ac54-0aef-43ad-b3a1-b52baee857ea?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/X0RTjLKzdAA"></a><p>If it wasn‚Äôt yet abundantly clear already, the pace of scientific research and discovery is about to absolutely take off. To that end, this week Google introduced AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system designed to assist researchers by generating novel hypotheses, research plans, and experimental protocols.</p><p><span>This isn‚Äôt just a powerful LLM that churns through existing research and summarizes the literature. AI co-scientist mimics the scientific method, using specialized agents to iteratively refine ideas and improve output quality, allowing it to generate novel research ideas. It operates like a scientist: self-critique, ranking, feedback loops. And not just any scientist, a </span><em>successful</em><span> scientist.</span></p><p>So far, early testing has shown promising results in biomedical research, things like drug repurposing and disease targeting discovery. It has also demonstrated the ability to rediscover novel mechanisms in antimicrobial resistance, validating its potential as a scientific collaborator. Meaning, AI co-scientist came to a similar conclusion as human researchers, but without exposure to their unpublished work. It scientific method-ed its way to the same conclusion. </p><p>If AGI looks something like automated expert level and breakthrough research, then boy, AGI feels closer and closer.

A </span><strong>topological qubit</strong><span> is a special kind of qubit that stores information in the way certain particles move and interact, making it much more stable and resistant to errors than regular qubits. There‚Äôs that error reduction bit again. Any time you read about advancements in quantum computing, it generally is about some novel way of error reduction. </span></p><p><span>So what exactly did Microsoft do? The team developed a device that can measure the state of special particles called </span><em>Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs)</em><span>. MZMs are special quantum particles that act as their own antimatter and can store quantum information in a way that makes them resistant to errors. Using a superconducting nanowire and quantum capacitance measurements, they detected these states quickly and with high accuracy‚Äîmaking errors only 1% of the time. The measured states remained stable for over a millisecond, long enough to be useful for computation. </span></p><p>Anyway you cut it, this research is a pretty big advancement on the road towards useful quantum computing. That said, there is still some skepticism around whether the observed signals truly come from MZMs in a topological phase or from more conventional quantum states that mimic their behavior. Without that definitive proof that these are genuine MZMs, it‚Äôs still a breakthrough but the path towards scalable useful quantum is way less clear.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went on Dwarkesh to talk about his company‚Äôs quantum breakthrough, AI video game creation, and path to smarter and smarter machines. </p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c0603fd6-3a7f-469d-adb4-37935d469acc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/4GLSzuYXh6w"></a><p>The whole thing is worth a watch, but the part we agree with most is Satya‚Äôs assertion that you shouldn‚Äôt believe AGI is here when any lab tells you it is, but when GPD starts growing at 10% a year. Again - just a really great time to be a human. </p><p><strong>(6) Big Week for the Robots, Too</strong></p><p>Packy here. Not only are we adding a sixth story, but it‚Äôs a two-for-one.
