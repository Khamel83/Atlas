Equifax today announced a “cybersecurity incident”. In other words, they were hacked, and about 143 million US consumers are potentially affected.

Equifax says that the information accessed “primarily includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. In addition, credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers, were accessed.”

Ouch. Luckily Equifax has made it easy to find out if you were affected. Simply go to this website and fill out the text boxes:

Neither my wife nor I were affected (assuming this site is working properly!)
