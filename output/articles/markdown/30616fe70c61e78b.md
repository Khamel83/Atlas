Moody’s notes: </span></p><pre><code><code>“Robust 2024 issuance has helped speculative-grade issuers reduce their near-term refinancing and default risk. However, risky credits with high leverage and low interest coverage ratios, will continue to struggle. Distressed companies that restructured through distressed exchanges in recent years without cutting debt to sustainable levels can default again.”</code></code></pre><p>Music to RX professionals’ ears! </p><p>But it gets better. Moody’s was talking about the rosiest of scenarios. Moody’s wants to manage expectations given macroeconomic and geopolitical risks out there: </p><pre><code><code>“While our baseline scenario does not expect a sharp increase in corporate default rates over the next 12 months, certain economic and financial developments outside our baseline expectations could lead to a higher default rate. Therefore, we have also developed moderately pessimistic and severely pessimistic scenarios, which may unfold if one or more of the following were to crystallize: greater macroeconomic disruption because of geopolitical risks; growing protectionism including larger tariffs that lead to greater disruption in trade and supply chains, causing inflation re-acceleration and a sharper global economic slowdown; and stress in any part of the financial sector (e.g., commercial real estate) that spills over into the economy more broadly. 

Under our moderately pessimistic scenario, the US high-yield spread would widen to as much as 926 bps in the coming four quarters and the unemployment rate would rise to 8.3%. Under this scenario, the global speculative-grade default rate would increase to 5.9% by the end of October 2025. Our severely pessimistic scenario assumes even weaker macroeconomic conditions, with a surge in the US high-yield spread to as much as 1,232 bps and a jump in the unemployment rate to 8.9%. Under this scenario, the global speculative grade default rate would rise to 9.6% in a year, reaching the peak level after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.”</code></code></pre><p>Whoa.

Citing “</span><em>lingering softeness in discretionary categories,</em><span>” the bigbox retailer missed revenue estimates by 1% and came in $0.45 EPS below consensus. Same store sales rose merely 0.3% YOY. Comp sales fell 1.9% YOY. One positive: digital sales, which increased 10.8% YOY. After raising guidance last quarter, TGT lowered guidance back down — and the market punished them accordingly. Management here seems to … how should we put this … suck. They knew consumers were becoming more discerning with their spend and didn’t respond appropriately. For instance, costs remain elevated, unable to offset margin compression. The stock is down ~55% from its ATH. 😬</span></p><p>On the flip side, Walmart absolutely crushed. For its Q3’25, it surprised to the upside with revenues of $169.6b (beast!) up 5.5% YOY. E-commerce grew by 22% in the U.S., blowing away analyst expectations of roughly 2.2%. Yes, you read that correctly: twenty-two versus two-point-two. E-commerce sales were up 43% internationally.
