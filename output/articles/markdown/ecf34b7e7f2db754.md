So many choices when saving your images! The Image File Types Decoded infographic from tekRESCUE does a great job of clarifying the options in this handy infographic!

Information technology can get complicated very quickly, and digital image files are no exception to this rule. You’ve likely come across a few of the different types of image files such as JPEGs, GIFs, PNGs, and others. You’ve also likely wondered what the difference is between all of these different abbreviations. That’s why we’ve put together an infographic comparing some of the most common types of files you’re likely to encounter on and create for the web.

In the graphic, we take a play-by-play look at the different properties of digital images and how the properties relate to each file type. We hope you’ll find the information useful whether you’re an image newbie or a seasoned graphic designer. Skip below the infographic if you prefer to digest the information in text form.

Some of the topics, like Image Compression, are over-simplified for purposes of this infographic. JPG is the king of file compression, but the infographic implies that other file types don’t support compression. That’s not exactly true. They have compression, but it isn’t anywhere as effective as JPG.
