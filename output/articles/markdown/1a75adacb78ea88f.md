# Chase Sapphire Reserve and Ritz Cardholders Now Have Access to Digital Priority Pass The Points Guy

**Description:** One popular benefit offered on many premium credit cards is a membership to the Priority Pass lounge network. But until recently, only certain cards would let you use a virtual card to access the lounges. Notably absent: the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card. Even worse, these two cards have the most generous Priority Pass guesting policies, allowing unlimited guests to enter with the member at no cost.

Because of this restriction, if you have either of these two cards, up until now you needed to take your physical Priority Pass membership card with you when traveling. This confusion could lead to mistakes, like when TPG reader Janice used the wrong Priority Pass card and ended up with a $189 charge for using a lounge that she could’ve entered for free using the correct card.

But starting this week, cardholders of both the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card are eligible to set-up a digital Priority Pass card. When I spoke with Chase customer service about this development, the rep noted that this feature was just added Wednesday. Affected cardholders will be receiving letters soon about the change.

However, that doesn’t have to delay your use of this new tool. Let’s walk through how to set-up your Priority Pass account for digital use.

First, you’re going to need your physical Priority Pass card and know your Priority Pass membership expiration date to complete the digital setup. If you don’t have access to both of these, you can call Chase via the number on the back of your card. The customer service representative can connect you with a Priority Pass agent who will read off your account number and expiration date.

Once you have this info, here are the next steps:

Navigate to http://ift.tt/2B1swJu

Enter your card number, expiration date and solve the Captcha.

Set-up a Priority Pass account by providing your email address and setting up login information. If you already have a Priority Pass account, it looks like you’re going to have to set-up a new account for this card; I haven’t found a way to add a membership to an existing account.

Download the Priority Pass app (Google Play and Apple Store)

Open the app and log in with your new account. Note that you can have multiple accounts linked on the app.

Select the menu bar and select “My Digital Card” to confirm that the digital card is available.

Keep in mind that not all lounges accept the digital card. So, it can’t hurt to bring the physical card along with you when you travel. However, now you’ll at least have a shot of entering lounges if you forget.

<div><p>Lounge access is now more accessible than ever, thanks to myriad credit cards offering this perk as a benefit. <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-lounge-access-credit-cards/">Lounge access</a> typically makes for a more luxe, less stressful travel experience.</p><p>This is the case with many <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best/">top rewards credit cards</a> that offer access to <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/how-to-enroll-in-priority-pass-with-eligible-credit-cards/">Priority Pass</a> airport lounges. Although you may already have a Priority Pass card in your wallet or on your phone, it's sometimes unclear what that means and what's included in your membership.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Priority Pass membership isn't automatic; if you have a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/airport-lounge-access/">credit card that offers membership</a>, you still need to enroll to activate your membership benefits.</p><p>Let's look at the different levels of Priority Pass membership, which cards offer it and how to get the most out of your access.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/10/Orlando-MCOHero-Shot-scaled.jpg?width=1080"></div><figcaption>PLAZA PREMIUM</figcaption></figure><h2>What is Priority Pass?</h2><p>Priority Pass is a network of airport lounges, private suites and <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/priority-pass-adds-new-restaurant-us/">even airport restaurants.</a> The company currently boasts 1,700 eligible locations in over 600 cities in 145 countries.</p><p>Although those numbers are impressive, many Priority Pass lounges are outside the U.S. As a result, there's no guarantee you'll have access to a lounge on every trip.</p><p>Priority Pass lounges are at more than 40 U.S. airports, and some have multiple lounges, including:</p><ul><li>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)</li><li>Boston Logan International Airport (BOS)</li><li>Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF)</li><li>Charleston International Airport (CHS)</li><li>Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT)</li><li>Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG)</li><li>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)</li><li>Harry Reid International Airport (LAS)</li><li>Miami International Airport (MIA)</li><li>Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP)</li><li>John F.

There's even a lounge with a pool in the Dominican Republic's Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ).</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/01/punta-cana-lounge-with-pool-scott-mayerowitz.png?width=1080"></div><figcaption>The lounge in Punta Cana even has a pool. SCOTT MAYEROWITZ/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure><p>The facilities in the Priority Pass network vary by owner and location. Some lounges, like The Club ATL in Atlanta, are independent facilities, while others are affiliated with airlines. The Turkish Airlines Lounge in Washington D.C. and the Air France Lounge in Boston are two examples of this.</p><p>If you are traveling with guests and children, you'll also want to check the rules of your desired lounge location and your Priority Pass membership to determine if there will be an additional charge or a guest limit.</p><h2>Priority Pass Airport Lounge Amenities</h2><p>At most Priority Pass lounges, you'll find a bar, snacks and a dedicated Wi-Fi network. These lounges also give you a place to relax away from the chaos of the airport terminal, which can be a benefit in and of itself at major hubs.</p><p>That said, amenities vary by lounge, and it's worth researching before you visit a Priority Pass lounge, as their quality can vary quite dramatically.</p><p>Some, like the Vienna Lounge at Vienna International Airport (VIE), are in a class of their own (think priceless artworks and high-end food); others, such as the Bellini VIP Lounge at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport (CTA) in Sicily, are basically the opposite.</p><p>The Priority Pass app and website will show you each lounge's amenities and facilities.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-at-1.22.16%E2%80%AFPM.png?width=1080"></div><figcaption>PRIORITYPASS.COM</figcaption></figure><h3>Priority Pass restaurants and Minute Suites</h3><p>Priority Pass also partners with airport restaurants, lounges with hourly beds (<a href="https://thepointsguy.com/airline/minute-suites-airport-lounge/">Minute Suites</a>) and more. This lets members enjoy perks at airports without traditional lounges or eat at a restaurant in the terminal.</p><p>Note: American Express removed the restaurant benefit from its Priority Pass memberships some time ago, and <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/venture-x-priority-pass-changes/">Capital One removed this benefit</a> at the start of 2023 for personal Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card cardholders. Chase <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/chase-sapphire-reserve-lose-priority-pass-restaurant-access/">also removed this benefit</a> in July 2024.</p><p>Similarly, the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/reviews/it-pays-to-go-mobile-u-s-bank-altitude-reserve-visa-infinite-card-review/">U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite® Card</a>* offers eight Priority Pass visits per year, but according to a spokesperson for U.S. Bank, these cannot be used for Priority Pass restaurants.</p><p>The credit cards offering Priority Pass memberships that still include non-lounge visits, such as at spas and restaurants, include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-business/">Capital One Venture X Business</a> (<a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/venture-x-business-loses-priority-pass-restaurant-access/">only for eligible cardholders who applied before May 2024</a>, not for new applicants)</li><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/reviews/citi-prestige-credit-card-review/">Citi Prestige® Card</a>* (no longer open to new applicants)</li></ul><p><em>*The information for these cards has been collected independently by The Points Guy.

Some examples include:</p><ul><li>Miami International Airport (MIA): <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-lounges-miami-airport/#corona-beach-house-near-d-23-d-24">Corona Beach House</a></li><li>George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH): <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/lounges/usa/houston-tx-george-bush-intercontinental/iah8d-landrys-seafood">Landry's Seafood</a></li><li>San Francisco International Airport (SFO): <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/en/Lounges/North-America/USA/San-Francisco-CA/San-Francisco-CA-Intl/SFO12D-San-Francisco-Giants-Clubhouse">San Francisco Giants Clubhouse</a></li></ul><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/01/landrys-seafood-iah-summer-hull-tacos.png?width=1080"></div><figcaption>Breakfast tacos from Landry's Seafood at IAH. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure><p>The amount of the Priority Pass restaurant credit varies by location, but it averages $28 per person. Some restaurants also cap the number of guests.</p><p>At bars and restaurants, gratuity is not included, so be sure to tip on the bill amount before the credit is applied.</p><p>Priority Pass also has some less conventional airport options. For example, the PGA MSP Lounge at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) offers free access to a putting green, along with golf lessons and a golf simulator for a fee.</p><p>This lounge also offers a $15 credit that can be applied toward food, drinks or a golf experience. However, this location has the same limitations as the other non-lounge visits mentioned above.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2021/12/20211209_DFW-Lounges_SHull-71.jpg?width=1080"></div><figcaption>SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Priority Pass provides access to Minute Suites in Atlanta, Charlotte, Salt Lake City, Dallas-Fort Worth and Philadelphia. The first hour is included with your Priority Pass membership, and you can rent additional hours at a discounted rate of $34 per hour.</p><h2>Priority Pass membership levels</h2><p>There's a lot of confusion surrounding the terms "Priority Pass" and "Priority Pass Select," so we want to clear the air.</p><p>Priority Pass is the name of the company that offers memberships to lounges in its network. You can purchase Priority Pass memberships <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/en/join/step2?sourcecode=WPUN&amp;currency=USD&amp;country=USA">directly on the site</a>, with annual fees starting at $99. Here's a breakdown of the membership options:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard membership:</strong> $99 per year; includes visits for $35 each for the member and any guests.</li><li><strong>Standard Plus membership:</strong> $329 per year; includes 10 free visits, with subsequent visits for $35 each (the same price as all guest visits).</li><li><strong>Prestige membership: </strong>$469 per year. All visits are included for the member, though guests are charged $35 per visit.</li></ul><p>If you're considering one of the above Priority Pass membership packages, Standard is best for occasional travelers. Standard Plus is best suited to frequent travelers who visit airport lounges several times per year. The Prestige membership is for frequent flyers who make good use of unlimited lounge visits due to how often they travel.</p><p>Many <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/travel/">U.S. credit cards offer Priority Pass access</a> benefits called Priority Pass Select. Some are for just one person, while others include guests, depending on the card.</p><p>In either case, Priority Pass and Priority Pass Select members can pay for additional guests beyond what is included with their membership.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/08/20230816_Plaza-Premium-Lounge-London-Heathrow-Terminal-4_BSmithson_3.jpg?width=1080"></div><figcaption>BEN SMITHSON/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure><h2>What credit cards come with Priority Pass access?</h2><p>These are multiple credit cards through which you can get a Priority Pass Select membership.</p><p>These include premium travel cards like the <span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/oc/221211836?name=Chase%20Sapphire%20Reserve%20PID&amp;pid=221211836?tid=post">Chase Sapphire Reserve®</a></span> (see <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/tc/221212097?pid=221212097&amp;name=Chase%20Sapphire%20Reserve%C2%AE&amp;data-testid=ratesFees">rates and fees</a>) and <span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/oc/22504813?name=The%20Platinum%20Card%C2%AE%20from%20American%20Express&amp;pid=22504813?tid=post">The Platinum Card® from American Express</a></span> (enrollment required), hotel credit cards like the <span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/oc/6396?name=Marriott%20Bonvoy%20Brilliant%C2%AE%20American%20Express%C2%AE%20Card&amp;pid=6396?tid=post">Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card</a></span> (enrollment required) and the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-rewards-credit-card/">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a>, which even includes two guests.</p><p>Other cards that offer Priority Pass benefits include:</p><p><em>*The information for these cards has been collected independently by The Points Guy.

Find the link under "Benefits" when you log in to your account.</p><p>Because it can take a week or two to receive your membership card in the mail, it's best to enroll as soon as you receive your credit card if you're interested in this benefit.</p><p>In the meantime, you can download the Priority Pass app, which includes a digital membership card that you can use to access most, but not all, facilities.</p><p>Before your visit, make sure to know if guests are permitted as part of your benefit and how many; the lounge's reception team may not always know your specific guest privileges.</p><p>Since you're never asked to present your credit card at the lounge, you might not know you're charged for a guest until you see your statement.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2021/01/Turkish-Airlines-Lounge-Miami-MIA-Zach-Griff-27.jpeg?width=1080"></div><figcaption>ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY</figcaption></figure><h2>Lounge access isn't guaranteed</h2><p>Your best-laid lounge plans may not work out. Nowadays, many travelers have lounge access, and the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/airport-lounge-overcrowding-solutions/">lounges sometimes reach capacity</a>.</p><p>Some lounges are available to Priority Pass members only during select hours. Check the <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/en">Priority Pass website</a> before your next trip for available locations and their hours. Don't be shocked if some lounges are temporarily at capacity during peak times and deny access to Priority Pass members.</p><h2>FAQs about Priority Pass membership and lounge access</h2><p>Priority Pass is a huge lounge network with various membership tiers — so naturally, you might have some questions. Here are the answers to some commonly asked Priority Pass questions.</p><h3>Is Priority Pass worth it?</h3><p>That depends on how often you travel and how you obtain your Priority Pass membership.</p><p>If your membership is included with a credit card you already have, it's worth enrolling in the Priority Pass benefit and keeping the card with you. This way, you'll have access if you come across a Priority Pass lounge during your travels. Just be sure you know which amenities are included — remember, Amex, Chase and most Capital One cards no longer include access to Priority Pass restaurants and other non-lounge locations.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you cannot get a membership with a credit card, you should only purchase one if you plan to use it. You might consider buying a membership if your home airport or somewhere you travel frequently has a Priority Pass lounge. Likewise, it's only worth purchasing a membership if you travel enough to benefit from it. It's not likely worth it if you only travel once or twice per year.</p><h3>Priority Pass Select vs. Priority Pass — what's the difference?</h3><p>Priority Pass Select is a Priority Pass membership tier included with select premium credit cards. Depending on the bank that issues your membership, you can access Priority Pass lounges and possibly other Priority Pass amenities like restaurants.</p><h3>Can Priority Pass guests enter for free?</h3><p>This depends on your membership tier or the bank that issues your Priority Pass Select membership. Some cards, like the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, allow two guests per visit. Meanwhile, the membership included with certain American Express cards only includes one guest per visit. Check with your bank to see how many guests you can bring with you.</p><h3>What are the perks and amenities available with Priority Pass?</h3><p>In terms of lounges, the amenities you'll receive depend on the lounge you visit. Some may only offer basic snacks and a small bar. Others might provide a full meal and even spa amenities. Check the Priority Pass app or website to see what amenities are provided at the lounge you plan on visiting.</p><p>Further, some Priority Pass memberships include access to restaurants and other non-lounge experiences. However, as this article mentions, the number of credit cards offering access to these benefits has decreased sharply over the years.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>Several <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-credit-cards-priority-pass-lounge-access/">cards offer Priority Pass Select membership</a> as a benefit. This program can improve your travel experience with goodies like free food and drinks, as well as a comfortable place to relax or get some work done.</p><p>Check specific details of your membership, because the guest policies vary from card to card.</p><p><b>Related reading:</b></p><ul><li><a href="https://2025trends.thepointsguy.com/">TPG's 2025 travel trends report</a></li><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/essential-travel-tips/">Key travel tips you need to know — whether you're a first-time or frequent traveler</a></li><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/flight-cancellation-strategies/">6 real-life strategies you can use when your flight is canceled or delayed</a></li><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-cards-for-travel-purchases/">8 of the best credit cards for general travel purchases</a></li><li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/tpg-team-favorite-travel-items/">13 must-have items the TPG team can't travel without</a></li></ul></div>
