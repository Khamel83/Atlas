Jesus Heals the Sick
Mark 5:2-41 (NIV)

Jesus wished to bless the people and lead them to faith in God. Because he was the Son of God and God's power came upon him, he was able to bless the people with miracles of healing. He caused many who were blind to see, restored hearing to the deaf, made the lame to walk, and healed many of their sicknesses. He even brought some back to life.
