The magic is coming back. </span></p><p>At the same time, it‚Äôs been terribly sad to see the destruction in LA over the last couple of days. Lives are being sideswiped and uprooted, and being optimistic about the future is a lot easier when I am writing this from the comfort of my New York apartment with knowledge that my family and belongings are safe. </p><p>But LA will bounce back.

C-peptide levels also increase with a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), consistent with insulin secretion in response to a meal.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sana Biotechnology‚Äôs first-in-human study demonstrated that their hypoimmune (HIP) technology enables pancreatic islet cell transplantation in type 1 diabetes patients without the need for immunosuppression. This is a big deal because transplanted cells do not normally survive the body‚Äôs immune response, without immunosuppression.</p><p>In Type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys cells that produce insulin (called beta cells). Currently, if you transplant new insulin-producing cells from a donor, patients need to take powerful drugs to suppress their immune system to prevent rejection. That‚Äôs clearly not ideal.</p><p>Sana has developed a way to modify donor insulin-producing cells (called HIP technology) so they can "hide" from the immune system.</p><p>The transplanted cells produced insulin, as evidenced by C-peptide levels, and avoided immune rejection, meaning the transplanted cells successfully functioned like natural insulin-producing beta cells. Further more, the cells properly transplanted without the need for potentially harmful immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>This kind of cell transplant could completely change how we treat type 1 diabetes by offering a long-term solution without daily insulin shots or risky immune-suppressing drugs. Additionally, it shows that we might be able to transplant cells or organs without the body attacking them, which could transform how we treat all kinds of diseases.</p><p><span>Robert Nelsen, through whose </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/93acd32e-dac2-42c7-ba2b-f6df64c1a8e7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">tweet</a><span> we heard about the result, summed up the potential poignantly: ‚ÄúIn my 40 years of biotech, I was waiting to see this result. </span><strong>Never before have transplanted cells survived normal immune response without immunosuppression.</strong><span> Excited for patients, many whom I know see hope today for a possible cure for many diseases.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>On Halloween 2023, Elliot called cell-based therapies </span><span>With results like this, it‚Äôs easy to see how that may be the case. </span></p><p><em><span>From Eric W.

When they exposed non-neural cells (including kidney cells) to repeated chemical signals, the cells showed "memory-like" responses eerily similar to how neurons behave during learning - responding better to spaced-out stimuli than cramming, just like we do when studying. </p><p>Lead researcher Nikolay Kukushkin suggests we might one day be able to "train" cells to perform beneficial behaviors, like teaching muscle cells to produce healthy hormones or programming cancer cells to stop dividing. </p><p>"To the cells of our body, anything that we do regularly ‚Äî eating, exercising, taking medicine ‚Äî is a pattern of chemicals in time," explains Kukushkin. </p><p>The discovery suggests memory isn't just a brain thing, but rather a fundamental feature of cellular biology that evolution figured out long before nervous systems existed. </p><p>While there are some differences, this work parallels the mind-bending work Dr. Michael Levin is doing on bioelectricity at Tufts, with both challenging the traditional neurocentric view of information processing. Both show that non-neural cells can process and store information. Both suggest "intelligence-like" behaviors exist at the cellular level. Both point to potential therapeutic applications by manipulating cellular behavior. Both challenge the idea that information processing is unique to the brain. </p><p>If Levin is showing how groups of cells can make decisions and maintain patterns, this work is showing how individual cells can "learn" from repeated experiences - different scales of the same fascinating phenomenon of non-neural intelligence.</p><p><span>For more on Levin‚Äôs work, check out this </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/68123955-f404-4f5e-95a8-6052f30beb90?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">excellent recent interview</a><span>. </span></p><p><em>From Prime Intellect</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We are releasing a 7B parameter metagenomic foundation model designed for pandemic monitoring, trained on over 1.5T base pairs of DNA and RNA sequenced from wastewater.</em></p></blockquote><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/3bc97d83-b823-4119-9e97-cd10fb803699?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ZAGbEKLLAew"></a><p>You think AI is going to kill us?</p><p>Au contraire, mon fr√®re!</p><p>It could save us from the next pandemic or large scale bioattack.</p><p><span>A research team from USC, Prime Intellect, and Nucleic Acid Observatory released </span><strong>METAGENE-1</strong><span>, a groundbreaking 7-billion-parameter AI model trained on 1.5 trillion DNA and RNA base pairs from human wastewater to improve pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection.

What‚Äôs changed is that we‚Äôre actually getting moving on this thing. </span></p><p>The Thacker Pass project, located within the caldera, is aiming to produce 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually starting in 2026.

He‚Äôll bring some bold leadership and entertainment chops with him, and certainly a relatively heavy dose of anti-woke perspectives.</p><p>Zuck followed up this appointment with with a seemingly related update on Meta‚Äôs content moderation policies. In short, Meta has decided to disband its fact-checking program, opting instead of an style Community Notes model, and are further lifting the restrictions on free speech. We think this is a good thing!</p><p>The Meta content moderation situation was a story of death by a thousand cuts. No one individual content moderation decision was particularly offensive in my view ‚Äî and certainly each decision could be viewed as reasonable ‚Äî but these decisions mounted over time to the point that Meta was restricting free speech (which as a private company, is well within their rights). I think many of us are kind of guilty of this over the last decade ‚Äî make seemingly inclusive, safe, and politically correct decisions, that in a vacuum seem reasonable, but in aggregate warp our view of right and wrong, true and false, reality and fantasy. Many of us personally came to this realization over the last couple of years, and now Meta is as well.</p><p>Ultimately, this is a pro free speech move and that‚Äôs net-net a good thing. Free speech isn‚Äôt always pleasant, it doesn‚Äôt always make for the most squeaky clean social media network, and it will certainly cause some controversy. But ultimately free speech is the driver of societal progress: it‚Äôs how we challenge bad ideas, share truths, and foster understanding.</p><p>Pretty brave move by Zuck and the boys!</p><p>Packy again.
