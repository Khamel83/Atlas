This past Tuesday, paint company Behr announced its first-ever Color of the Year. It’s a shade that the company has christened “In The Moment T18-15,” a mellow blue-green tinctured with gray.

The company believes this particular color encourages mindfulness, that it's a tonic to the overstimulation of the digital age. It's a color meant to nudge us away from our devices and closer to nature.

“In The Moment speaks to our society’s desire to disconnect and be present,” Erika Woelfel, Behr’s vice president of color and creative services, said in a statement. It’s certainly a nice shade. The color's quite chameleonic, too, adapting to its surroundings so that it accents darker rooms, vivid and luminous when surrounded by light.

If In The Moment isn’t quite your speed, Behr has also rolled out a “Color Trends palette” that’s a spectrum of 20 shades they believe we'll be seeing more of over the next year.

Interpret this campaign as a bid, on Behr’s part, as a way to join the same bandwagon as Pantone, who annually dubs a certain color the Color of the Year. To my mind, In The Moment certainly beats any shade Pantone has picked in recent memory, though it doesn’t have a patch on Marrs Green, that blazing hue chosen as the world’s favorite color just a few weeks back.

But I understand why people may find Marrs Green too disorienting a color to bring into their homes. In The Moment is something like the more muted spiritual sister to Marrs Green. I'll take it.
