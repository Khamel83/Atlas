It was awesome. A group of my favorite progress thinkers and doers from the internet came to Lighthaven in Berkeley to discuss the question: </span><strong>how do we make more progress?</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>There was a range of talks and topics, but the topic that came up the most was some version of a debate over the 2020 paper by Nicholas Bloom, Chad Jones, John Van Reenen, and Michael Webb, </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e9f9d802-ba21-4cd5-9e7f-4ce39329653a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find</a></em><span>?</span></p><p>If ideas are getting harder to find and if the ‚Äúlow hanging fruit has been picked‚Äù ‚Äì and the authors argue that they are and it has ‚Äì then it‚Äôs unsurprising that we are stagnating. </p><p>Economic growth, they write, is a function of ideas, which is a function of research productivity and number of researchers. </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/541f3b1d-e987-4a2f-8234-1e4da6370768?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1496,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41615df-1f5a-4d29-a85d-1cc723782167_748x173.png"></a><figcaption><em>Bloom et al.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>To determine whether new ideas had indeed become harder to find, they looked at three specific case studies ‚Äì Moore‚Äôs Law, seed yields, and medical innovations ‚Äì and at the growth of the economy as a whole. </p><p>They found that in all the cases they examined, it‚Äôs taken more researchers just to find the same number of ideas over time, which means that ideas are getting harder to find, which implies that we either need to throw an exponentially increasing number of researchers at problems just to maintain our current growth rate (maybe possible with AI!) or settle in for a long stagnation. </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d10c9e92-e5f1-4cd4-b00c-397e4649fc6e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d22fbf-4c70-457f-9f29-ea8c93434174_908x588.png"></a><figcaption><em>Bloom et al. </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I am not an economist, so maybe this is just how these things work, but the whole argument strikes me as incredibly circular: </p><ul><li><p>The paper defines ideas as things that lead to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth.</p></li><li><p>TFP is the portion of economic output growth that cannot be explained by increases in the quantity of inputs (like labor and capital). </p></li><li><p>The paper then measures research productivity as TFP growth divided by research input.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it concludes that because this ratio is declining, ideas are getting harder to find.</p></li></ul><p><strong>By defining ideas in terms of TFP growth, the paper essentially assumes its conclusion.</strong><span> </span></p><p>The paper does provide valuable data on the relationship between research inputs and certain economic outputs over time, and it finds this pattern across various domains, which suggests there's something meaningful happening. And the authors have forgotten more about economics than I‚Äôll ever learn, so maybe I‚Äôm missing something. </p><p><strong>The problem is, the paper might actually lead to the </strong><em><strong>wrong</strong></em><strong> conclusion: that we need to throw more researchers at the problem, that we just need to produce more ideas. </strong></p><p><strong>For one thing, it might suggest that now that AI is here, we‚Äôre good.</strong><span> While the number of </span><em>human</em><span> researchers won‚Äôt be able to scale exponentially to offset declining research productivity, maybe the number of AI researchers can. If you assume that ideas are the bottleneck, then maybe you just hold out for a sufficiently intelligent model. </span></p><p>The question of whether AI would just solve progress came up multiple times at the conference. </p><p><span>The most common response was: no, </span><strong>ideas are not the bottleneck</strong><span>. </span></p><p><strong>On the opposite end of the spectrum, it might suggest that we are really and truly screwed.</strong><span> Total Factor Productivity really has fallen off since the 1970s, and if ideas just keep getting harder to find, and ideas are what drive TFP, then we might just be in for greater and greater stagnation.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/7c124321-1982-447f-9de9-a13770504bfc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0220e35-7413-49fe-ae86-894a24ca7bdb_908x511.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eli Dourado </em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Both of these are dangerous but passive. Wait and see. </p><p><strong>A third option, implied but not recommended by the paper, would be to throw more at research: more people, more education, more money. </strong><span>If ideas are getting harder to find ‚Äì if it takes more ‚Äúeffective researchers‚Äù to generate the same number of ideas ‚Äì then we need to produce more researchers to at least match the rate of decline in research productivity. </span></p><p><span>That strikes me as equivalent to observing that a football team‚Äôs yards per carry is declining and deciding that they need to run the ball more to make up for it. To torture this analogy a bit, it‚Äôs maybe even more equivalent to signing </span><em>more</em><span> running backs, whoever‚Äôs available off waivers, and then running the ball more with </span><em>them</em><span>, instead of fixing your offensive line. Worse, there are only 53 roster spots, so every new running back you sign means cutting someone who could be doing the blocking and tackling!</span></p><p><span>We will always need new ideas.

It‚Äôs simply arguing that the assumption of constant research productivity doesn‚Äôt hold up, and it makes its point. </p><p>But the simplistic takeaways ‚Äì that ideas are getting harder to come by so either we‚Äôre doomed, can expect AI to save us, or need to throw more researchers at the problem ‚Äì are dangerous and, I think, wrong. </p><p>There are plenty of good ideas waiting to be turned into progress.

If the slowdown in TFP growth can be explained by ideas getting harder to find, why did growth hit a brick wall in 1973 as opposed to slowly decaying as soon as ideas became harder to find? </p><p><span>Well, one question to ask might be ‚ÄúWhich factors contributed to TFP growth in the last good decades, the 1950s and 1960s, and when were the </span><strong>ideas</strong><span> for those factors discovered?‚Äù </span></p><p>I asked that question, to both Claude and Perplexity, and both cited: Petrochemicals/Plastics, Electronics / Semiconductors, Aviation, Antibiotics / Medical Advances, Mass Production Techniques, all of which were conceived of in the 1920s through 1940s or earlier! </p><p><span>By the time those ideas‚Äô productivity was realized, they were relatively old ideas. As </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9384a90a-d186-4dd7-8277-0547c2625f58?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Perplexity concluded</a><span>, ‚ÄúIn conclusion, while the 1950s and 1960s saw remarkable TFP growth, this ‚Äògolden age‚Äô was largely built on technological innovations and research from earlier decades, particularly the 1930s and 1940s.‚Äù There was a two decade lag. </span></p><p>So given the TFP fall-off in 1973, it‚Äôs not surprising that so many ideas from the 1950s and 1960s are still available to entrepreneurs today. It‚Äôs as if they were frozen in amber. </p><p><strong>The question isn‚Äôt whether good ideas have gotten harder to find, but why it got so hard to use the good ideas we already generate. </strong></p><p><span>In one of the best talks of the conference, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b71a4d4c-352b-4026-951e-4faeffed7d8b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Eli Dourado</a><span> argued that </span><strong>ideas aren‚Äôt getting harder to find; they‚Äôre getting harder to </strong><em><strong>use</strong></em><span>, thanks to the three rules put on innovation:</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e6128c48-7f64-45a2-9db9-27d999e906a9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0614e-9278-4001-af65-19225b0e8fd9_908x392.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eli Dourado</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>This is the precautionary principle ad absurdum.

That‚Äôs how progress happened. Edison‚Äôs electrical wires electrocuted people. The Wright Brothers faceplanted into the Kitty Hawk sand during test flights. The boilers on Vanderbilt‚Äôs steamships occasionally exploded. Then they iterated, improved, even undertook new research to create new and improved ideas to address the obstacles that can only be exposed by interaction with the real world. </p><p><span>Then, Americans‚Äô attitude towards risk shifted.

In Big Tech‚Äôs case, that means 24/7, reliable, clean power. In the DoD‚Äôs case, that means reliable power that is easy to transport. </span></p><p><strong>This premium demand is often critical to the development and diffusion of technologies.</strong><span> Certain buyers can support a technology when it‚Äôs more expensive than alternatives in the market, which provides an initial push down the cost curve.

At the same time that it became harder and more expensive to test and iterate, two important premium buyers dramatically cut spending. </p><p>Taken together, these factors seem to explain why TFP fell off in 1973 more than the idea that ideas have gotten harder to find. There are more, but these make the point. </p><p>Which brings us back to the question: why are people building things again now? </p><p>Here‚Äôs my hypothesis: </p><p>Ideas have gotten more expensive not to discover, but to build, at the same time that demand for premium versions of things slowed their spending. That meant that the initial push down the cost curve never happened, which meant that ideas remained more expensive to implement, which means they never got to the normal part of the demand curve. </p><p>Now, two things are happening. </p><ol><li><p>Technology is making old and new ideas cheaper and easier to build. </p></li><li><p>There‚Äôs a reemergence of ‚Äúpremium demand.‚Äù </p></li></ol><h3><strong>Ideas Need Adoption to Make an Impact</strong></h3><p><strong>Ideas alone are not enough. They need to be techno-economically viable, buildable for a low enough cost that the market is able to adopt them. There is no progress without adoption. </strong></p><p>Premium demand can help technologies that have a path to market viability reach that point. It‚Äôs a bridge. It‚Äôs not charity, or even grants. These products offer capabilities that no other products do and for which the government and Big Tech are willing to pay higher prices to access those capabilities. </p><p>Big Tech is buying nuclear power out of its own selfish interests, and the AI it produces may show up in TFP growth, but nuclear power won‚Äôt have a large direct impact on TFP while it sits behind the meter powering data centers. That will come as a result of building and manufacturing more reactors and bringing them down the learning curves. Until then, it has powerful, deep-pocketed, and motivated allies to help fight the costly hurdles in its way. </p><p>The same can be said for capabilities that the DoD might buy ‚Äì whether drones or supersonic planes ‚Äì which will show up first in the military context and diffuse to consumers as companies scale up manufacturing and bring down costs. NASA and the DoD were the premium demand for SpaceX‚Äôs early launch; now, the benefits can be felt by anyone who uses Starlink to access the internet. </p><p>For a certain set of technologies, this bridge is critical. But something else is happening, too. </p><p>Despite the slowdown, technological progress has marched on. Compared to 1973, entrepreneurs have a cornucopia of lower-cost, higher-performance technologies at their disposal with which to build. AI, CRISPR, batteries, solar, software, launch, materials, sensors, and an ever-expanding list of inputs continue to improve and get cheaper. </p><p>Atom Limbs‚Äô AI prosthetic is possible, at a price the market will pay, because of advances in sensors, actuators, batteries, and machine learning. </p><p>Longshot Space uses advanced control systems to inject gas directly behind the projectile as it moves down the barrel at sub-millisecond precision, a capability that Gerald Bull could only have dreamed of. Plus, the DoD is a potential early customer for Longshot‚Äôs hypersonic capabilities, which would help fund the development of the ultimate mission of launching mass into space more cheaply and helping humans, and our progress, scale beyond earth. </p><p>Almost any 1950s or 1960s idea that‚Äôs being brought back to life today benefits from dramatic cost and performance improvements compared to the technology available at the time. </p><p>Perhaps what‚Äôs happening is that those cost declines have outrun the cost increases from regulation and other countervailing forces put up over the past fifty years. More simply: it all comes down to economics. The factors for and against progress can be boiled down to the all-in costs to turn ideas into scaled products, and whether there are enough buyers willing to pay more than that cost. </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ad54ad39-32b3-472c-987f-1a567ed6e272?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7041674a-f4e1-4749-ba09-2c26d32f343c_908x591.png"></a><figcaption><em>Technology and Scale Can Push the Price of Ideas Down to Adoption</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>A counterpoint might be that there‚Äôs a lot of economic interest behind scaling Moore‚Äôs Law or improving crop yields, and yet, new impactful ideas in those fields are getting harder to find.
