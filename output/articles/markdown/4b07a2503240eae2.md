**Description:** Today, we’re launching Nest Hub Max. Hub Max is a Google Assistant smart display that’s the perfect addition to your helpful home—it’s a TV for your kitchen, an indoor camera, a smart home controller, a digital photo frame and a great way to make video calls. It comes in chalk and charcoal for $229 in the U.S. on the Google Store, as well as retailers such as Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and more; it’s also available in the U.K. for £219 and Australia for AUS$349. To give you a glimpse of how Hub Max can be helpful in your household, we gathered the top 101 ways we’ve been using Nest Hub Max in our own homes:

Get entertained
1. Launch your favorite channels through your YouTube TV subscription by saying, “Hey Google, watch [channel]” to enjoy live TV while you finish the dishes.2. Catch up on the news, sports and your favorite TV shows with a YouTube TV subscription that provides access to 70+ channels—no cable box required. Not sure what to watch? Ask your Assistant, “What’s on TV?”3. You can also enjoy other entertainment services you’re subscribed to using just your voice, including CBS All Access and Starz. 4. Stream thousands of apps from your phone to your Hub Max with built-in Cast functionality. Just open the Chromecast-enabled app on your phone and tap the Cast button.5. Enjoy millions of YouTube videos, from original content to cooking clips to how-to videos. 
6. Jam to your favorite tunes on Hub Max’s stereo speakers from services like YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and more.7. Set your favorite music service as your default listening app, so the Google Assistant will search there first when you ask it to play a song.8. Get personalized recommendations on the home screen with Face Match. Just tap the screen to see suggested videos, music, news and podcasts, just for you.9. Can’t decide which playlist or station is right to set the mood? Just say, “Hey Google, open Spotify” or “Hey Google, open YouTube Music.”10. Need a groove to get you ready for a night out? Say, “Hey Google, play smooth jazz" or pick another genre you like. 11. Don’t want to yell over the music? Use Quick Gestures to pause or resume music, videos and other content—just look at Hub Max and raise your hand.12. Group Nest Hub Max with other smart displays, speakers and Chromecast devices to fill your entire home with music.13. Catch up on the news of the day from a variety of top sources. Just say, “Hey Google, play the news” to get started. 14. For live updates from specific news outlets, just say, “Hey Google, play CBS News” or another outlet.15. Want to learn more about what’s happening within a specific topic? Ask “Hey Google, show me the sports news,” for example. 16. Customize your news by selecting from some of your favorite sources, including hundreds of national and local broadcasters. 17. Control thousands of entertainment devices from all major brands in your home from your Hub Max.18. Lost the remote? Turn your Chromecast built-in TV on or off with a simple, “Hey Google, turn off the TV.”

Stay connected
19. Make video calls to family and friends with Nest Hub Max using Google Duo—and not just to other Hub Max devices, but also to any Android or iOS device.
20. Stay in view during a video call with auto-framing, so you can prep dinner around the kitchen while you catch up with loved ones.21. Don’t have time for a call? Leave a video message. Say “Hey Google, leave a video message for John” or send a video message from the Duo app on your phone.22. With Face Match, just walk up to Hub Max and your Assistant will let you know about any video messages or missed calls you've received.23. Create reminders for other members of your household, like reminding your partner to walk the dog. Face Match will also surface any missed reminders automatically when they approach Hub Max.24. You can also use reminders to send someone a note of encouragement when they need it the most (“Hey Google, remind Kathy that she’ll do great in tomorrow’s interview”).25. Use Hub Max’s built-in Nest Cam to check in on your pet when you’re not at home. 26. Use Talk and Listen through the Nest Cam to say a quick hello.27. Get continuous video recording, familiar face alerts and more with a Nest Aware subscription.

Keep the memories alive

Create a Live Album so your best and latest shots show up on your Hub Max automatically. Just choose the people (or pets) you want to see.32.

Share it with one of your contacts: “Hey Google, share this photo with Mom.”34. See an old memory and can’t remember the location? Just ask “Hey Google, where was this photo taken?”35. Or say, “Hey Google, favorite this photo” to keep track of the shots you love in the Google Photos app.36.

Get help in the kitchen
37. Discover recipes and see visual step-by-step directions—all hands-free—making Nest Hub Max your digital sous chef to help unleash your culinary creativity. 38.
