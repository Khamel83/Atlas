# Differences in the Quran treatment of the themes from the Book of Genesis Marginal Revolution

**Source:** [https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/03/differences-in-the-quran-treatment-of-the-themes-from-the-book-of-genesis.html](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/03/differences-in-the-quran-treatment-of-the-themes-from-the-book-of-genesis.html)  
**Folders:** Feedly  
**Description:** 1. There are more angels.

2. Satan plays a larger role.

3. There is virtually no literary suspense.

4. Adam is not made in God’s image.

5. There is considerably less complexity of narrative perspective.

6. Allah does not speak directly, rather it is all coming from Allah.

7. Noah is more of a prophet of doom, and Abraham (“the first Muslim”) is a more important figure.

8. The Abraham story is more central.

9. Isaac is aware that he is slated for sacrifice, and accepts his fate.  (That he is not killed of course you can think of as an “alternative” to the Christ story, namely that the blessed do not have to undergo a brutal, ugly death.)

10. The covenant with God is not national or regional in its origins.

For those points I drew upon my interpretations of Jack Miles, God in the Qu’ran, among other sources.
