The Instant Pot was the kitchen toy to give and get this holiday season, but their black-box vibe can be a little intimidating at first. If you’re slightly overwhelmed with all those buttons and functions, just breathe deeply, and embrace the “safety in numbers” approach of an Instant Pot Facebook group.

Like any appliance with a cult following, there are a ton of online groups available, ranging from the vague and expansive to the extremely specific. These groups are huge—expect to read the word “hubby” a good bit—and they’re an excellent resource for general advice, tasty tips, and (of course) recipes. (You will have to request membership to join most of them but, if they’ll accept the likes of me, you should have no problem getting in.) Here are a few of our favorites:

Instant Pot Beginner Recipes and Tips: This group is great for crowd-sourcing recipes, getting a grip on all those buttons and soothing your newbie jitters.

Instant Pot Recipes—Tried and True!: As the name would suggest, the recipes posted in this group are ones that have been made and thoroughly enjoyed by members. They’re conveniently separated by thread, with straightforward topics like “breakfast,” “vegetables,” and “chicken.”

Instant Pot Vegan Recipes: Everyone should eat more vegetables, and you don’t have to be vegan to enjoy all of the creative plant-based recipes offered in this group.

Instant Pot Vietnamese Food Recipes: Quick, flavorful pho is the only reason you need to join this group, but be sure not too sleep on the Bo Kho, sticky rice, and milk tea.

“Dump and Push Start” Easy Instant Pot Recipes: This group features only the easiest “fix-and-forget” recipes for unfussy, single-appliance meal making.

Instant Pot for Indian Food: The Instant Pot makes short work of grains, legumes, and intensely-flavored sauces, lending itself extremely well to Indian cuisine. As someone who wishes to wean herself off of takeout, I find this group extremely exciting.

That should be enough to get you going and, of course, feel free to leave any IP successes in the comments below. I’m still extremely into these short ribs.
