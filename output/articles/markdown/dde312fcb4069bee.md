**Source:** [https://qz.com/1081262/the-fall-guide-to-watching-the-best-of-us-tv-for-cord-cutters/](https://qz.com/1081262/the-fall-guide-to-watching-the-best-of-us-tv-for-cord-cutters/)  
**Folders:** Feedly  
**Description:** It’s autumn in the US and, along with pumpkin lattes and warm sweaters, it means the return of scores of TV shows for audiences to watch, or more likely, DVR and binge-watch later.

But with so many people cutting the cord and abandoning cable, the fall-TV season isn’t just for pay-TV subscribers any longer. We’re living in a golden age of programming, and there are just as many shows available on streaming services as there are on traditional TV channels. There’s even American football on Amazon this year.

Netflix

Fan-favorites like Narcos and BoJack Horseman returned to Netflix earlier this month. The streaming service also premiered American Vandal, which spoofs the true-crime series like Making a Murderer that Netflix helped popularize. More series are on the way over the next few months, including the highly-anticipated second season of Stranger Things.

Fuller House, Sept. 22 – The revived family sitcom is back for a third season.

Suburra, Oct. 6 – A thriller about corruption and organized crime set in Rome that is Netflix’s first Italian original series.

Other subscription video on-demand services

If you haven’t had your fill yet, there are a litany of other streaming-video-on-demand services peddling new shows this fall. Chief among them is CBS All Access, which will premiere its long-awaited Star Trek series.

Star Trek Discovery (CBS All Access), Sept. 24 – The first episode will air on CBS, which is available for free via an antenna or through a pay-TV provider. But future episodes will only air for cord-cutters on CBS All Access.

Quite a few UK shows will premiere in the US this year too, thanks to streaming services like BritBox and Acorn TV. Cold Feet and an upcoming BBC drama Broken will hit BritBox, and dramas including The Governor, Doc Martin, and Newton’s Law—an Australian show—are a few of those you can catch on Acorn TV this fall.

CBS All Access is a $5.99-a-month platform. BritBox is $6.99 a month and Acorn TV is $4.99 a month. YouTube Red is is $9.99 a month.

Don’t forget all the free TV

Let’s not forget, there are still plenty of TV shows out there that cord-cutters can watch for free. They’re on broadcast TV. And you can access them through a digital antenna, which runs from $10 to $150 and will grant you access to live broadcasts from networks like ABC, CBS, the CW, Fox, and NBC.

Entertainment Weekly has a full list of the shows you can find in primetime this fall.

VIDEO

New TV episodes will soon be streaming soon, too

If you don’t have an HD antenna or pay-TV package, you can still stream some of the most sought-after shows on broadcast and cable TV, like The Walking Dead, The Big Bang Theory, and the new Will & Grace. You just may have to wait.

CBS All Access will get you new and old episodes of all the new and current CBS shows like The Big Bang Theory, Kevin Can Wait, NCIS, and Criminal Minds, and even allow you to watch them live.

Some new episodes of shows from broadcasters like ABC, Fox, and NBC, such as Dancing With the Stars, This Is Us, and Empire, head to Hulu the day after they air on TV. Others are added to the service after the full season has aired. And some cable shows like AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead and FX’s You’re the Worst and American Horror Story hit Hulu, before subsequent seasons premiere on TV.

New episodes of shows on the CW also come to Netflix a week after the seasons wrap on TV in the US. So you’ll be able to catch new episodes of shows like The Flash, Supernatural, and Riverdale sometime in 2018. (Lucky viewers in regions like the UK and Australia will reportedly be able to watch new episodes on Netflix shortly after they air on TV.) Netflix also usually gets new seasons of top AMC shows like The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul before the next season begins; season seven of The Walking Dead is up on the service now ahead of its Oct. 22 debut.

With a little patience, you can catch most of the season’s TV offerings without signing up for a costly pay-TV bundle.
