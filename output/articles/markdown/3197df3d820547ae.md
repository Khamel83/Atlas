It’s been 4.5 years since I used this newsletter. I tell you with a mostly straight face that social media is of the devil and I put Substack under that blanket as well, but horses for courses. </p><p>The course I’m currently horsing is trying to write another novel, so I’m getting the rust off this here substack and maybe occasionally (monthly? IDK) posting something visible and public. Because I like you am a bramble of contradictions, the public writing will probably be only somewhat scrutable and thus self-defeating. But it will exist, and it will mostly be me celebrating art that gets me good and making jokes.</p><div><div><div><p>Thanks for reading no coast offense!

I left the mayor spot blank because Walt is going to win again no matter way but I don’t want him thinking too well of himself.</p><p><span>So I noticed recently and repeatedly that we live in a season of A Lot of Shit. I was talking to a guy at the dog daycare about how he sold his Teslas because the Tesla man is awful.

Anyway in the the poopy latitudes we’re swimming, I find myself occasionally tuning in only to realize I desperate want to tune back out and wash my brain with lye.</span></p><p><span>Something that gave me a draught of peace was a tidbit from Fr Richard Rohr about Step 4 and searching and fearless moral inventories. It is good to remember that, regardless of where you sit re: </span><em>christ is dead, christ is risen, christ will come again</em><span>, that the goal is not perfect avoidance of sin but just </span><a href="https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/c3f28f0e-5542-43ff-8e1c-d277f436a297?j=eyJ1IjoiOWtuNDQifQ.ooynrtFo0hAEil22Vv3itqWd1CEfVvfNqmKxsvOryBI">trying</a><span>.

Remember that the law (moral law) was at least partially given to remind you how wrong you are about things. The government law is a different kettle of turds, but I feel like letting those turds spike your blood pressure and shoplift your hope is cowardly.</span></p><p>The truth will set you free but it will also beat the s-word out of you before undoing the ropes. I personally need the humiliation that comes from witnessing our shared and individual failure and frailty. Passim toni morrison, if you want to fly you gotta give up the s-word that weighs you down. So: where will you put all your s-word?  </p><p>A speed-run of things that got me good this year:</p><ul><li><p>Thornton Dial, all of him</p></li><li><p><span>Alexis Wright specifically </span><em>Praiseworthy</em></p></li><li><p><span>Nora Lange </span><em>Us Fools</em></p></li><li><p>RaMell Ross, all of him</p></li><li><p><em>Yi Yi</em><span> by Edward Yang</span></p></li><li><p>Chat Pile (loud music)</p></li><li><p>Melenas (less loud)</p></li><li><p>Water Damage (loud again)</p></li><li><p>lucille clifton</p></li><li><p>parenting, esp moments like your 2.5 year old daughter running through the house naked yelling “no touch wiener icky” or your 3.9 year old son saying grownups shouldn’t drink coffee or Coca Cola because it’s too spicy and not healthy </p></li></ul><p>in the meantime, remember that “All writing is garbage.
