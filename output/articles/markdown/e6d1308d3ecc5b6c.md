I think it’s pretty safe, at this point, to say that this extreme weather is caused in part by climate change. We’re not going to get in the mud on what causes climate change or propose political solutions for addressing it, but we are optimistic that there are technologist and researchers working on solutions right now that will mitigate both the causes and effects of climate change in the future.</span></p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p><strong><span>Today’s Weekly Dose is brought to you by… </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f5184fba-ee20-4f5b-a9ad-edb0ad45e30c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Tegus</a></strong></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/751f2a18-3f22-4440-ba44-ec70b575f75c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcec9161f-f9de-40b4-b639-28f7348eda4f_1200x630.png"></a></figure></div><p><em><span>There’s only a small handful of tools I use every time I write a Deep Dive. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f5184fba-ee20-4f5b-a9ad-edb0ad45e30c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Tegus</a><span> is one.

You just love to see it.</p><p>The FDA just gave accelerated approval to Adaptimmune's Tecelra, the first engineered T cell therapy to tackle solid tumors. Unlike traditional CAR-T therapies, which have primarily been effective against blood cancers, Tecelra employs TCR-T cells capable of recognizing and attacking tumors from the inside out by targeting intracellular proteins.</p><p>While Tecelra is designed to fight synovial sarcoma specifically, the FDA’s approval opens the floodgate for treating a variety of stubborn solid tumors. Right now, there are over 30 clinical trials underway for similar TCR therapies. TCR is unique in that it recognizes and attacks cancer cells by targeting specific internal proteins displayed on the cancer cell surface, unlike other therapies that only target proteins on the outside of cells. Cancers destroyed from within. These therapies can be both tailored to specific cancer-types and personalized to individual patients.</p><p>We love to see a good accelerated approval from the FDA, especially for a treatment against a disease like synovial sarcoma that has a just a 50% five-year survival rate.

But the exact reason may not be as intuitive as you think.</p><p>A study of nearly 1,000 mice found that while calorie restriction and intermittent fasting led to weight loss and improved metabolism, these factors did not directly correlate with increased lifespan. Instead, mice longevity was more closely linked to traits like immune health, red blood cell function, and genetic resilience to the stress of reduced food intake…meaning the life-extending benefits of calorie restriction are driven by factors beyond just metabolic changes.</p><p>The takeaway: enhancing your resilience and immune function may be more critical for extending lifespan than simply cutting calories. Combine the two: eating less + bolstering your body’s immune system and you might just turn into Bryan Johnson.</p><p><em>Wang et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Solution-processable semiconductors hold promise in enabling applications requiring cost-effective electronics at scale but suffer from low performance limited by defects.

The two-hour pod covered the semiconductor industry from top to bottom: etching specialization all the way up to the geopolitical implications of chip manufacturing. Highly, highly recommend listening. And while I feel a bit smarter on chips after listening, what was made abundantly clear to me was that chips are super, super complex — likely the most complex thing that we humans make — and that neither I, nor anyone in the world, really has a complete understanding of the full-stack. So take my summary of this new chips breakthrough with a grain of salt:</span></p><p>Researchers have created a new semiconductor material called CuIn₅Se₈ that can be produced cheaply and in large quantities. Surprisingly, they improved its performance by deliberately adding and organizing defects inside the material, which actually helps electricity flow more efficiently. Talk about turning a weakness into a strength. This breakthrough overcomes previous limitations of defective materials, enabling the creation of high-performance electronics like faster computer circuits and sharper display screens at a lower cost.</p><p>I’m not exactly sure if and when this material will flow into chip commercialization, but especially after listening to that podcast, I have a newfound appreciation for all of the research and work that goes into chips and the importance of seemingly little breakthroughs like have in pushing the industry forward.</p><p><em>Tim De Chant for TechCrunch</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Zap is taking a unique approach to fusion power known as sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch.

Sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch — that’s a mouthful — sends an electric current through a plasma stream to generate a magnetic field that compresses the plasma—leading to fusion—without the need for the most cutting-edge magnets or highest-powered lasers.
