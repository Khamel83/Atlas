Today is likely one of the least productive non-holiday days of the year ‚Äî the Friday of opening weekend of March Madness. Listen, I get it. There‚Äôs something about March Madness. I can go a full 4-5 months of not watching a lick of college basketball and then, suddenly, get pulled in for 12 hours of straight action during opening weekend. But before we all go and do that, there‚Äôs some light reading we need to do on all the optimistic stuff going on in the world.</span></p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it.</p><p><strong><span>Today‚Äôs Weekly Dose is brought to you by‚Ä¶ </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/0e97e29c-0056-4904-b93e-dd876095b301?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Create</a></strong></p><p>At this point, if you‚Äôre not taking creatine I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

In </span><em>Abundance</em><span>, Thompson and Klein, two of the more influential progressive pundits of the last decade, call for a proactive government to unlock supply and make goods and services more abundant and affordable.</span></p><p>The Abundance Agenda is the ideological first cousin of, what I‚Äôll call, our Optimism Agenda. Both believe that the future can be better ‚Äî that we can progress ‚Äî and that individuals and organizations have agency in bringing about that future. And at the core of each agenda is action ‚Äî in order for society to progress, we need to take more action and we need to build more.</p><p>Abundance is also, as far as I can tell, the leading and most compelling vision for America‚Äôs new Democratic Party. The Democratic Party, at least in theory, stands for a social safety net, economic equality, civil rights, and progressive policies on healthcare, climate change, and education. These outcomes are the same desired outcomes of the Abundance Agenda. But the Abundance Agenda offers a new roadmap for how we can achieve them. Whether or not the Democratic Party or a compelling Democratic politician fully embraces that roadmap is still very much TBD. I, for one, hope they do.</p><p><span>Perhaps no ideological theory has been written about more ‚Äî directly or indirectly ‚Äî in the </span><em>Weekly Dose of Optimism </em><span>than the Abundance Agenda. Now, thankfully, that entire theory is presented to us in a full book. We encourage you to go out, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ea46ba47-766d-465c-8966-ad642a9e5869?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">buy it</a><span>, and read it.</span></p><p><em>Ian King for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The lineup includes a successor to Nvidia‚Äôs flagship AI processor called the Blackwell Ultra, as well as additional generations stretching into 2027.

If you‚Äôve never been or haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs an absolutely massive (and overwhelming) display of the latest CPG innovations and trends. Think protein-everything, functional sodas, newfound supplements‚Ä¶think creatine gummies. The Expo has gotten bigger and bigger each year, in line with both consumer demand for better-for-you options and the growing consumer realization that our food system in the U.S. is pretty fucked. And despite all of the showcasing brands and all of the hype, the truth is that a few companies in the country still drive the vast majority of purchasing volume. The top five firms‚ÄîNestl√©, PepsiCo, The Kraft Heinz Company, General Mills, and Unilever ‚Äî control a substantial portion of the market. And I think it‚Äôs wrong to view these companies as evil. It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre operating in a system with poorly aligned incentive structures and serving consumers that have been poorly educated.  </p><p>There‚Äôs really two ways to change this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Government Intervention: </strong><span>The government can come in and mandate certain protocols and requirements and restrictions. The U.S. government has, for better or worse, been pretty laissez faire on this front historically. One of the hopes of the new Administration is that RFK‚Äôs MAHA agenda will take a more front footed approach to policing Big Food. I am all for banning Red 40 in my chips. But I don‚Äôt necessarily want RFK telling me exactly what I can and cannot indulge in.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Trends + Product Innovation: </strong><span>The other way to change the system is to change consumer demand and then offering consumers new products that better align with that new demand. All easier said than done. How do you change consumer demand? A mix of education, scare tactics, marketing, expanded distribution, and product innovation.</span></p></li></ol><p>The company highlighted in the Bloomberg article, Pepsico, presents a good example how both agents of change are acting out in the real world. Fears of the governments potential regulation is forcing the company to proactively remove food dangerous dyes from its chips and eventually its entire product portfolio. And just this week, the company finalized a deal to acquire emerging BFY soda company Poppi for $1.95B ‚Äî a signal that Pepsico knows there is growing and potentially canniballizing demand for a healthier soda option than its Pepsi pops. Pepsico is a co, and they don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre spending money slurping sugary sodas or potentially gut healing beverages, as long as your spending money with them. </p><p><em>Elliot Hershberg for Century of Bio</em></p><blockquote><p><em>But I want you take a leap with me that will potentially annoy some drug developers: no discovery technology is immune from the inescapable pull towards commoditization‚Äîlike virtually every other technology. For big and small molecules alike, once discovery technologies‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs high-throughput screening, in silico screening, in vitro or in vivo models, or an analytical assay‚Äîbecome standardized, companies around the world will compete to offer them as a service. This is The Long Arc of Modality Commoditization. Over time, revolutionary ideas become universal building blocks for the next wave of innovation.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/85415a75-cee4-4d1c-8923-cda129c6d35a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1909180e-8c37-4393-97af-0ff35ed9064b_1232x928.png"></a></figure></div><p><span>Packy again.

So we hit the trifecta here. And this is legitimately one of my favorite Elliot essays, a glimpse into what makes him so good. </span></p><p><span>He argues that as drug discovery technologies get commoditized (today, drug discovery is happening on the cheap in China, and US Pharma is sourcing molecules there), biotech may have to compete more like traditional businesses. Instead of relying on a Cornered Resource in the form of IP as its only moat, biotech companies will need to </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c92a8517-6b3d-442a-a238-e2c0b116482f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">dig moats</a><span> like the rest of us. Because of data flywheels in algorithm-designed drugs, we may see the first drugs that benefit from Network Economies. Process Power and Brand are also on the </span><em>7 Powers </em><span>table. </span></p><p>But Elliot also thinks there‚Äôs an opportunity for new entrants to use modern technology to take on sclerotic (a word I stole from him) Pharma incumbents and ‚Äúestablish themselves as an entirely new generation of pharmaceutical company.‚Äù In other words, he writes that we might start to see Bio Vertical Integrators. </p><p>As he points out, the path is a hard one. Capital formation will be hard. Doing a lot of things well, all at once, will be hard. Building a standalone business instead of selling assets to Big Pharma will be hard. But, he writes, ‚ÄúIf the companies solving these global problems establish moats in new ways, we could see the first $1T+ biotech firms come into existence.‚Äù</p><p>Long story short: commoditized drug discovery is good for those of us who take medicine to get healthy. And if it‚Äôs short-term painful for certain companies in the space, it may spur creative destruction in the industry that‚Äôs good for us all.</p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/de8b8935-854b-49c0-a38f-fb24c709e959?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ZPUtA3W-7_I"></a><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on Lex Fridman this week for a three hour long conversation about his life, worldview, India, and the state of the world today. Despite some fair criticisms, I‚Äôve long been an admirer of Modi, after all he is the leader of the largest democracy in human history and has done a pretty darn good job of governing India over the last 12 years. But, admittedly, I have never heard him talk before. He governs in Hindi and his mother tongue is Gujarati. Lex now does this cool thing, in partnership with Eleven Labs, to dub foreign language conversations into English in a way that seems to capture and translate the original essence of the conversation. You don‚Äôt really hear modern American politicians speak the way Modi does and its quite refreshing.
