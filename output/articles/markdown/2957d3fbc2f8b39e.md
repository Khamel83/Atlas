A desire to avoid court or otherwise go through the process on an expedited basis only when absolutely necessary. Everyone wants to keep the time (and expense) in chapter 11 to a minimum. All of which is made complicated by the fact that before a filing you do not even know the identity of the stakeholders that will likely challenge the restructuring, all of which is paid for by the company and the ultimate owners of the business. Out of court restructurings and liability management transactions (which have been around forever by the way), will continue.

This is a wildcard that can’t really be gamed because he tends to change his mind or backtrack on things he says he’ll do. At least that was true in his first term. There is no reliably predictable pattern of behavior that makes this knowable or estimable. Will the Trump presidency ultimately deport hundreds of thousands of migrants or several million? Will import tariffs really be 25% and will other countries retaliate? Who the heck knows!

In cross-border cases, there may be significant debate about whether (or how) Purdue Pharma applies to the question of whether nonconsensual third-party releases can (or should) be approved. Several cases hold that non-consensual third-party releases may be permissible under Chapter 15, but there may be avenues for creditors and other stakeholders to argue that such releases are categorically prohibited under Purdue or barred by the public policy exception under section 1506. However, (i) as made explicit in the Supreme Court’s opinion, the holding in Purdue is narrowly tailored to its own facts, (ii) the Court in Purdue was clear that its decision was a textual one not based on public policy; and (iii) though not binding precedent, some bankruptcy courts that have approved non-consensual third-party releases in recent Chapter 15 cases prior to Purdue Pharma have stated that even if non-consensual third-party releases are categorically prohibited under Chapter 11 by subsequent binding case law, that relief may nevertheless be appropriate under Chapter 15. Without express statutory authority under the Bankruptcy Code for approval of non-consensual third-party releases in Chapter 15 cases, however, stakeholders may use the Purdue Pharma decision to argue against such releases in Chapter 15 cases, and lower courts may reach differing conclusions on the issue.”</em></p><p><strong>Brett Miller</strong><span>: </span><em>“South America.

The initial question is who will tee up such a challenge and why. A challenge from a borrower seems unlikely because if the alleged “harm” caused by the cooperation agreement is that a borrower is not able to achieve as favorable a financing as it would otherwise, a distressed borrower seems unlikely to take the time to file a (regular, slow-moving) litigation challenging the co-op; to the contrary, a distressed borrower is more likely to seek out whatever financing is available to it and move on. By contrast, a challenge from an excluded lender seems somewhat more likely — possibly as an add-on claim in an excluded lender’s lawsuit following an LME.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Joshua Feltman (Partner and Chair of Restructuring &amp; Finance at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>I don’t thiiiiiink so? My gut is the time it would take to litigate is too long for it to be an effective tactic for the borrowers and the out of pocket costs to the lenders could be reasonably socialized among the co-op members in the short run (including leading lawfirms in the LM world bearing some risk) with a reasonable expectation of future reimbursement from the borrower in the long run. But definitely maybe … I don’t view it as a real argument, but you can imagine it as a real tactic that could affect lender willingness to compromise on the margin.”</em></p><p><strong>Ryan Preston Dahl</strong><span>: “</span><em>Great question!</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Sean O’Neal</strong><span>: “</span><em>I doubt it.</em><span>” </span></p><p><strong>Cullen Speckhart</strong><span>: “</span><em>Perhaps</em><span>.”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Eisenband</strong><span>: “</span><em>Hopefully not.

We will see private equity sponsors increasingly engage in LMEs opportunistically to trade covenant flexibility for debt discount, even in the absence of a catalyst (liquidity need, maturity, etc.) requiring a transaction. We will see lenders organize and sign cooperation agreements earlier and earlier to protect against potential LMEs, or at least ensure they are in the majority group. And we may see public companies start to become more comfortable engaging in LMEs.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Scott Greenberg</strong><span>: “</span><em>Yes — it’s not slowing down at all. And I think the move has been to make them more inclusive but tiered. Everyone participates — biggest folks at the best exchanges, and so on and so forth.”</em></p><p><strong>Erica Weisgerber</strong><span>: “</span><em>Liability management exercises will increase in 2025. Certain businesses — particularly those that rely on imports — will feel the impact of any forthcoming tariffs, which will increase the rate of restructurings generally — and from the company perspective, liability management transactions are typically a better way to deal with distress if possible. As for an evolution: after the initial wave of LMEs, we had started seeing a “kinder, gentler” LME, where excluded lenders were offered the opportunity to participate in the transaction on somewhat less favorable economics. I think what we’re starting to see is a growing disparity between the economics for the participating lenders and the economics for the excluded lenders. As that disparity gets larger and larger, it is likely to reignite another wave of litigation.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Josh Sussberg</strong><span>: “</span><em>Increase. While everyone likes to say we follow a play-book, there really is none. Professionals will continue to be creative and utilize the assets that exist in the underlying credit agreements to come up with new and novel ways to extend runway, access cash and potentially even discount. Every single time the industry is able to do that, it is a success. The narrative that 90+% of liability management transactions fail and result in a bankruptcy is exhausting. And simply wrong. If cash is accessed and runway is extended, by definition this is a success. Restructuring professionals do not control operational performance. We can simply create the opportunity and pathway for companies to breathe and have the opportunity to live to fight another day.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Damian Schaible</strong><span>: “</span><em>Increase or remain steady. Technology and deal dynamics will continue to evolve to permit even greater differential spreads between majority and minority creditors until (hopefully) creditors just get tired of it and coop up broadly and dare the sponsors to light money on fire with the deal away.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Joshua Feltman</strong><span>: “</span><em>Increase. The market will be hot in the first part of the new (old) administration, which will counterintuitively lead to more LM. Long-term rates ain’t coming down and budget blowouts and tariff risks are going to inspire people to get while the getting’s good: look out for “pre-distress LM” where highly- (but not obviously over-) levered companies agree to tighten covenants in exchange for relatively little discount but a whole lotta cash to the balance sheet at reasonable spreads.”</em></p><p><strong>David Meyer</strong><span>: “</span><em>LME continues to increase taken as a whole.  Continued extension of pro rata deals but with exceptions that will arise based on unique facts and circumstances.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Rachel Albanese</strong><span>: “</span><em>Increase in frequency; hopefully, decrease in gamesmanship.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Cullen Speckhart</strong><span>: </span><em>“It increases, but more double dipping in 2025.”</em></p><p><strong>Brian Resnick</strong><span>: “</span><em>Similar levels, but with expanding creativity and complexity, and an increasing amount of ‘dips’.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Handler</strong><span>: “</span><em>LMs may increase slightly. Third party financings may become more attractive if loans trade up and opportunity to capture discount declines.”</em></p><p><strong>Michael Eisenband</strong><span>: “</span><em>For all the talk about tightening up loan documents and incorporating various blockers in new deals since 2022, our sources indicate that lender protections in more recent deals are only modestly stronger at best, so there’s little reason to believe that LME transactions will moderate going forward. This is a cat-and-mouse game with sponsors, who often seem to figure out a workaround and have the negotiating upper hand in a borrower-friendly lending market.”</em></p><p><strong>Sanjeev Khemlani</strong><span>: “</span><em>Increases.
