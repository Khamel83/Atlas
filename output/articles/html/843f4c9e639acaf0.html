        <blockquote>A clever piece of social commentary, from sometime prior to 1937:

That's Brouette (wheelbarrow) no. 1, by the Paris-based Spanish surrealist artist Oscar Dominguez (1906-1957).

I found it on the website of the Paris Musées, a group of 14 museums in Paris that have now made roughly 100,000 images from across their collections available for free download.

As with all online collections like this, random browsing is time-consuming, but if you know exactly what you're searching for, it's a potential gold mine. For instance, if you're looking for images of what Parisian architecture looked like in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, there's tons of the stuff.
