Either way, it’s an odd bug that has created various incorrect answers in the past. The most memorable Siri fail was when it erroneously thought the Bulgarian national anthem was Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” before Apple quickly fixed the result.

A Wikipedia editor, speaking to The Verge over direct message, confirmed it was indeed vandalism at play, and from more than one editor. “They have now been blocked indefinitely,” the editor tells us. You can also observe the pubic Wikipedia edit history for Trump’s page to see the back and forth edit war.

Update 11/22, 6:05PM ET: Added comment from an editor of Wikipedia confirming the vandalism and informing us that the rogue editors have been blocked.</blockquote>
