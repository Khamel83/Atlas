        <blockquote>LinkedIn, Monster.com, and other job websites have revolutionized the way that companies look for new hires. But they’ve also made it easier for those companies to sort candidates based on factors like where they went to school and which companies they’ve worked at in the past—which can narrow the pool of candidates and contribute to diversity problems.

Dave Foley, the former leader of a global sales unit at LinkedIn, says that his hundreds of former customers were “typically looking at the same profile” in terms of schools and companies from which they were hoping to recruit. “Many as-good or better candidates are often overlooked because they don’t work or study in traditionally biased institutions like Harvard or McKinsey.”

In order to make it easier for hiring managers and recruiters to deemphasize attendance at top schools or career history, however, it helps to give them another way to quickly narrow down the candidate pool. That’s where the next generation of recruiting tools comes in.

Folely recently left LinkedIn to join one of a handful of companies that is working on creating metrics that assess candidates fairly, at scale. He is now the head of global sales at Pymetrics, a company that tests potential candidates on more than 90 emotional and cognitive traits such as attention, sequencing, planning, risk profile, reward profile and how to read emotion in others. It then compares the results to those of the company’s current, most successful employees in the role. (That helps zero in on candidates whose traits have helped others be successful at that particular job, within that particular company.)
