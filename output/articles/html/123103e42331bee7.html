I found flights from San Jose, California, to Honolulu for $189 one-way in coach.  And from San Francisco to Maui for $199 one-way in coach.

Buy Flights to Hawaii at a Discount Through October 3, 2017
1.   Alaska Airlines

Link:   Alaska Airlines Sale

Through October 2, 2017, you can buy select Alaska Airlines flights for as low as $42 one-way, though most fares are higher.  For example, I found a flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale for $97 one-way in coach on October 17, 2017.

Here are the details:

Sale ends at 11:59 pm Pacific Time on October 2, 2017

You must book travel at least 21 days in advance

Valid for travel Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, between October 17 and November 8, 2017

Sale applies to non-stop flights only

Tickets are non-refundable and are only available on flights marketed by Alaska Airlines for travel on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon Air, SkyWest, and PenAir

2.   Virgin America

Link:   Virgin America Sale

Virgin America is running practically the same exact sale with the same end date of October 2, 2017.  As an example, I found a flight from San Francisco to Denver for $69 one-way on October 17, 2017.

Here are the details of this sale:

Sale ends at 9:59 pm Pacific Time on October 2, 2017

You must book travel at least 21 days in advance

Valid for travel Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, between October 17 and November 8, 2017

These sales are mostly similar, with a few key differences:

The Virgin America sale ends 2 hours before the Alaska Airlines sale

Virgin America award prices are tied to the cash price of the seat.  So when there is a sale, it costs fewer points to book the flights.

Both sales have blackout dates, so check their landing pages to see if your travel dates are available!

Hotel Information

If you book a sale flight, remember there are lots of ways to get cheap or free hotel rooms with points from credit card bonuses and spending.

To find hotels that can be booked with points, I use Hotel Hustle (which even shows you if rooms are actually available!) or AwardMapper.

Remember, you can transfer flexible points like Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards to different hotel programs.  

Note:  If you prefer to book paid stays, check out discount sites like Orbitz, Expedia, or TravelPony for deals.  But remember you won’t get stay credits or points (and might not have your elite status recognized!).

Airbnb is another terrific way to save money on accommodations, especially for longer stays.  Here are some tips on how to negotiate a better Airbnb price, and how to find a safe and comfortable Airbnb.
