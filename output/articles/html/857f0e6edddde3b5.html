        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Here at TPG we spotlight stories from our readers — fantastic travel made possible with some savvy tips and tricks. In our new lounge on Facebook, TPG Lounge member Serenity Forbes shared some insights on navigating Disneyland in California. Do you have tips to share? If your story catches TPG’s eye and we publish it, we’ll send you a gift to jump-start your next adventure!

 

GENERAL ADVICE
Get there early — as close to opening time as possible. It sucks, but when you walk into Tomorrowland and no one is there, it’s pretty amazing. Some parts of the park are empty for the first few hours — mainly Critter Country and Small World; Toon Town is also empty when it opens, usually an hour after the park opens.

The Disneyland app is shockingly accurate and helpful, but I also use an app called Mousewait that gives better info for stuff like parade times and when rides will be shut down for maintenance and for how long.

PARKING 
Toy Story continues to be our preferred parking lot and shuttle to the park. There is less hassle than the parking structure/tram and the parking folks there are much friendlier. On a good day, the buses are lined up in a single line (instead of the amorphous blob of the Disneyland tram). No one really cuts in line and it’s a much more fair system.

FOOD
There are no restrictions for bringing in food, though they don’t allow glass containers or alcohol. We always pack a lunchbox full of sandwiches, fruit and hearty snacks to keep us full throughout the day. It saves so much money; you can also bring in empty water bottles and fill them up at drinking fountains all day.

There is a Starbucks on Main Street and while they don’t have a sign out front, if you go in (on the right side, halfway-down towards castle) they have a full Starbucks menu.

If you know you will be at the park on a certain day, you should make a dining reservation for somewhere like Blue Bayou. Dining reservations can be made six weeks in advance online and you can cancel up to one day before your reservation without being charged. (If you do eat at the Blue Bayou, request a table by the water.)

RIDES/ACTIVITIES/SHOWS
Map out what rides you want to hit; if they’re popular ones, you need to grab those fastpasses first and/or ride them first. On a typical Sunday morning at 8:15am, you can walk onto Space Mountain or wait a few minutes. Within an hour, the line is at least 45 minutes-long.

If you have small children, or kids who simply don’t want to ride a big kid ride, you can ask for a parent swap pass: It enables one parent to watch the small/unwilling children while the other rides. These swap passes are good all day; we like to save them for the afternoon when the ride lines are the longest. For almost every ride, you use a swap like a fastpass and parent swaps are available on any ride where there is a height requirement.

CHARACTERS
We always do Pixie Hollow first thing in the morning as the lines tend to be very long in the middle of the day, but at 9:00am on a Sunday, you maybe have to wait 5-10 minutes.

There are a handful of cast member entrances/exits to the park. One is by the bathrooms, nearby the rocket ships in Tomorrowland. If you hang out there, you will be guaranteed to see characters like Peter Pan, the Evil Queen, any of the princesses and Mary Poppins.

There’s also one at the very end of Critter Country, by the Splash Mountain exit. You will often seen Winnie the Pooh characters rotating in and out of there. There is also a character entrance/exit by the bathrooms next to the Disney Junior show in California Adventure, but the only characters you’ll see there are Disney Junior folks.

 

THE WEATHER
Rainy days aren’t what they used to be; I have seen rainy Sundays as busy as any other weekend. People assume rainy days and holidays (or even Super Bowl Sunday) would be a great time to visit, but they’re as bad or worse than other days. Check the isitpacked crowd forecaster for an idea of what the crowd levels will be like once you are there. It might help plan your day better; maybe get there early and ride rides all morning long and by late morning/early afternoon, you can do all the stuff you don’t really need to worry about lines for, like the Tiki Room and the Magical Map show.

There are a handful of places with reliable air conditioning to relax and beat the heat in Disneyland (Tiki Room, Main Street Cinema, Great Moments with Mr Lincoln, Star Wars Launch Bay) and California Adventure Park (Animation Academy). There are also water play areas in Bug’s Land; kids have to wear their shoes, but there are family bathrooms nearby to change into and out of swimsuits.

PARADES
If you plan on waiting for a parade, it is important to ask which direction it’s coming from — that will determine the best place to sit for the view. If you don’t care about the fireworks show, one of the best places for parade watching is in front of Small World; there’s no foot traffic so kids can run around in the parade area — and less people camp out there — making for good views in either direction.

The best place to watch the nighttime parade and have a great view of the fireworks is slightly to the right in front of the castle, at the junction of the road that heads up to the Matterhorn and the island where the Disney statue is. If the parade is coming from Small World, you will have an unobstructed view of the floats as they come down the road from the Matterhorn; after the parade, you can immediately shift your view to the castle and you should have a perfect view of the castle and fireworks.
