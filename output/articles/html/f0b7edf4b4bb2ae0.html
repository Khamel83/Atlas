When I say ‚Äúbelieved in God,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôve joined a Church. I‚Äôm not trying to convert you. I went out drinking with my friends this weekend and I said ‚Äúfuck‚Äù like a minute ago. I grew up Catholic and this is a very different experience.</p><p>I just kind of know that there‚Äôs a Universal Consciousness, that we‚Äôre all a part of it, and that the world is more magical than we‚Äôve been led to believe.</p><p>This is not my own idea. It‚Äôs not even a new idea. It‚Äôs a very old one. This is what Jesus was saying, and the Buddha, and Rumi. It is the Perennial Philosophy: all major religious and spiritual traditions ultimately point to the same universal truth or reality. I didn‚Äôt grok that at all until two weeks ago.</p><p><span>In 1945, Aldous Huxley (</span><em>the </em><span>Aldous Huxley), penned a book by that name, </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9405db7e-adbc-42b5-b9cc-4b7f3b192978?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Perennial Philosophy: An Interpretation of the Great Mystics, East and West</a></em><span>, writing:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The Perennial Philosophy is primarily concerned with the one, divine Reality substantial to the manifold world of things and lives and minds. But the nature of this one Reality is such that it cannot be directly and immediately apprehended except by those who have chosen to fulfill certain conditions, making themselves loving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit. Why should this be so? We do not know. It is just one of those facts which we have to accept, whether we like them or not.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Huxley‚Äôs anthology, which I only began reading after listening to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes</em><span>, is one of a growing library of books, videos, and experiences that all point in the same direction, back at the </span><em>Tapes.</em></p><p><span>My experiences over the past month, including but certainly not limited to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes,</em><span> have made me believe a few things:</span></p><ol><li><p>That God is real, whether you call it God, Universal Consciousness, or something else.</p></li><li><p>That Consciousness is fundamental, and that we are all a part of it.</p></li><li><p>That the world is on the verge of waking up to this truth.</p></li><li><p>The world is becoming more magical again as it does.</p></li></ol><p>Oddly, the best way to describe what I‚Äôm talking about is the Midwit Curve.</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1ebdd2b1-9e19-48d9-ab70-032caa7ddbe2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F910e7d7c-29ab-4b74-9dd3-15fd1b4593df_908x515.png"></a></figure></div><p>The Midwit Curve usually represents a comparison of different people at the same moment in time. The very low IQ person and the really high IQ person agree. The midwit ‚Äì the one just smart enough to overthink it ‚Äì overthinks it.</p><p>The left and right are driven by intuition; the midwit is driven by thought. The left and right realize they know nothing; the midwit thinks he knows everything. The left and right are unattached to their ideas; the midwit is crying trying to convince you his are right.</p><p>The real beauty of the midwit curve, though, is that while it presents as a static thing ‚Äì some people are just low IQ and some are just high IQ ‚Äì it‚Äôs also dynamic.</p><p>It‚Äôs a journey each of us goes through individually, and that we go through as a society.</p><p>We start out knowing nothing on the left, learn a lot from books and move to the middle, and then learn enough from experience, if we‚Äôre lucky, to end up on the right.</p><p>From intuition due to lack of alternatives, to reason, to intuition backed by knowledge.</p><p><strong>I think that's where we are: moving past the stranglehold of the dogmatic rational materialist paradigm ‚Äì the midwit ‚Äì and towards something both ancient and cutting-edge: a world where technology and magic coexist, where consciousness is as fundamental as matter, and where direct experience matters as much as double-blind studies.</strong></p><p>Another way to think of it is like this:</p><p>2024 was a techno-optimist‚Äôs dream.</p><p>SpaceX is catching skyscrapers with chopsticks, Google is borrowing quantum compute from parallel universes, AI keeps getting smarter, crypto has use cases, nuclear is back on the table, robots are folding laundry, cancer is under attack, autonomous vehicles are driving around, and even flying cars, the thing that we were supposed to get instead of 140 characters, are back on the menu. The 140 characters are humming, too. We did it, y‚Äôall.</p><p><strong>The future we were promised is finally here.</strong></p><p>It feels like we‚Äôre approaching technology‚Äôs end game. The Fukuyaman ‚ÄúEnd of Technology.‚Äù</p><p><span>Of course, we still need to build the things. We need to give the </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f51f0e16-b6b7-481e-9a42-ded45dde92e4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">curves</a><span> time to play out. But there is growing consensus on what the future looks like.</span></p><p>We will use atomic and solar energy to power abundance, travel at greater speeds with greater levels of autonomy across the globe, colonize the Moon, then colonize Mars. With gene and cell therapies, we will first cure disease, and then expand what the human body can do. Our agents will do mundane work for us, while we do art or whatever. They‚Äôll help accelerate progress in science and engineering, and speed up the inevitable arrival of Dyson Spheres and O‚ÄôNeill Cylinders and fully compliant humanoid servants with whom we will communicate via our Brain Computer Interfaces.</p><p>This all sounds like sci-fi, and a few years ago, people would have told you you were crazy for believing any of it, but now‚Ä¶ it seems kind of inevitable, right? A matter of when, not if.</p><p><strong>The fact that it seems so obvious, though, is a sign that it </strong><em><strong>won‚Äôt </strong></em><strong>play out like that.</strong></p><p>My hunch is that studying consciousness will add new and unpredictable richness to our capabilities, and set us down a new branch. </p><p>To be clear: this is just my own intuition, backed by a little knowledge and a lot of clues, as someone who is in the middle of my own ride down the backside of the Midwit Rollercoaster.</p><p><span>I do not have an airtight, falsifiable argument to support my intuition. I have a </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/97683e74-b416-4b8c-96ce-6bc5ea7159a9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">cumulative case</a><span>: individually imperfect pieces of evidence that, taken together, suggest something real. The cumulative case argument is also known as the </span><em>argument from the abundance of arguments</em><span>.</span></p><p>This piece has been the hardest for me to write of the entire year. Not in some spiritual or emotional way; in a literal way: there is just an abundance of individually half-baked arguments that I need to wrangle into something coherent.</p><p>Coherence may not be possible, so I‚Äôm just going to give you the stream.</p><p>By the end of the essay, I don‚Äôt want to have convinced you of anything.</p><p>I just want to spark some curiosity heading into the holiday break, and share some things to read, watch, and listen to during the slowness.</p><p>Maybe you‚Äôll feel that the world is a little more magical; maybe you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm crazy.</p><p><span>Maybe you‚Äôve been feeling the magic return yourself already and </span><em>you‚Äôll</em><span> feel a little less crazy.</span></p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to take you on my own personal journey to show you how I was convinced despite the absence of peer review. Then we‚Äôll talk a little bit about why now and what it might mean.</p><p>This is a starting point for what I hope is a much deeper exploration in the coming years, as consciousness and technology harmonize and we become more aware of the universe‚Äôs magic.</p><p>Shall we start with a synchronicity?</p><h3><strong>The PKD Synchronicity</strong></h3><p>One Friday night one month ago, after I put Dev and Maya to bed, I got cozy on the downstairs couch and turned on Jesse Michels‚Äô interview with Riz Virk:</p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bfda3427-36b8-46b6-88b3-602a45d545ce?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/aKZ_MUbuk_Q"></a><p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/50e84552-5941-4563-8b4d-58a86abf7c7a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Jesse</a><span> makes documentaries exploring consciousness, UAPs, and the nature of reality - his show, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bfcfca9f-5d19-4adc-bba7-5d136b9b7a4c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">American Alchemy</a><span>, is my only true must-watch. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/4e73d649-ff5b-40ca-a8d0-8f82891c4252?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Riz</a><span> is an MIT-trained scientist and game developer who theorizes that we live in a </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c91bedcf-12ec-4842-b120-d3ea948124a3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">simulated multiverse</a><span>.</span></p><p>There‚Äôs this 34 second clip from the video that I want you to watch:</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e09d4c64-bc85-4780-9148-a6769dfef919?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZ63pf33a-Zb2rxxCzcgUen1X6x6lAooB?si=yRnF4Qpgb6M7LqR4</a></p><p>Simulacra.

Welcome to the rest of the journey.</p><p><em>The Telepathy Tapes </em><span>is a documentary podcast by </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/283553f3-c6ca-4a0c-9375-9989c999d1d7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Ky Dickens</a><span> about non-verbal autistic kids.</span></p><p>It starts as a podcast about those kids‚Äô ability to communicate telepathically with their parents. Then with each other. Then, it‚Äôs about a range of special abilities that the kids have beyond telepathy.</p><p>It‚Äôs about the scientific establishment‚Äôs unwillingness to take their abilities seriously because they don‚Äôt fit within the materialist paradigm: the worldview that everything in existence can be explained solely by physical matter, measurable phenomena, and the laws of science (which, in turn, determines what kinds of studies get funded and published).</p><p>And it‚Äôs about the existence of God.</p><p>Again, I want you to listen and I don‚Äôt want to spoil it. But maybe there are a few things I can say without ruining it:</p><ul><li><p>In the first few episodes, Ky and Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell do a number of experiments to show that these non-verbal autistic children are able to communicate telepathically with their parents, and, less reliably, with others.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Ky and Dr. Powell do their best to make sure the tests are as clean as possible, although skeptics argue parents may be influencing them through touch or signals. More on the skeptics shortly.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><span>It is convincing enough that Puja and I (I made Puja listen with me a second time through) both </span><em><strong>got bored by the repeated successful tests of these kids‚Äô ability to read their parents‚Äô minds</strong></em><span>. It just became obvious they could could telepathically communicate.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It becomes clear that the non-speakers are able to communicate with each other in something many of them call ‚ÄúThe Talk on the Hill.‚Äù Parents from around the country independently report their kids telling them about ‚ÄúThe Talk on the Hill.‚Äù</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>As the episodes progress, the podcast reveals more abilities that certain of the non-speakers have, including precognition, remote sensing, and the ability to learn in their sleep.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Many of the non-speakers say that they go to heaven or the ‚Äúrealms‚Äù on certain nights, where they meet with the great minds of history and learn. They come back with knowledge that is inexplicable to their parents.</p></li></ul><p><span>The experiences they claim to have mirror the Perennial Philosophy, and perhaps they are able to access them because, as Huxley would say, their condition makes them</span><em> ‚Äúloving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit.‚Äù</em><span> Why should this be so? I do not know.</span></p><p>To show you what I mean, I‚Äôm going to share one quote with you, because it‚Äôs central to my case but not central enough to the podcast to spoil it for you.</p><h3><strong>Asher‚Äôs Information Field</strong></h3><p>In Episode 9, the one that got me, one of the non-speakers, Asher, talks ( through his teacher, Jess) about his visits to the Realms:</p><p><em><strong>Ky:</strong><span> Asher says that he visits a place called the Realms to access information about any topic. And he talked about a time when his former teacher, Jess, asked him about reincarnation. And he said:</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Asher (via Jess):</strong><span> Well, reincarnation, definitely, yes. But he said it isn't past lives because they're all happening at once, and we're all having all of our lives all of the time, but we're just not aware of that as 3D people. But they're all going on at once, and they interact with each other.</span></em></p><p><em><span>So if something happens in this lifetime and you suddenly get a eureka moment and you find something out that's wonderful and amazing that you hadn't known before, that will actually have repercussions in other lives because they're all interconnected. </span><strong>It's all parts of our soul exploring consciousness in different ways, and we're basically building up huge amounts of information.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Every new thought we have, every new idea we have is new information. And that way, we're expanding the cosmos because each new piece of information that we come up with then goes into this library of his and becomes available for everybody else. But we have to get this knowledge through direct experience in 3D life.</strong></em></p><p>I got goosebumps a number of times listening to the series. When I heard that, I shivered.</p><p>It rhymed with so much.</p><p><span>First, </span><strong>it really sounds like AI model training on a cosmic scale. </strong><span>Humans generate new knowledge, which the AI trains on. Synthetic data doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. We have to get this knowledge through direct experience in 3D life.</span></p><p>That‚Äôs nuts, right? A non-speaking autistic young man described a mechanism for the expansion of the cosmos that almost exactly mirrors the mechanism for the expansion of artificial intelligence.</p><p><span>Second, </span><strong>that‚Äôs just a beautifully expansive way to look at the human experience, isn‚Äôt it?</strong></p><p><span>Every new idea, every new direct experience we have expands the cosmos. Each of us is a different way for consciousness to explore itself and expand. It makes life intrinsically meaningful, no matter how you live it, while also making life </span><em>more </em><span>meaningful the more fully you live it ‚Äì the more ideas and experiences and emotions you have.</span></p><p>It even gives a direction to progress and technology: the more people who can live and have more and richer experiences, the better. Growth is good. More energy is good. Expansion among the stars is good. Medicine is good. Whatever increases the number and diversity of lives is good.</p><p>Stop it right here, just assume that Asher is making this all up: it‚Äôs still a deeply impressive and profound insight.</p><p><span>But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs making it up, because third: </span><strong>the connections.</strong></p><p><span>I‚Äôve been on a side quest for nearly two years to try to better understand reality a little better, through sci-fi like </span><em>Hyperion Cantos, </em><span>religious philosophy like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin‚Äôs </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man</em><span>, a little Iain McGilchrist, Aldous Huxley‚Äôs </span><em>The Perennial Philosophy, </em><span>Paramahansa Yogananda‚Äôs </span><em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em><span>, Donald Hoffman‚Äôs work on consciousness, and a lot of American Alchemy, among other things.</span></p><p><strong>Asher, a non-speaking young man in England, explained the cosmos in much the same way all of those thinkers, writers, priests, sages, and even physicists throughout history have, in his own unique and novel way.</strong></p><h3><strong>Cosmic Connections</strong></h3><p>That Asher quote was the moment when my belief bit flipped from 0 to 1.</p><p>It all just clicked. It all made sense. It all lined up eerily well. God is real.</p><p>I want to give you the sense of how and why it clicked so instantaneously, after two years of reading and exploring these ideas.</p><p><span>Hearing a non-speaker, someone society had basically assumed was not smart, describe the ideas I‚Äôd seen in so many disparate sources </span><em>based on his own experience</em><span> was like finding detailed quantum mechanics equations carved into ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs or a sealed cave with perfectly accurate maps of the modern world inside or a remote tribe that had independently discovered the Transformer architecture.</span></p><p>When completely separate paths lead to the same profound truth, you have to consider that they're both discovering something real.</p><p>So what are those ideas? I‚Äôll try to make some of the connections.</p><p><strong>Asher describes the universal consciousness as a field of information that we feed through our lived experience and knowledge, and describes our lives as our souls exploring this consciousness.</strong></p><p><span>That sounded a lot like the place where I started this journey into consciousness almost two years ago.

It </span><em>felt </em><span>true. But it was sci-fi; a good starting point, not an answer.</span></p><p><span>Through </span><em>Hyperion</em><span>, I also discovered Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

So I stopped and read something else.</p><p>When I opened it back up in my Kindle, this was the page I‚Äôd left off eight months ago:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ffd234c8-1a68-4f7a-bcae-41e93ca3ef1f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1366,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c3d2aa7-c46f-44bb-93f7-9c1daa00988d_683x908.png"></a><figcaption><em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Certainly, in a book about a Yogi, it‚Äôs not so bizarre to find a page like this. But in all 300 pages, this is the one that is </span><em>most </em><span>aligned with </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes:</em><span> human broadcasting stations, ‚Äútransferred his thoughts effectively to another person,‚Äù ‚Äúantenna of intuition,‚Äù ‚Äúall thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos,‚Äù ‚Äúdetect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead.‚Äù Come on! </span></p><p>Like de Chardin, Paramahansa Yogananda even talks about communications technology as an intimation that man is an all-pervading spirit! Come ON!</p><p><span>The one line on the page that I didn‚Äôt highlight, the last one which spills over to the next page, I didn‚Äôt think was </span><em>as</em><span> relevant until I started writing this piece. Now that I‚Äôm re-reading it, here it is:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>‚Äú</span><strong>Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena may yet appear, which, when once established, will not astonish us more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us during the last century,</strong><span>‚Äù Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in physiology, has declared.</span></em></p><p><em>‚ÄúIt is assumed that the phenomena which we now accept without surprise, do not excite our astonishment because they are understood. But that is not the case. If they do not surprise us, it is not because they are understood, it is because they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to surprise us, we should be surprised at everything‚Äîthe fall of a stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet.</em></p><p><em><span>The science of today is a light matter....Those amazing truths that our descendants will discover are even now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak; and yet we do not see them. </span><strong>But it is not enough to say that we do not see them; we do not wish to see them‚Äîfor as soon as an unexpected and unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of the commonplaces of accepted knowledge, and are indignant that anyone should dare to experiment further.‚Äù</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>I giggled when I read that. Nearly a century later, and we‚Äôre still saying the same thing.</p><p>So that‚Äôs my experience. Some synchronicities, a podcast, and a lot of connections. An abundance of arguments, none of which would hold much water individually, but all of which have combined to make me believe in something bigger and more magical.</p><p>Less than a month in, I am obviously at the beginning of that infinite journey, but it‚Äôs fun and very, very different from my experience growing up Catholic. I‚Äôd almost describe it as looking for magic all around.</p><p><span>Beyond myself, though, I get the sense that we‚Äôre at the beginning of a societal awakening, a </span><strong>Return of Magic.</strong></p><p><span>This year, 2024, set the stage. It‚Äôs the year the Vibe Shifted. In his In his year-defining essay, </span><span>Santiago Pliego wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Fundamentally, the Vibe Shift is a return to‚Äîa championing of‚ÄîReality, a rejection of the bureaucratic, the cowardly, the guilt-driven; a return to greatness, courage, and joyous ambition.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is the refusal to subordinate yourself and your family to the whims and anxieties of activists and bureaucrats and relearning to trust your eyes and ears.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is the rejection of secular liberal materialism and a return to the Christian foundations of the West.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is a healthy suspicion of credentialism and a return to human judgment.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>The Vibe Shift, in other words, is the return to believing your own experience and intuition instead of delegating truth to the experts.</strong></p><p><span>I think looking back, we‚Äôll see that this year was the beginning of the Downfall of Dogma, or what </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/04a28121-9592-4af4-8f7f-0e70015c5d69?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Iain McGilchrist</a><span>, whose gold-plated academic credentials include Oxford and Johns Hopkins, would call ‚ÄúLeft-Brained Thinking.‚Äù In a 2023 interview with UnHerd, </span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>I happen to believe our science is not scientific enough. It‚Äôs too dogmatic. I happen to believe our reason is not reasonable enough, it‚Äôs too dogmatic ‚Äî and it‚Äôs dogma that‚Äôs always the problem. </span><strong>We need science, we need reason, but we also need to see that they can‚Äôt answer all our questions.
