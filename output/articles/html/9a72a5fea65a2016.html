Emerging audiences from these communities want to see themselves on screen. Too often, however, they are either absent or presented in reductive, sometimes offensive ways.</span><br>        </p><br>    </div><br>  <br>                  </p><p>    <div><br>        <p><br>          <span>Yet McKinsey found a clear and consistent link between “above the line” talent—the cast, directors, and producers drive the creative aspects of a project—and whether diverse ideas, perspectives, stories and voices actually show up in media.</span><br>        </p><br>    </div><br>  <br>                  </p><p>    <div><br>        <p><br>          <span>In other words, if the people in front of and behind the camera look like all of us, the story will be about all of us, and it will be a story in which we all see ourselves. And we’ll pay to see it.</span><br>        </p><br>    </div><br>  <br>                  </p><p>    <div><br>        <p><br>          <span>At Doris Duke Foundation, our focus on media has been elevating the voices and perspectives of U.S. Muslims.</span><br>        </p><br>    </div><br>  <br>                  </p><p>    <div><br>        <p><br>          <span>During her life, Doris Duke was a devoted patron of the performing arts and of the artistic traditions of Muslim cultures from around the world.
