This butterflied roast chicken, marinated in a mixture of buttermilk, tarragon, Dijon mustard, and nutmeg (among other herbs), tastes better the longer it sits and soaks in the simple mixture—so if you set aside 10 minutes to prepare it on Sunday, it will be perfect mid-week. Come Wednesday, all you have to do is throw it on the stove for 5 minutes, then into the oven for 30 minutes; the butterflied cut helps it cook that much faster. And since the recipe only takes 1/4 cup of wine, you'll have plenty to sip on while you kick off your shoes and raise a glass to a roast chicken that's as easy as Sunday morning.
