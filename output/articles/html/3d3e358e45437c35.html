Pay no mind to this wee little bird.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The UCC had a whole smörgåsbord of DIP issues, some typical UCC stuff (waivers, pre-petition debt roll-ups, challenge period of liens, *yawn*), others less so (the budget’s failure to fully pay 503(b)(9) claims).**** Landlords, however, had a narrower complaint: “</span><em>… [the budget] did not provide any assurance that Stub Rent would be paid…,</em><span>” which, of course, the UCC b*tched about too.***** For those not in the know, stub rent is one of those damn pesky administrative expenses that have to be paid in full to confirm any BK plan. But the debtors were able to quell those concerns and squeak through the final DIP hearing by revising the final order to provide “</span><em>funding</em><span>” for stub rent payments and giving the debtors “</span><em>… authority, but not direction, to draw upon any ABL DIP Availability to provide for such funding[.]</em><span>” That language is going to come back to bite folks in the a$$, but, whatever, aside from a few dead canaries, nothing seemed amiss, and the court entered the final DIP order on October 22, 2024.</span></p><p><span>A couple of days later, and after some delay and a modification or two,****** the court also approved the debtors’ bidding procedures on October 25, 2024, officially blessing Nexus’s asset purchase agreement (the “Nexus APA”) to serve as the stalking horse bid and sending the debtors off … on a short dash? Whatever it was, it wasn’t a race. Under the procedures, bids were due October 28, which … *give us a moment, need to pull out a calendar* was a whopping three days later, two of which were the weekend. Uhhh, what? No doubt you’ll be flabbergasted to learn that not a single person submitted a qualified bid, although </span><strong>Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC</strong><span> (“GBRP”),******* the debtors’ store closing consultant, did drop an unqualified one on the debtors. Beyond its consultant hat, GBRP just happens be to an affiliate of </span><strong>1903P Loan Agent, LLC</strong><span> (“1903 Agent”) and </span><strong>1903 Partners, LLC </strong><span>(together with 1903 Agent, the “1903 Parties”), the former of which is the debtors’ pre-petition and DIP term loan agent and both of which are lenders under those facilities and own a majority of that debt.******** So safe to say that bid was submitted solely out of GBRP’s own interest in the debtors’ assets, had nothing to do with salvaging the term loan if the Nexus deal ran into a wall (spoiler alert: it did), and these dynamics presented no conflict of interest whatsoever for anyone,🙄. Christ. Weeks later, the court approved the Nexus sale on November 22.********* During the hearings, the debtors stressed:</span></p><pre><code><code>“...it was imperative to swiftly close the Nexus Sale to avoid business deterioration resulting from a prolonged stay in bankruptcy and weakening confidence from the Debtors’ commercial counterparties regarding the Debtors’ financial capacity to continue operating as a going-concern.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Well, that didn’t happen, and </span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5325af14-8090-4768-931e-b4f796b56711?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">Norfolk Southern</a></strong><span> now celebrates no longer having title to the most recent, Ohio-based train wreck. Here’s the debtors’ post-mortem:</span></p><pre><code><code>“Despite the Herculean efforts to prepare the estates for the sale transaction, on December 1, 2024, Nexus informed the Debtors that it would need more time to close and identified a new target closing of December 10 or 11, 2024—which dates would still permit the Debtors to satisfy the sale closing milestone of December 13, 2024 contemplated by the Debtors’ DIP Facilities … However, on December 5, 2024, the Debtors received a letter from Nexus notifying the Debtors that the minimum asset value closing condition set forth in … the Nexus APA would not be satisfied … [and] caution[ing] that ‘there [was] a significant capital need’ in order to close the Nexus Sale … The Debtors’ advisors were subsequently informed by Nexus’s advisors that this ‘significant capital need’ was approximately $75 million.” (emphasis added).</code></code></pre><p><em><strong>SEVENTY-FIVE. MILLION. DOLLARS!</strong><span> </span></em><span>Put another way, the debtors only needed roundabouts </span><em>214%</em><span> of the new money DIP to get to a close. Smoke starting to billow up, it was clearly time to contingency plan … or at least give some thought to what happens if the Nexus sale falls apart.</span></p><p><span>LOL, you wish. No, the business judgment rule yearns to be tested, and having 1,000% certainty that debtors’ counsel </span><strong>Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP</strong><span>’s (Brian Resnick, Adam Shpeen, Stephen Piraino, Ethan Stern) pre-filing decks included a baker’s dozen or more slides on that topic, this management team wasn’t going to simply let that value walk out the door.

Per the debtors: </p><pre><code><code>“…the DIP Lenders and their advisors were advising that the Debtors should seriously consider the parallel alternative path of commencing Store Closing Sales at all of the Debtors’ stores.”</code></code></pre><p><span>A week passed, and things found new ways to get worse. On December 14, (i) the DIP lenders sent the debtors a notice of DIP default because the sale still hadn’t closed, and (ii) Nexus informed the debtors “</span><em>…that closing the Nexus Sale prior to the Nexus APA Outside Date [of December 31] was very unlikely and that Nexus did not see a realistic path to doing so.</em><span>” At long last, the debtors awoke from their slumber. After a quick cup of coffee and a morning constitutional, they realized that the lenders had been right all along and gifted their employees a holiday treat.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5b2c412b-7292-4249-91f9-bd1014ba1c37?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54107e76-655c-4d76-98b4-d9aa4651ae93_400x300.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Source: quickmeme</figcaption></figure></div><p>That’s right, the debtors decided to light the business on fire and pivoted to an all-store closing process. </p><p><span>While they were getting busy ruining the holidays for, and lives of, their ~27,700 employees, GBRP had saddled up with a counterparty, </span><strong>Variety Wholesalers</strong><span> (“Variety”), and came back ‘round with a revised bid on December 15, which was based on the Nexus APA and contemplated (i) payment in full of the DIP (which, of course it did, because a good piece of it was held by GBRP’s buds, the 1903 Parties, and maximizing return on the term loan was mission critical), (ii) the preservation by Variety of at least 200 stores and upwards of 400 and, on top of that, a distribution center or two, (iii) the </span><em>potential </em><span>— Variety ain’t in the promise-making business — of continued employment for “</span><em>thousands</em><span>” of fortunate souls, (iv) the payment of “</span><em>anticipated</em><span>”</span><em> </em><span>go-forward administrative expenses, and (v) the payment of stub rent and some other administrative expenses, which would be funded by the proceeds of </span><em>tens of millions of dollars</em><span> worth of postpetition goods delivered by vendors who continued to support the debtors. </span><em>Bet you like that, don’tcha, vendors!</em><span> All in, a sh*t sandwich compared to the Nexus deal, but we reckon the debtors thought it made for better PR than sending every single employee to the breadline. But the i’s hadn’t been dotted nor the t’s crossed, so they still had some wood to chop.</span></p><p>Right around the time the debtors received GBRP’s bid, (i) landlords took note that deposits for September stub rent were still curiously missing from their bank accounts and asked the court to hold a status conference, and (ii) the UCC filed a motion to compel payment of that stub rent and 503(b)(9) claims or, alternatively, convert the cases to chapter 7s.</p><p><span>Keenly interested in learning more about this burning trash heap, the court teed them up for a December 19, 2024 hearing. What did the debtors tell us at that hearing? Nothing we couldn’t have guessed. The cases were a total f*cking disaster, no one was happy — in fact, most were quite pissed off, the debtors had no budget or clear path forward, stub rent hadn’t been paid (remember that language ⬆️ that resolved the DIP? The debtors took the position that “</span><em>funding</em><span>” and “</span><em>authority, but not direction</em><span>” meant f*ck-all, nothing required actual payment), administrative expenses were growing on the daily (on which, the court remarked, “</span><em>…I do appreciate, you know, the landlords are taking a big risk here and so are the other administrative creditors, including professionals, in this case.</em><span>”), and GUCs were — how do we put this delicately? — ABSOLUTELY F*CKED.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e147b227-01f0-4626-a67d-11991ae3bd0c?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_504,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa44f401e-44e5-4859-80cc-7680513caa46_1485x1047.png"></a><figcaption>Source: PETITION Meme Department. BIG fires. LOTS of damage.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the end, all that really came out of it was the court’s blessing to close all of the debtors’ stores, the scheduling of a follow-up status conference on December 30, 2024, the debtors’ agreement to submit a to-be-agreed cash collateral budget and not to place new orders with vendors, and the UCC’s punting of its motion to compel to a date TBD.</p><p><span>Fast forward to Friday, December 27, 2024, and the debtors worked out their deal with GBRP (who entered into a side deal with Variety for the stores and distribution center) and, as if the cases weren’t already enough of a clown show, filed a motion to approve it at the Monday, December 30 hearing – another three-day period spanning the weekend (anyone noticing a pattern here?), this time smack dab in the middle of the holidays.********** That finalized deal includes all of the details outlined ⬆️ and a special bonus. Remember how 11 days prior, the court made a remark about the big risk “</span><em>administrative creditors, including professionals</em><span>,” were taking? Well, the estate professionals put their heads together and came up with an articulate response.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/aef69c22-e3b7-432c-ac68-7bdf1e65be09?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_466,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbcba3b5-1dcb-489e-b995-91c018839a9f_466x260.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY. “Nah, we’ll take full payment,” said the law firm generating $6.2mm in profits per partner.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>LOL, expecting those holding the pen to take an L? C’mon now, y’all know better than that! Small vendors and landlords are much better situated to take it on the chin. Anyway, the court obliged the debtors, and everyone got together again on December 30, 2024, and got together they did, both that day and the next. Not to be outdone by </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e0d6bba1-275d-4b74-8cb4-2521632d5f0a?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">Franchise Group, Inc.</a><span>, these hearings were looooooooooooooooooooooong as f*ck. Over TEN HOURS of our lives were sucked away, and we’re never getting them back. And unlike Franchise Group’s, they weren’t even that entertaining! We’d consider filing an admin claim for the suffering we endured, but with the recovery non-professional admin creditors are gonna get, and tossing in two bucks of our own, we’d be able to buy a sh*tty cup of gas station coffee.</span></p><p>At the hearing, every admin creditor about to get boned and the US trustee (the “UST”) had thoughts on notice — as in, there wasn’t any. When that issue and related discovery concerns were raised by a vendor, Davis Polk actually had the balls to say this out loud:</p><pre><code><code>“[F]or parties who wish to serve discovery, you know, they were certainly able to in advance of the hearing today.”</code></code></pre><p>What? When? You filed a motion on a Friday for hearing on Monday. This sh*t can only be said in bankruptcy court — any other court would laugh these jokers right out of the room. We’ll spare you a few details, but Judge Stickles concluded that some business-day discovery was warranted and kicked everything out … by one day, giving creditors and the UST the option of deposing the debtors’ witness that evening or early the next morning and otherwise preparing for trial. After what was assuredly a relaxing, sleep-filled night, everyone got back together the next morning. Picking up where they left off, the debtors made a handful of points: (i) the GBRP-Variety deal was the best deal the debtors were going to get, (ii) the UCC supported it, (iii) liquidating was a straight-up worse alternative, and (iv) the payment of professionals was no biggie because the DIP’s carve-out and escrow funding already took care of them (again, must be nice to have that pen in hand, and certainly not one of the reasons the UCC supported the deal).</p><p>The UST and vendors made their arguments too: the deal needed additional funding for administrative expenses, including the payment of UST fees (which will screech to a halt the week of January 25, 2025), the hearing should be kicked out, or the cases converted to 7 because the debtors shouldn’t be allowed to pick and choose which admin creditors get paid. But it’s bankruptcy court, and while Delaware’s admittedly less egregious than other venues, debtors generally get away with waving their arms while screaming the sky is falling. The court approved the sale, of course, and it closed on January 3, 2025.</p><p>Since then, creditors have carpet bombed the debtors’ docket with requests for payment of their administrative expenses. We’re not kidding — over 50 motions have been filed so far, asserting millions and millions of dollars worth of claims, and the figure keeps growing.*********** Topping off this sh*t sundae, Nexus dropped a couple juicy cherries in the form of two motions: one to compel the debtors to repay Nexus for its expenses and return its $2.5mm deposit and another to compel the debtors to pay Nexus its $7.5mm break-up fee after the GBRP sale closed, all as required under the Nexus APA.</p><p>This thing is going to convert to 7, there’s no way around it. Taking one landlord at his word, the magnitude of administrative expenses is pushing upwards of $300mm, all accrued within three and a half months. The next hearing is slated for January 21, 2025, and we’ll keep you posted as this mound of refuse burns out.</p><p>Best of luck to all vendors, landlords, and everyone else left holding the bag. Doubtless, the estates’ lawyers, bankers, and financial advisors are sending thoughts and prayers.</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6a619af5-25f3-412e-adcb-01aa96ed755f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2495b21-e3e0-44c1-95fb-0d0e0f32f284_400x231.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><h5><span>* We specify “post-filing” because we saw this train wreck coming from a mile away.

Like stub rent, they’re entitled to administrative priority. If any of this is new-to-you info, we’ll suggest perusing 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(9).</h5><h5>***** “Stub rent” is the portion of rent allocable to the period between the petition date and the next date a rent payment is due under the lease.</h5><h5>****** Judge Stickles – ever the stickler – sustained the US trustee’s objection to the proposed “superpriority” status of Nexus’ bid protections because, you know, there’s literally no authority or support for that in the Bankruptcy Code. Nexus and the debtors lived with it because, like, what else were they gonna do about it?</h5><h5><span>******* GBRP is represented by </span><strong>Riemer &amp; Braunstein LLP</strong><span> (Steven Fox) and </span><strong>Ashby &amp; Geddes, P.A.</strong><span> (Gregory Taylor) as legal counsel.</span></h5><h5><span>******** 1903 Agent is represented by </span><strong>Otterbourg, P.C.</strong><span> (Chad Simon, James Drew) and </span><strong>Richards, Layton &amp; Finger, P.A.</strong><span> (Mark Collins, John Knight, Zachary Javorsky) as legal counsel. Given the affiliations of GBRP and 1903 Agent and how this disaster played out, we’ll go ahead and assume Riemer and Otterbourg have been “coordinating” directly or through individuals at Gordon Brothers who don a few different hats.</span></h5><h5>********* The court held two days of hearings stretching over six hours regarding the sale of D&amp;O claims to Nexus and a couple requests to extend the challenge period under the DIP. To make short shrift of it, the court excised the claims of non-go-forward D&amp;Os but allowed the rest to be sold, which Nexus was good with, and denied the requests.</h5><h5>********** During the interlude, Nexus exited stage left by delivering a coup de grâce letter to the debtors on December 21 that put the Nexus APA out of its misery.</h5><h5>***********We were somewhat amused to see that chapter 11 bankruptcy alum Thrasio LLC is among them. It appears that the great online Amazon killer and trinket aggregator actually uses Big Lots as an aftermarket reseller, lol. </h5><h3>💥JOANNsin’ for Another BIG Mess?💥</h3><p>Recently, an Ohio-based brick-and-mortar retailer with hundreds of locations and north of half a billion dollars of funded debt filed chapter 11 cases in the District of Delaware looking to pursue a transaction with an at-hand stalking horse supported by a prepetition agent and lender on a truncated timeline. </p><p>Sensing déjà vu?</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ebbb32e2-02eb-46c5-a5a7-20f8011388ae?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_550,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea9ec936-017f-4ce7-8de9-66e9dee1de91_640x258.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: Tenor.
