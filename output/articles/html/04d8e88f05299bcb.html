            <p>Many sheet pan chicken recipes are deceptively alluring.

But when drawn in by this promise, I’m usually let down. Sometimes the chicken is done way before the vegetables (or vice versa), the ingredients steam instead of brown, or the whole deal takes a lot more time in the oven than advertised.

Thanks to the rocket-hot sheet pan, this is one of the speediest sheet pan chicken dinners I’ve made. The high heat not only benefits the chicken but the broccoli, chickpeas, and sun-dried tomatoes, too (the little bits of crispy-chewy, almost burnt sun-dried tomatoes are absolutely addictive). Set a timer twice when making this dinner—the first time to remind yourself to flip the chicken, and the second time to check its doneness—so there are no surprises, or burnt dinner!

This may not be a set-it-and-forget-about type of dinner, but it’s simple to make and can be on the table in less than an hour. With a little attention to detail (and a few smart tricks), all of us can consistently prepare a better sheet pan chicken dinner. And with results this good, the laundry can always wait until tomorrow.
