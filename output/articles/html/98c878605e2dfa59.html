If having an architectural firm that listens to your needs, understands that real people have real budget constraints, and that has sensitivity to and an understanding of the practicalities of getting things built in the real world—while also creating innovative, breathtaking designs—you will not be disappointed in Modulus.

It's kind of weird reading Yelp reviews of architects. Can you imagine if they had them for industrial designers?</blockquote>
