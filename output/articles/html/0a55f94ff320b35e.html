But it was slow going, with each transaction requiring customized assistance.</p><p>Then she came across an <a href="https://irpages2.eqs.com/download/companies/kkrinc/Presentations/KKR_Teach-In_November_2019.pdf">investor presentation</a> from a different universe: KKR, one of the world’s largest private equity firms. In it, a KKR executive, Pete Stavros, discussed a model he had been developing to provide employees with an equity stake in companies it purchased, so the workers would reap some benefits if it was flipped for a profit. When all goes according to plan, KKR doesn’t give up a penny of profit, since newly motivated workers benefit the company’s bottom line, elevating the eventual sale price by more than what KKR gives up.</p><p>In 2021, the two met up to talk about the idea. By that time, Mr. Stavros had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-executives-push-to-spread-employee-stock-ownership-begins-to-gain-traction-11613730601">decided to start</a> an organization to promote his model more broadly, hoping to reach the 12 million people who work for companies that private equity firms own. Ms. Miller saw it as a way to move much faster.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Me, as Anna-Lisa working at Project Equity — zero ability to influence private equity in any way — I thought, ‘Oh, gosh, maybe this could be a really efficient scale lever,’” Ms. Miller said. “And here’s Pete, not only doing it but wanting to start this nonprofit.”</p><p>A few months later, she was the founding executive director of the new group, Ownership Works. The organization now has 25 employees working in a sleek New York office space a couple of blocks from KKR’s soaring headquarters at Hudson Yards. A couple of dozen private equity firms have signed on to give the idea a try.</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.</p><p>Already a subscriber? <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?response_type=cookie&amp;client_id=vi&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F01%2F28%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fkkr-private-equity-employee-ownership.html&amp;asset=opttrunc">Log in</a>.</p><p>Want all of The Times? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=89WYR&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F01%2F28%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fkkr-private-equity-employee-ownership.html">Subscribe</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article></p></div>
