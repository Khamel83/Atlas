        <blockquote>Here’s a friendly reminder for y’all!  Don’t forget that the Southwest Companion Pass will soon be harder to earn.

On October 4, 2017, the limited-time increased sign-up bonuses on the Chase Southwest Plus and Chase Southwest Premier cards are ending.  So if you’re thinking about applying, you should do it soon!

You have 1 week left to apply for the Chase Southwest Plus or Chase Southwest Premier before their increased 60,000 point welcome offers end.  That’s important to note, because without the increased bonuses, it will be harder to earn the Southwest Companion Pass!

By earning 60,000 bonus points from 1 personal and 1 small business Southwest card, you’ll have more than the 110,000 Southwest points required in a calendar year to earn the Southwest Companion Pass.

Emily and I consider the Southwest Companion Pass to be the best deal in travel!  That’s because it allows you to bring a friend or family member with you for (nearly) free on any paid and award Southwest tickets for up to 2 years!

Note:   To get a full 2 years of use from your Companion Pass, timing is very important.  The Companion Pass is good through the calendar year you earn the points, as well as the following calendar year.  So if you earn the Companion Pass today, it will be good through December 31, 2018.

If you apply for the cards now, and wait to complete your minimum spending after your December 2017 statement closes, your points will post in January 2018.  So your Companion Pass will be good until December 31, 2019 (nearly 2 full years!).

Here’s a post about timing your spending to earn the Companion Pass in 2017 or 2018.

Bottom Line

The increased 60,000 Southwest point offers for both Chase Southwest personal credit cards will end next week, on October 4, 2017.

By opening 2 cards, you’ll earn more than enough Southwest points to qualify for the Southwest Companion Pass.  It’s the best deal in travel!

But be sure to time the minimum spending correctly to make the most of this deal!</blockquote>
