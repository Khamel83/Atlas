Just an extremely solid week over here at Optimism HQ. Google did what it does best: use its monopoly search profits to fund breakthroughs in other technological fields. OpenAI did what it does best: ship a ton of high-quality product quickly. Caltech did what is does best: put out important research. And Trump did what he does best: share out provocative policy statements on the internet that, behind the ALL CAPS, actually makes a fair bit of sense.</span></p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it.</p><p><strong>(1) Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip</strong></p><p><em>From Google Quantum AI</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Today I‚Äôm delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip. Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics, enabling two major achievements.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>The first is that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits.

The company‚Äôs latest chip quantum chip, Willow, represents a major leap forward in the field of quantum computing. And, if we crack quantum computing‚Ä¶basically any problem that can be solved, will be solved. Cryptography. Materials science. Drug discovery. Point a quantum computer at these extremely complex topics, and a question that would take previous generations of supercomputers extremely (extremely) long periods of time to answer, can be in answered almost instantly. </p><p>There were three big takeaways from Google‚Äôs announcement of Willow.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong><span> Willow effectively reduces error rates as the number of qubits increases, overcoming a major hurdle in quantum computing and paving the way for practical, large-scale quantum machines.</span></p><p><strong>(2)</strong><span> Willow, can perform in under five minutes computations that would take today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, showcasing unprecedented processing power.</span></p><p><strong>(3)</strong><span> The founder of Google Quantum AI, Hartmut Neven, wrote that that Willow‚Äôs performance was so powerful that it ‚Äúhad to have 'borrowed' the computation from parallel universes.‚Äù The chip is so powerful that it implies the existence of the multiverse.</span></p><p>By the way, this is Hartmut Neven‚Ä¶ </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/fa381c30-ca6a-49cd-a810-3c8bfbc530e8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61770993-4a4e-4e70-8a9e-e350fe9b9e67_2228x1255.png"></a></figure></div><p><span>We‚Äôre not technical enough to understand whether Willow is </span><em>the </em><span>breakthrough that unlocks quantum, but we‚Äôre practiced enough vibe readers to suspect that this is the dude who‚Äôs going to make it happen. </span></p><p>We‚Äôre extremely excited to watch this space as quantum computing moves out of the lab and into practical real-world use cases. The Google team (and a number of other players) seem to be clipping off milestones at a quicker and quicker pace here, so we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if quantum arrives to our sliver of the multiverse soon.</p><p><em>From OpenAI</em></p><p>It‚Äôs the most wonderful time of the year.

The release marks a significant step forward in the development of agentic AI, systems that can think, plan, and take action on behalf of users. Gemini 2.0 can understand context, generate creative text formats, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions informatively. The model is expected to power many of Google‚Äôs products, from search to Bard.</p><p><span>The coolest, most novel product, which we don‚Äôt have access to yet but can‚Äôt wait to try, is </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6a1e4555-56f5-40b1-b650-7142ffdf63df?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Deep Research</a><span>, which makes research reports for any subject you wish by taking its time, checking a lot of sources, and pulling the results into something cohesive. </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/467aa288-5d44-4e68-a252-32ba2ba8be47?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2408,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c96389-2131-4555-bdbb-3c7e4fc2b99c_1204x676.png"></a></figure></div><p>Based on replies and commentary on X, it seems like Deep Research is about as good as hiring a good college student to do research ‚Äî unlikely to change the trajectory of your project, but a useful timesaver. </p><p>More generally, it‚Äôs just really, really cool to watch this AI arms race in real time. Every week there is some big, splashy advancement that pulls forward innovation across the industry. OpenAI launches new product? Cool. The next week Google launches a similar product, but faster. The next week Meta launches an open sourced version of that product. The following week Anthropic launches a more thoughtful version of the product. And then finally OpenAI (or any of the players) just totally start the cycle again with another big release. What‚Äôs happening in AI is the most legible, public display of innovation I‚Äôve ever seen in my lifetime. That‚Äôs not only good for AI development, but I‚Äôm guessing it also pulls forward innovation in other industries ‚Äî AI is just setting the example that you can move industries forward both thoughtfully and quickly. </p><p><strong>(4)</strong><span> </span><strong>Trump Permitting Reforms</strong></p><p><em>From Donald J. Trump on Truth Social</em></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/7171f928-2006-4c28-ba3a-bb1700c27dd3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad15026f-2efa-4295-ba4d-dc818b980da7_2154x1246.png"></a></figure></div><p>Speaking of watching things get built fast‚Ä¶ </p><p>Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump ‚ÄúTruthed‚Äù his plans to expedite federal permits for $1 billion-plus investments in energy and infrastructure projects, including environmental approvals. That this policy comes from a former real estate developer, a class of entrepreneur that is particularly weary of permitting regulations and environmental approvals, is not exactly surprising. But in Trump‚Äôs America, IT‚ÄôS TIME TO BUILD, and a policy like this could accelerate large-scale infrastructure and energy projects and attract substantial domestic and foreign investments.</p><p>To be clear, some people really don‚Äôt like this plan. They argue this violates NEPA and prioritizes corporate interests over community and environmental impacts. The critics are not exactly wrong ‚Äî the plan not only likely violates NEPA, but is an outward challenge of it. Whether or not that‚Äôs a bad thing, I guess depends on your perspective on NEPA. We‚Äôll see if and how the plan is actually implemented over the coming months. There‚Äôs going to be an interesting balance between regulatory oversight and economic growth over the next four years, but who doesn‚Äôt like some good ol‚Äô fashioned common sense permitting reform?</p><p><em>From Caltech</em></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/401b7edc-d906-458f-82c3-e3cac29e9ffb?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/Pafe793c1H4"></a><p>Wham! Bam! Thank you, Ma‚Äôam!</p><p>Caltech researchers developed bioresorbable acoustic microrobots (BAMs)‚Äîtiny, hydrogel-based spheres capable of delivering drugs directly to targeted areas within the body. These microrobots can navigate bodily fluids, be directed precisely via external magnetic fields, and release their therapeutic payloads upon reaching specific sites. </p><p>The precise and targeted drug delivery, combined with the fact that the BAMs can safely degrade after use, should reduce side effects and improve treatment effectiveness for various diseases. And the early results are promising: in mouse studies, BAMs effectively reduced bladder tumor sizes. Targeted, precise, safe and effective drug delivery? Yeah, I‚Äôll take that!</p><p>Packy here with a quick ask. We‚Äôre two weeks in to Boring News and having a blast. We added follow-ups on previous stories like Fed cuts, Mangione‚Äôs Manifesto, and TIME Person of the year. We‚Äôll keep working to improve it.
