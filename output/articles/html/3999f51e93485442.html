        <blockquote>If you are looking for some new reading material, let me direct you to this list of the Top 100 Economics Blogs of 2016. Its a broad and deep list, with both MSM and traditional bloggers present.

Many of my favorites are here: Calculated Risk (#20), Real Time Economics (#2), fivethirtyeight (#5), Bloomberg View (#6), Liberty Street Economics (#8), Mark Thoma Economist’s View (#22) and of course, Krugman (#1) topped the list.

The Big Picture comes in at #19, which given the rest of the field, and how often we write about non-economic issues, is deeply satisfying.

From Mises (#9) to Piketty (#4), this crosses all manner of schools and ideologies. Anyone wanting to review a broad cross section of varied economic thought should check out the list.
