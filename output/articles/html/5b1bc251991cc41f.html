        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Car interiors contain everything from plastic, metal and glass to leather, fabric and rubber. Cleaning and disinfecting them requires different approaches.

Learning these techniques can be helpful for disinfecting not just your car, but a variety of items that you carry in and out of your house. In the video below, car detailing expert Larry Kosilla of Ammo Auto Care shows you how he disinfects--not just cleans nor sanitizes, but disinfects--the multi-material interior of a car. (He also explains the difference between those three terms.)

You might think "What does a car detailer know about germs?" While he points out he isn't a medical expert, the chemistry-savvy Kosilla has carefully gone through the EPA, WHO and CDC recommendations, and taken pains to spot helpful information buried in the label copy that you or I might have missed. (As one example: One product requires being left on a surface and visibly wet for just 15 seconds to sanitize--but a full three minutes to disinfect.)

And as a bonus, he demonstrates the proper way to remove germ-covered gloves without touching your exposed skin in the process. (Hint: You use different methods for the first and second gloves.)
