        <blockquote>Tucked away in the Redwood trees of Cazadero, California stands this unassuming A-frame cabin.

It appears tiny on the outside, but the interior tells a different tale.

While one of the original aims of A-frame construction is to easily shed snow—we've previously seen what can go wrong when too much heavy snow is allowed to accumulate on a roof—it's also an efficient configuration to build and live within. Less materials are consumed than with a traditional rectilinear shape, and inside there is less cubic volume to heat or cool.

By placing seating and waist-high appliances against the walls, one can use up the awkward wall-meets-floor space. The main portion of the space offers enough distance from the walls for even tall people to walk upright.

The apex of the triangle is the perfect spot to place the loft bed.

While the second story requires sacrificing the centermost portion of the ground floor footprint with a staircase...

...the owners have made good use of the belowstairs space for storage.

If I was going to join the Tiny House movement, I think I'd opt with an A-frame over the traditional shape.</blockquote>
