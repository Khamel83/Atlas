Sonnet 3.7; Dylan Patel had the <a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1894154230229078391?s=48">joke of the day</a> about Anthropic's seeming aversion to the number "4", which means "die" in Chinese:</p></p><p></p><p><div><div><a href="https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1894154230229078391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1894154230229078391%7Ctwgr%5E9b7c95fe5dfee3420348883f6ac0764291c2c7a9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fchrome-headless.local%3A9222%2Fatomic"><img

href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/a-new-generation-of-ais-claude-37">this post by Ethan Mollick</a> suggests that Anthropic did not increment the main version number because Sonnet 3.7 is still in the GPT-4 class of models as far as compute is concerned.</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>After publishing this piece, I was contacted by Anthropic who told me that Sonnet 3.7 would not be considered a 10^26 FLOP model and cost a few tens of millions of dollars to train, though future models will be much bigger. I updated the post with that information. The only significant change is that Claude 3 is now referred to as an advanced model but not a Gen3 model.</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>I love Mollick's work, but reject his neutral naming scheme: whoever gets to a generation first deserves the honor of the name. In other words, if Gen2 models are GPT-4 class, then Gen3 models are Grok 3 class.</p></p><p></p><p><p>And, whereas Sonnet 3.7 is an evolution of Sonnet 3.5's fascinating mixture of personality and coding prowess, likely a result of some Anthropic special sauce in post-training, Grok 3 <em>feels</em> like a model that is the result of a step-order increase in compute capacity, with a much lighter layer of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Its answers are far more in-depth and detailed (model good!), but frequently becomes too verbose (RLHF lacking); it gets math problems right (model good!), but its explanations are harder to follow (RLHF lacking). It is also much more willing to generate forbidden content, from erotica to bomb recipes, while having on the surface the political sensibilities of Tumblr, with something more akin to 4chan under the surface if you prod. ((This suggests a surprising takeaway: it's possible that while RLHF on ChatGPT and especially Claude block off the 4chan elements, they also tamp down the Tumblr elements, which is to say the politics don't come from the post-training, but from the dataset — i.e. the Internet. In other words, if I'm right about Grok 3 having a much lighter layer of RLHF, then that explains both the surface politics, and what is available under the surface.)) Grok 3, more than any model yet, feels like the distilled Internet; it's my favorite so far.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Grok 3 is also a reminder of how much speed matters, and, by extension, why base models are still important in a world of AI's that reason. Grok 3 is tangibly faster than the competition, which is a better user experience; more generally, conversation is the realm of quick wits, not deep thinkers.

This model worked even better with software, which was perfectly replicable.</p></p><p></p><p><p>That history starts in 1956, when William Shockley founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to commercialize the transistor that he had helped invent at Bell Labs; he chose Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother. A year later the so-called “Traitorous Eight”, led by Robert Noyce, left and founded Fairchild Semiconductor down the road. Six years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened a facility in Hong Kong to assemble and test semiconductors. Assembly required manually attaching wires to a semiconductor chip, a labor-intensive and monotonous task that was difficult to do economically with American wages, which ran about $2.50/hour; Hong Kong wages were a tenth of that. Four years later Texas Instruments opened a facility in Taiwan, where wages were $0.19/hour; two years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened another facility in Singapore, where wages were $0.11/hour.</p></p><p></p><p><p>In other words, you can make the case that the classic story of Silicon Valley isn’t completely honest. Chips did have marginal costs, but that marginal cost was, within single digit years of the founding of Silicon Valley, exported to Asia.</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>I recounted in that Article about how this outsourcing was an intentional policy of the U.S. government, and launched into a broader discussion about the post-War Pax Americana global order that placed the U.S. consumer market at the center of global trade, denominated by the dollar, and why that led to an inevitable decline in American manufacturing and the rise of a country in China that, in retrospect, was simply too big, and thus too expensive, for America to bear.</p></p><p></p><p><p>That, anyways, is how one might frame many of the signals coming out of the 2nd Trump administration, including what appears to be a Monroe 2.0 Doctrine approach to North America, an attempt to extricate the U.S. from the Ukraine conflict specifically and Europe broadly, and, well, a perhaps tamer approach to China to start, at least compared to Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail.</p></p><p></p><p><p>One possibility is that Trump is actually following through on the "pivot to Asia" that U.S. Presidents have been talking about but failing to execute on for years; in this view the U.S. is girding itself up to defend Taiwan and other entities in Asia, and hopefully break up the burgeoning China-Russia relationship in the process.</p></p><p></p><p><p>The other explanation is more depressing, but perhaps more realistic: President Trump may believe that the unipolar U.S.-dominated world that has been the norm since the fall of the Soviet Union is drawing to a close, and it's better for the U.S. to proactively shift to a new norm than to have it forced upon them.</p></p><p></p><p><p>The important takeaway that is relevant to this Article is that Taiwan is the flashpoint in both scenarios. A pivot to Asia is about gearing up to defend Taiwan from a potential Chinese invasion or embargo; a retrenchment to the Americas is about potentially granting — or acknowledging — China as the hegemon of Asia, which would inevitably lead to Taiwan's envelopment by China.</p></p><p></p><p><p>This is, needless to say, a discussion where I tread gingerly, not least because I have lived in Taipei off and on for over two decades. And, of course, there is the moral component entailed in Taiwan being a vibrant democracy with a population that has no interest in reunification with China. To that end, the status quo has been simultaneously absurd and yet surprisingly sustainable: Taiwan is an independent country in nearly every respect, with its own border, military, currency, passports, and — pertinent to tech — economy, increasingly dominated by TSMC; at the same time, Taiwan has not declared independence, and the official position of the United States is to acknowledge that China believes Taiwan is theirs, without endorsing either that position or Taiwanese independence.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Chinese and Taiwanese do, in my experience, handle this sort of ambiguity much more easily than do Americans; still, gray zones only go so far. What has been just as important are realist factors like military strength (once in favor of Taiwan, now decidedly in favor of China), economic ties (extremely deep between Taiwan and China, and China and the U.S.), and war-waging credibility. Here the Ukraine conflict and the resultant China-Russia relationship looms large, thanks to the sharing of military technology and overland supply chains for oil and food that have resulted, even as the U.S. has depleted itself. That, by extension, gets at another changing factor: the hollowing out of American manufacturing under Pax Americana has been directly correlated with China's dominance of the business of making things, the most essential war-fighting capability.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Still, there is — or rather was — a critical factor that might give China pause: the importance of TSMC. Chips undergird every aspect of the modern economy; the rise of AI, and the promise of the massive gains that might result, only make this need even more pressing. And, as long as China needs TSMC chips, they have a powerful incentive to leave Taiwan alone.</p></p><p></p><p><h3>Trump, Taiwan, and TSMC</h3></p><p></p><p><p>Anyone who has been following the news for the last few years, however, can surely see the problem: the various iterations of the chip ban, going back to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-zte-ban-techs-trade-war-risk-chinas-delayed-approval-and-apples-pain/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.aQT4UpXoL3FCeznezQk5AE9WTFFrQpw0PRDf6Vo-SqPySgiwWhXMrd8gqvYpPwrkeKbJyyRpoKvQ-DDtKII_TF40V_dj-0Q_Gu28_eA36CUHlK3YZ3d4X8VHZ2NHnn7V-RxFuAAh6poS4NH5QE1nK6iGknDjeXGeTygDXySyv_wECjjR_oh7IVAP5BbftY-JTFwL156NGWj1j57huNmLXPiw6UOpZH9es5vVcMpGRxyQbwC40gZo8s1t0JVNX72JcSIUusF8VLP1mqwlt9VXRp8rr-rYBT9onmMiXRv8ROHTr4L46YgTSgCwJ_UfpnNsnlS0X6k-cYlU6AsyL1xo1g">the initial action against ZTE in 2018</a>, have the perhaps-unintended effect of making China <em>less</em> dependent on TSMC.

To catch up will certainly take time, but if this action harms ZTE as much as it seems it will I suspect the commitment will be even more significant than it already is.</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>I added two years later, after President Trump barred Huawei from TSMC chips <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/taiwan-and-techs-geopolitical-realities-arm-on-mac-tsmcs-choice/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIwL3RhaXdhbi1hbmQtdGVjaHMtZ2VvcG9saXRpY2FsLXJlYWxpdGllcy1hcm0tb24tbWFjLXRzbWNzLWNob2ljZS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0MzA5NDk2MiwiaWF0IjoxNzQwNTAyOTYyLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.OEunvc9LyGrDSbZcj5cWA-V9K1InfuldDC7QN_wVt1K5RNcq-Af-_o2dXvwDbPcX5nQ8wab7bOBRTkj1EzjB1zlEiG9XFrPlAGuZO7joAowhkqjxchAI8ebboRL0h4ERptlRCEUW-KC7ZJ53mpoE2bjvGDu2YezTNz8CI1-SG-D_P-ROYB5ijhayzh2Xffjo467R_KUKAca3g8PvaacoMDIzTfULxKLmRKIB8IBekU5jpqj5EfmOmulBmfBcB7ZYHOlVaKxztKdtA0RSG2b4MlD00R4i_cU2Z-qHibvWWec8Qn62AgCDiWbYS0Z0ubkZShaLEJB-t_Cb-C0dBp8P7Q">in 2020</a>:</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>I am, needless to say, not going to get into the finer details of the relationship between China and Taiwan (and the United States, which plays a prominent role); it is less that reasonable people may disagree and more that expecting reasonableness is probably naive.

That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would be devastating…one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished.</p></p><p></p><p><br><p>Now you can see the fly in Goldilocks' porridge! China would certainly like the best chips from TSMC, but they are figuring out how to manage with SMIC and the Ascend and surprisingly efficient state-of-the-art models; the entire AI economy in the U.S., on the other hand — the one that is developing so nicely, with private funding pursuing the frontier, and competition and innovation up-and-down the stack — is completely dependent on TSMC and Taiwan.

It's simply not possible for one foundry to "take over" another: while the final output is the same — a microprocessor — nearly every step of the process is different in a multitude of ways. Transistors — even ones of the same class — can have different dimensions, with different layouts (TSMC, for example, packs its transistors more densely); production lines can be organized differently, to serve different approaches to lithography; chemicals are tuned to individual processes, and can't be shared; equipment is tailored to a specific line, and can't be switched out; materials can differ, throughout the chip, along with how exactly they are prepared and applied. Sure, most of the equipment could be repurposed, but one doesn't simply layer a TSMC process onto an Intel fab! The best you could hope for is that TSMC could rebuild the fabs using the existing equipment according to their specifications.</p></p><p></p><p><p>That, though, doesn't actually solve the Taiwan problem: TSMC is still headquartered in Taiwan, still has its R&amp;D division there, and is still beholden to a Taiwanese government directive to not export its most cutting edge processes (and yes, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/president-trump-take-two-big-tech-little-tech-chips-and-hardware-elon-musks-triumph/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.jjelbZpcR8xwF09LKoosAbMYRi4jOl2tRdVEdtIDMxOoHlpn2zRSJNx-oxrIYJq0thvRICs1xfJLeC90DcKwTidGBAAO_lvyPv1IyC79Xi_pHEMhODJ1wiqDITr5_-hdkQnXXiLmI3xZhtL8OJbC9NtqocsckQ6Gd5hCUnsUK-d8ThumxkWY_BSLrEFI3O2du088POQEvYXNU758_YO2q6g38EwcjUl7ql0Vuiz6cBrN-D7nI2MYVmGwugoeMbcrQN0GNacx3Tjx2cj7wqTm-ExgOM3iZIef3U2x9P7dbCjgPAjX3NfO0NOp0NRE840MOxnd7Sr_3eSRkk1BUNyk5A">there is truth</a> to Trump's complaints that Taiwan sees TSMC as leverage to guarantee that the U.S. defends Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion).

That lead is real, but Intel, for all of its struggles, is only a few years behind. That is a meaningful difference in terms of the processors used in smartphones, high performance computing, and AI, but the U.S. is still in the game.

That is a long-winded way to say that the following proposal includes several ideas that, in isolation, I find some combination of distasteful, against my principles, and even downright dangerous. So here goes.</p></p><p></p><p><h4>End the China Chip Ban</h4></p><p></p><p><p>The first thing the U.S. should do — and, by all means, make this a negotiating plank in a broader agreement with China — is let Chinese companies, including Huawei, make chips at TSMC, and further, let Chinese companies buy top-of-the-line Nvidia chips.</p></p><p></p><p><p>The Huawei one is straightforward: Huawei's founder <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-founder-told-xi-chinas-concerns-about-lack-chips-have-eased-state-media-2025-02-21/">may have told Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> that Huawei doesn't need external chip makers, but I think that the reality of having access to cutting edge TSMC fabrication would show that the company's revealed preference would be for better chips than Huawei can get from SMIC — and the delta is only going to grow. Sure, Huawei would still work with SMIC, but the volume would go down; critically, so would the urgency of having no other choice. This, by extension, would restart China's dependency on TSMC, thereby increasing the cost of making a move on Taiwan.</p></p><p></p><p><p>At the same time, giving Huawei access to cutting edge chips would be a significant threat to Nvidia's dominance; the reason the company is so up-in-arms about the chip ban isn't simply foregone revenue but <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-chips-and-china-geopolitical-considerations-nvidia-considerations/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.OQXF8gvClgCUYaRAzKCI_7_NJcTKRCtfEXriCxAGxvMlh5FBB4fukH0dNx9UCNI6RVtlaZwvQxnNP9sZNTvEKzz4Xvg-UORAJjDKycdKI8KlYNSCNTD5tRplKJjdIibQiqSE7VteUPPhQNggvAU39CGFQ1f6RonsT80iR9iI55AQyuVYmC_H8lMHwDpCrm3oOR7Oqs5ELy9BxD23ulqidBv2eOd6ME8x_ECBZDw22j9K3ih2kWGthEV5biO296FXIsEW3fXmABidqjYS7iajBQngudRuONA7inUoRA6nbfhrFiSLouaG4xFZTp683O2Fj2-y2WDWchojWx0xXTkCMg">the forced development of an alternative to their CUDA ecosystem</a>. The best way to neuter that challenge — and it is in the U.S.'s interest to have Nvidia in control, not Huawei — is to give companies like Bytedance, Alibaba, and DeepSeek the opportunity to buy the best.</p></p><p></p><p><p>This does, without question, unleash China in terms of AI; preventing that has been the entire point of the various flavors of chip bans that came down from the Biden administration. DeepSeek's success, however, should force a re-evaluation about just how viable it is to completely cut China off from AI.</p></p><p></p><p><p>It's also worth noting that success in stopping China's AI efforts has its own risks: another reason why China has held off from moving against Taiwan is the knowledge that every year they wait increases their relative advantages in all the real world realities I listed above; that makes it more prudent to wait. The prospect of the U.S. developing the sort of AI that matters in a military context, however, even as China is cut off, changes that calculus: now the prudent course is to move sooner rather than later, particularly if the U.S. is dependent on Taiwan for the chips that make that AI possible.</p></p><p></p><p><h4>Double Down on the Semiconductor Equipment Ban</h4></p><p></p><p><p>While I've continually made references to "chip bans", that's actually incomplete: the U.S. has also made moves to limit China's access to semiconductor equipment necessary for making leading edge chips (SMIC's 7nm process, for example, is almost completely dependent on western semiconductor equipment). Unfortunately, <a href="https://semianalysis.com/2024/10/28/fab-whack-a-mole-chinese-companies/">this effort has mostly been a failure</a>, thanks to generous loopholes that are downstream from China being a large market for U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers.</p></p><p></p><p><p>It's time for those loopholes to go away; remember, the overriding goal is for China to increase its dependence on Taiwan, and that means cutting SMIC and China's other foundries off at the knees. Yes, this increases the risk that China will develop its own alternatives to western semiconductor manufacturers, leading to long-term competition and diminished money for R&amp;D, but this is a time for hard choices and increasing Taiwan's importance to China is more important.</p></p><p></p><p><h4>Build Trailing Edge Fabs in the U.S.</h4></p><p></p><p><p>The U.S.'s dependency on TSMC for trailing edge chip capacity remains a massive problem; if you think the COVID chip shortages were bad, then a scenario where the U.S. is stuck with GlobalFoundries and no one else is a disaster so great it is hard to contemplate. However, as long as TSMC exists, there is zero economic rationale for anyone to build more trailing edge fabs.</p></p><p></p><p><p>This, then, is a textbook example of where government subsidies are the answer: there is a national security need for trailing edge capacity, and no economic incentive to build it. And, as an added bonus, this helps fill in some of the revenue for semiconductor manufacturers who are now fully cut off from China. TSMC takes a blow, of course, but they are also being buttressed by orders from Huawei and other Chinese chip makers.</p></p><p></p><p><h4>Intel and the Leading Edge</h4></p><p></p><p><p>That leaves Intel and the need for native leading edge capacity, and this is in some respects the hardest problem to solve.</p></p><p></p><p><p>First, the U.S. should engineer a spin-off of Intel's x86 chip business to Broadcom or Qualcomm at a nominal price; the real cost for the recipient company will be guaranteed orders for not just Intel chips but also a large portion of their existing chips for Intel Foundry. This will provide the foundational customer to get Intel Foundry off the ground.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Second, the U.S. should offer to subsidize Nvidia chips made at Intel Foundry. Yes, this is an offer worth billions of dollars, but it is the shortest, fastest route to ground the U.S. AI industry in U.S. fabs.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Third, if Nvidia declines — and they probably will, given the risks entailed in a foundry change — then the U.S. should make a massive order for Intel Gaudi AI accelerators, build data centers to house them, and make them freely available to companies and startups who want to build their own AI models, with the caveat that everything is open source.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Fourth, the U.S. should heavily subsidize chip startups to build at Intel Foundry, with the caveat that all of the resultant IP that is developed to actually build chips — the basic building blocks, that are separate from the "secret sauce" of the chip itself — is open-sourced.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Fifth, the U.S. should indemnify every model created on U.S.-manufactured chips against any copyright violations, with the caveat that the data used to train the model must be made freely available.</p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><p>Here is the future state the U.S. wants to get to: a strong AI industry running on U.S.-made chips, along with trailing edge capacity that is beyond the reaches of China. Getting there, however, will take significant interventions into the market to undo the overwhelming incentives for U.S. companies to simply rely on TSMC; even then, such a shift will take time, which is why making Taiwan indispensable to China's technology industry is the price that needs to be paid in the meantime.</p></p><p></p><p><p>AI is in an exciting place; it's also a very precarious one. I believe this plan, with all of the risks and sacrifices it entails, is the best way to ensure that all of the trees that are sprouting have time to actually take root and change the world.</p></p><p>                                                                            <br>                                                                        <br>
