The company derived ~76% (or ~$166.9mm) of its FY24 revenue (~$219.6mm) from Personal Genome Service (“PGS”) offerings – the one-trick pony of hocking a loogie into a test tube, slapping that puppy in the mail, and waiting a few weeks for the debtors to serve up a breakdown of your ancestry. In a nutshell, that’s the problem with the entire business; there’s no recurring demand, and competition from others, along with first-day faves COVID, inflation, and increased costs, only made matters worse. Most of the rest of that revenue ⬆️ comes from the debtors’ plain vanilla telehealth platform </span><strong>Lemonaid</strong><span>, coming in at a sweet ~16% (~$35.1mm), with the ~8% balance (~$17.6mm) deriving from research services, largely through a now-done-and-dusted deal with a </span><strong>GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) </strong><span>affiliate.*</span></p><p>So what’s new since our prior updates? For one, in a none-too-surprising move, employee count is down yet again, to ~286 as of the petition date, a ~20% fall from November ‘24’s already-decimated headcount of ~359.** For another, on March 21, 2025, the debtors executed settlement agreements addressing various litigation claims stemming from their cyber-security breach for $37.5mm all-in. Just in time for bankruptcy too: the debtors executed the definitive docs on March 21, 2025, three days before the petition date.</p><p><span>On governance, the debtors appointed </span><strong>Thomas Walper</strong><span>, formerly of </span><strong>Munger Tolles &amp; Olson LLP</strong><span>, to their board and special committee, where he rounds out the latter’s membership at four, alongside November ‘24 appointees </span><strong>Mark Jensen</strong><span>, </span><strong>Andre Fernandez</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Jim Frankola</strong><span>, and will undoubtedly provide substantial insight into the committee’s “</span><em>special review</em><span>” of claims against directors, officers, equity holders, and “</span><em>other</em><span>” company insiders.</span></p><p><span>And we already said this is a sale case, so turning to that, there’s, lol, no stalking horse. Even though the debtors began soliciting third-party interest back in January ‘25, engaging with 103 potential counterparties and executing 42 NDAs, and only received a single offer – from then-CEO and still-board-member </span><strong>Anne Wojcicki</strong><span> – that provided for an out-of-court solution, they couldn’t line one up. Oh, why “</span><em>then-CEO</em><span>”? Because on the petition date, Ms. Wojcicki clocked out from the company’s employ to focus on buying it back.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/09c708de-7943-4f9b-a9cc-4547a8a4cb34?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3777da4f-f872-4937-99f2-77f9ac8c7bf2_584x1094.png"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b4d9d94b-0778-470c-b862-81b68ce6fae0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">@annewoj23</a><span> on X</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Her enthusiasm was not shared, lol: </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/651c15eb-7bad-4f60-a9d7-df55f222ab03?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e852fe8-c715-4109-bc08-eb025e81dc5e_534x314.png"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/57d9ba9b-1008-48b8-b5c9-e6b8cc5ed6ee?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">@digijordan </a><span>on X</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Anyway, CFO </span><strong>Joseph Selsavage </strong><span>replaced Ms. Wojcicki as interim CEO and President, while </span><strong>Alvarez &amp; Marsal North America, LLC</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Matthew Kvarda </strong><span>is serving as CRO.</span></p><p>While we wait to see what Ms. Wojcickis’ next bid looks like, we can’t help but notice her prior offer of 41¢ per share and contingent value rights of up to $2.53 is looking more appealing by the minute.

Unsurprisingly, Ms. Wojcicki tossed in an undisclosed proposal for that too, but the special committee opted for </span><strong>JMB Capital Partners Lending, LLC</strong><span>’s (“JMB”) term sheet, which provides for a $35mm senior secured term loan.****** But because the debtors aren’t pulling up to St. Louis on fumes (not yet anyway — almost half of the debtors’ cash on hand will be burned on pro fees between the petition date and June 6), they’re not seeking immediate funding. Instead, court approval to flip the term sheet into definitive documentation sufficed. Approval of the term sheet paid out a $100k work fee and $700k commitment fee, equal to 2% of the total commitments, to JMB, while the second-day hearing will bring the definitive docs and, if approved, an immediate injection of $10mm, with the remaining $25mm locked up until the court approves a stalking horse agreement that either pays JMB off in full or has its support. Why that condition? Because Ms. Wojcicki’s 41¢ offer would have paid $12.1mm in current cash, and JMB definitively doesn’t want to get left holding the bag. The DIP will carry a 14% cash-pay interest rate and, in addition to those other fees, a 4% exit fee is doled out at each stage of funding, which should provide a nice return under a budget that forecasts getting (barely) through the sale with cash on hand and, therefore, zero DIP draws.</span></p><p><span>The debtors’ first-day hearing went forward on March 26, 2025, at which the court granted all requested relief and scheduled a second-day hearing on April 22, 2025.

K&amp;E is frustrated as sh*t. It was damn near palpable every time Mr. Sussberg and Ms. Greenblatt spoke. They’ve tried every logical approach, including inviting “</span><em>principals and advisors of both lender groups for an in-person settlement discussion at K&amp;E in New York on February 28, 2025</em><span>” to no avail. The ad hoc group of first lien lenders (the “ad hoc group”), represented by</span><strong> Paul Hastings LLP </strong><span>(Jayme Goldstein, Daniel Fliman, Jeremy Evans, Isaac Sasson, Nicholas Bassett), showed up. But the Freedom Lender Group? They had better sh*t to do apparently and didn’t make it, although Mr. Lauria tried to explain that away with this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“There was confusion on our end regarding the logistics and ultimately based on the large gap between the various positions, my clients concluded that it was not worth their time to fly cross country for a meeting that they felt was very unlikely to result in anything constructive.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>So was it confusion? Or that you weren’t going to get to a deal? Because we checked, and confusion aside, there are at least 22 </span><em>direct </em><span>flights per day from Los Angeles and Newport Beach, CA (where Freedom Lender Group members </span><strong>Irradiant Partners, LP</strong><span> and </span><strong>Pacific Investment Management Company LLC</strong><span> are based) to NYC, so getting there shouldn’t have been the issue regardless of when that “confusion” cleared up. </span></p><p><span>Listen y’all, you should listen to the audio — it’s that good and you can find it </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/cc66ce78-0a57-4ff2-a03c-729f899b67bf?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">here</a><span>.

As Mr. Sussberg bluntly put it, “</span><em>It's really not that complicated at the end of the day. The numbers pretty much speak for themselves.</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>📍That deal will likely result in the settlement of claims as between the OpCo and HoldCo debtors, with causes of action to be dropped into a single litigation trust and allocations to be resolved at a later time by a trust advisory board, with representation for GUCs and the official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”), whose counsel is </span><strong>Pachulski Stang Ziehl and Jones LLP</strong><span> (Robert Feinstein, Alan Kornfeld, Theodore Heckel, Bradford Sandler, Colin Robinson).</span></p><p><span>📍The settlement would also provide for all but a sliver of the equity to go to the first lien lenders, with that sliver reserved for the 2Ls (93% of whom are part of the Freedom Lender Group). To boot, the 2Ls would receive warrants based on </span><strong>Greenhill &amp; Co. Inc.</strong><span>’s expert valuation report and a juicy cash payment for peace and to stop the admin burn.

So very critically, Your Honor, even though the Freedom Lender Group does not care about the legal fees being expended by the estate, and they probably view this as house money at this point, they should definitely realize that by now, they're exposing themselves not to a free option, but potential risk if this goes forward.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>With each day that goes by, with each one of these hearings we have, and with each day, you have the debtors working towards trial, you've got the committee, you've got us working towards trial.

So the debt’s all over the place, which is one of the bigger issues in the cases, but we’re not there yet.</span></p><p>Turning to the business, the debtors have three, IP-based primary assets:</p><p><span>📍Library Assets. First, there’s a film library consisting of 108 feature films (the “library assets”) of which 91 were developed through co-financing and co-production agreements between the debtors and </span><strong>Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. ($WBD) </strong><span>(“WB”). All in, the library assets generate ~$50mm in revenue per year.</span></p><p><span>📍Derivative Assets. Second, the debtors also own derivative rights attached to their library assets (the “derivative assets”). Essentially, they provide payment rights for derivative productions, like sequels and prequels, based on successful movies, but unlike the library assets, the value is simultaneously “</span><em>more difficult to concretely ascertain</em><span>” but “</span><em>have historically brought monumental value</em><span>” to the debtors. (</span><strong>PETITION Note: keep that vague phrasing in mind as you make your way down</strong><span>).</span></p><p><span>📍Studio Business. Third, the debtors’ own a studio business, their newest venture, that launched in ‘18. Since then, it’s </span><em>developed</em><span> 99 feature films, 67 unscripted TV series, and 166 scripted TV series for the tidy sum of $47mm. Of those 322 ventures, you wanna take a guess at how many made it to production? It was THIRTEEN: six films, five unscripted TV series, and two scripted TV series. $3.6mm a pop. Damn near impossible to be profitable or sustain a new business in the industry on those numbers, and of course, the debtors didn’t, so we’ll peg the value of that one at </span><em>nada</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>But the failed studio business isn’t the only reason the debtors hopped the redeye from sunny SoCal to Delaware. No, they also have COVID (of course), the ‘23 writers’ and actors’ strikes, and “</span><em>streaming wars</em><span>” (i.e., getting beat down by </span><strong>Netflix ($NFLX)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Hulu</strong><span>, </span><strong>Disney+ ($DIS)</strong><span>, etc.) to blame.</span></p><p><span>Oh, and recall that WB relationship ⬆️? Yeah, that’s some sour sh*t now. Under the WB co-financing and co-production agreements, the debtors had a right to co-own and co-finance future works derived from shared assets. However, per </span><strong>Accordion Partners LLC</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Keith Maib</strong><span>, the debtors’ </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/4adadf1a-e0eb-4782-b567-a227b71f58c7?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">first day declarant</a><span> and CRO, WB froze them out entirely, and it got nasty enough that the debtors filed a complaint on February 7, 2022 to thaw those rights out, which also raised, of all things, a claim relating to the “day-and-date release”*** of </span><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em><span> on WB-owned </span><strong>HBO Max</strong><span>.

Johnny after wasting two hours. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In any event, the court kicked the complaint to a super secret, confi arbitration where it belonged all along under the agreements, so we can’t dish on the drama that unfolded there (😢). But that’s not to say we know nothing because WB wasn’t all-in on Mr. Maib’s dec and sent </span><strong>O’Melveny &amp; Myers LLP</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Steve Warren</strong><span> to the March 18, 2025 first-day hearing to fire some undodgeable truth bullets. Here’s him laying it out for the court:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The dispute between the parties grows out of the Matrix franchise: Matrix Resurrections. That was a co-financing arrangement. We had understood that Village had committed to co-finance. Based on that reliance on that commitment, Warner spent $200mm to produce the film, $100mm to market it, and then Village did not step forward and provide the co-financing. That’s led to a years’ long arbitration that’s gone on for quite a bit.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>We very much contest, I know you won’t be surprised to hear, some of the characterizations of the redacted section [of the first day declaration] regarding what happened in the arbitration. And I can share some other facts with you … Liability’s already been determined. The arbitrators have already decided that Village breached its obligations with respect to the Matrix projects. That's done. All that's left is to determine the damages. Again, with respect to the public record, I can tell you Warner took the position at the inception of the dispute that it was approximately $100mm, maybe even more, and that number hasn’t gone down.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>LOL, yeah, doesn’t seem like anybody’s being frozen out now, does it? Mr. Warren also didn’t like another thing, the debtors’ ‘24 “</span><em>bifurcation</em><span>” of assets. Mr. Maib barely mentions it, and only in connection with the prepetition marketing process. We’ll let him speak for himself first:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“During the first half of 2024, Goldman marketed a sale of the equity in the Company, seeking to sell the business as a going concern. While the Company received meaningful interest and entered exclusivity with a potential purchaser, the unknown outcome of the WB Arbitration ultimately stifled the ability to close the transaction. Thereafter, Goldman continued to market the Company and its assets – in whole or in part – to a broad array of potential purchasers. It became evident following negotiations with potential purchasers that the Company may receive the highest value for its assets by bifurcating them: the Library Assets as a distinct and high value asset, and the Derivative Rights and the Studio Business (together with the Library Assets, the “Business Segments”), which attach to greater liability.”****</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s it. No other references in the doc. Before we go back to Mr. Warren, we’ll highlight that the entities subject to WB’s arbitration claim are the four outlined in red in the bottom-right quadrant of the chart. You printed it out, right? Okay, have at it, Mr. Warren:</p><blockquote><p><em>“After Warner Brothers succeeded in establishing liability in the arbitration, the derivative assets were moved out of entities that were obligors, our obligors, part of ours, into newly-created special purpose entities for a dollar, for a dollar a piece. These are rights that Village had taken the position that were worth quite a lot of money, and for a dollar, they transferred them out and then we subsequently found out that those new entities guaranteed and pledged those derivative rights, which could not have been pledged under the agreements with Warner up to the parent’s debt. And we’ve taken the position that the transactions were fraudulent transfers, and we’ve taken the position that the pledges were fraudulent, intentional or constructively fraudulent transfers.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Hot damn, break out the 🍿; we love first-day fraudulent transfer flicks — we’re already stoked for the second-day sequel. Mr. Warren’s also got thoughts on the debtors’ proposed DIP, which is being provided by the senior noteholders of those newco SPVs, </span><strong>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board</strong><span> and </span><strong>Falcon Investment Advisors LLC</strong><span>, because it includes an all-debtor roll-up of what was ~$5.8mm in prepetition bridge financing. Debt that his entities are not currently liable on. But that only comes on entry of the final order, so it’ll either be resolved ahead of the April 11, 2025 second day hearing or be the subject of a brawl then.</span></p><p><span>The DIP’s otherwise a $12.8mm term loan, apropos enough in term sheet form,***** composed of $7mm in new money ($500k interim) and that roll-up ☝️. It carries a delectable 16% interest rate, a 3% commitment fee, earned on the petition date, and a 2% exit fee on the new money, earned on funding, and has priority over everything except the ABS notes with respect to their collateral (ergo, Mr. Warren’s beef). The DIP also had a “</span><em>novel</em><span>” feature: a transaction support agreement (“TSA”) attached, which the debtors tried to get the court to bless on the first day.</span></p><p><span>Who’s it with?

Disney Inc. ($DIS) absolutely besmirched their precious Star Wars IP, not to mention the recent wave of completely unnecessary and insufferable Marvel fare. Game of Thrones failed to stick the landing. All of the recent Lord of the Rings fare has been hot trash. And, man, this Matrix movie. Cynical hot garbage designed purely to take advantage of our collective love of nostalgia. The reviews featured above are, frankly, far too kind. The only properties that have stuck the landing are anything with Tom Cruise and Cobra Kai. Convince us otherwise.</h5><h5>**If you saw that formation date, immediately thought “fraudulent transfer,” and skipped down here to confirm, congrats, you’re today’s lucky winner!</h5><h5>***A “day-and-date release” means a flick is released on multiple platforms on the same day, bypassing the typical theater-only process, and is also known as the much-more straightforward “simultaneous release.” Unnecessary industry jargon, 🙄.</h5><h5><span>****Around early ‘24, the debtors engaged </span><strong>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ($GS)</strong><span> to lead a sale process, which ground to a halt by the end of the year on account of the debtors’ “</span><em>dire</em><span>” financial distress. Goldman was sacked in favor of SOLIC Capital Advisors, LLC in February ‘25 as the debtors were booking their flights to Wilmington (well, Philly).</span></h5><h5><span>*****The whole case may not get a DIP credit agreement. Per the term sheet, “</span><em>[i]f requested by the DIP Lenders, then the Debtors agree to enter into a credit agreement with the DIP Lenders on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in this DIP Term Sheet.</em><span>”</span></h5><h5>******That said, WB ain’t keen on letting secured claims creep into its debtor boxes, so they’re going to fight the roll-up all the same. Then, of course, there’s the whole fraudulent transfer litigation about those derivative assets being dumped into newly-formed SPVs.</h5><h3><strong>📚Resources📚</strong></h3><p><span>We have compiled a list of a$$-kicking resources on the topics of restructuring, tech, finance, investing, and disruption. 💥</span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/2b3e3125-b424-4106-80ab-8aa4485ea219?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">You can find it here</a></strong><span>💥. </span></p></div>
