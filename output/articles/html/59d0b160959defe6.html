    <div class="content"><p><font>September 2024<br><br>At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who<br>was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said<br>it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time<br>in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce<br>it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.<br><br>The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about<br>how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning<br>people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way<br>for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized<br>as "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He<br>followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to<br>figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying<br>how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's<br>free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.<br><br>The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful<br>founders we've funded, and one after another said that the same<br>thing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about<br>how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping<br>their companies, it had damaged them.<br><br>Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was<br>the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured<br>out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company<br>you hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a<br>professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that<br>to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that<br>managers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because<br>it is.<br><br>In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder<br>mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley<br>have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to<br>manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from<br>the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their<br>attempts to escape from it.<br><br>There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode.<br>Business schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the<br>experiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for<br>themselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can<br>search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well<br>understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the<br>ways it will differ.<br><br>The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular<br>design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as<br>black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up<br>to them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details<br>of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.<br><br>Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great<br>when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging<br>from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out<br>to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company<br>into the ground.<br><br>One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders<br>afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're<br>being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they<br>have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working<br>for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees<br>with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken.<br>But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders<br>themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level<br>execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the<br>world.<br><font>[]</font><br><br>Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going<br>to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company<br>only via his or her direct reports. "Skip-level" meetings will<br>become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a<br>name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge<br>number of permutations to choose from.<br><br>For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he<br>considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were<br>not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the<br>force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And<br>yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big<br>company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept<br>having these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of<br>another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We<br>still don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode.<br><font>[]</font><br><br>Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way<br>they ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount<br>of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp<br>they are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even<br>vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn<br>trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode.<br>But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples<br>of individual founders groping their way toward it.<br><br>Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that<br>once we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual<br>founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing<br>what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse.<br><font>[]</font><br><br>Curiously enough it's an encouraging thought that we still know so<br>little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved<br>already, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad<br>advice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run<br>their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[]<br>The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be<br>to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at<br>managing up. And I don't think anyone with knowledge of this world<br>would dispute that.<br><br>[]<br>If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread<br>that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it,<br>we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth<br>on the org chart of those invited.<br><br>[]<br>I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as<br>the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start<br>misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they<br>should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren't<br>founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may<br>even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it<br>doesn't; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad<br>CEO can do.<br><br><br><br><font><b>Thanks</b> to Brian Chesky, Patrick Collison, <br>Ron Conway, Jessica<br>Livingston, Elon Musk, Ryan Petersen, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan<br>for reading drafts of this.</font><br><br></font></p></div>
