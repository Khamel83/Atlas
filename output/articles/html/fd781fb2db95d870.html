        <blockquote>The City of Angels has always been pegged as a dream destination for world travelers. It was named the sixth-most instagrammed city in 2016 — an indicator of its 21st century popularity — and as a testament to its status as one of the world’s great cultural destinations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) just named Los Angeles as the host city of an upcoming Olympic Games.

But not everyone has the time — or the points and miles — to travel there, so if you haven’t yet planned your beach vacation or are waiting for the summer season to cool off before heading to Disneyland, we have some some amazing Instagram photographers to satiate your LA travel appetite.

1. @nathanielwood

Photographer Nathaniel Wood has the inside scoop on what’s new and happening, inviting outsiders to take a look at the city through his lens with a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. His subjects? The quintessential LA trifecta: sun, celebrities and people who want to be celebrities.

2. @killthecity

Nick Rufo, another Angeleno photographer, loves his city and wants others to see its beauty. His style — he shoots mainly landscapes and the occasional portrait — has drawn its fair share of fans and he’s amassed over 10,000 followers, with photos ranging from angelic blue skies and skyscrapers to portraits of up-and-coming rappers and skateboarders.

3. @john.logic

A 21-year-old SoCal native, John Logic has been taking photos for just over two years.
