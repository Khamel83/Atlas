Airfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using The Platinum Card® from American Express, you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family.

Now’s a great time to plan your fall (technically spring) getaway to the South Pacific. Qantas and Virgin Australia are currently offering flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to major cities in Australia and New Zealand, such as Auckland (AKL), Brisbane (BNE) and Sydney (SYD), from $707 round-trip. The low fares are available for travel from August through December 2018 so you’ll get to enjoy comfortable temperatures and avoid larger summer crowds.

You don’t need any tricks to get these prices, just head to Google Flights and plug in your desired departure city. After finding dates that work best for you, book with the airline directly or with an OTA such as Expedia or Priceline. As a reminder, if you’re an Amex cardholder, you may be eligible for discounts on Qantas flights by booking through The Travel Collection.
