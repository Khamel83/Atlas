Would this year's product keep up with the demands of the country's millions of general managers? The engineers, who were brought in from departments across the company for this inaugural Sunday, were relaxed and excited; most of them wore jerseys. But as kickoff approached, and as desktop traffic spiked as meticulous GMs sought last minute lineup changes, the tenor in the room changed.
