Most recently, the company booked truck sales of $24.8mm for 3Q’24, bringing YTD truck sales for FY’24 to $61mm. Meanwhile truck sales cost of revenue came in at $82.2mm for 3Q’24 and $222.9mm YTD for FY’24. The company booked ~$200mm+ in GROSS losses in FY’23 and is on track to repeat in FY’24. A little further down the cash flow statement and you’ll find $400mm of incinerated cash through operating activities for the first nine months of FY’24.</p><p><span>Liquidity is getting dire. There’s $198mm of cash on the balance sheet </span><em>as of 3Q’24</em><span>, which, according to CFO </span><strong>Tom Okray</strong><span>, is enough to carry the company </span><em>to 1Q’25</em><span> — or, uh, not that far away from now:</span></p><pre><code><code>“We estimate that our existing cash is sufficient to fund our forecasted operating costs and meet our obligations into but not beyond Q1 2025.

In just the first nine months of FY’24, the company issued 5.3mm shares for ~$73mm of cash.

So </span><em>really</em><span>, it’s ~$115mm of “new” new money and otherwise a roll-up by any other name. In addition to that refinancing, the DIP also includes a straightforward, cashless roll-up of $442mm-$497mm of other non-first out 1L debt. So calling a spade a spade, it’s a 6.7 to 7.2x roll-up all-in, all subject to the final DIP order.</span></p><p>Typically, we’d expect the recently-empowered Office of the US Trustee (the “UST”) or, once appointed, an official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”) to take issue with that: higher ratios being objectionable and all for “reasons.” In this case, the UST was either asleep at the wheel or didn’t care,* and there’s no UCC in these cases, though that isn’t for lack of trying. The UST just couldn’t garner enough interest and threw in the towel on January 16, 2025. But perhaps that was to be expected because, after all, the debtors’ restructuring support agreement (the “RSA”), which has the support of 88% of the debtors’ prepetition funded debt, intends to ride general unsecured creditors (“GUCs”) through the bankruptcy unimpaired.</p><p><span>Well, </span><strong>Inmarsat Global Limited</strong><span> (“Inmarsat”),** an alleged unsecured creditor and unquestionable defendant of a debtor-filed adversary complaint,*** couldn’t stand for that and took it upon itself to “</span><em>fill the roll [sic] of estate watchdog and ensure some adversarial process is effectuated to ensure that any DIP Financing is in the estate’s best interest</em><span>.” On January 29, 2025, it filed a DIP objection, which, in addition to hating on the roll-up, picks fights about the DIP’s ~$100mm in fees, 17.5% interest rate, 120-day maturity (subject to five additional 120-day, lender-approved extensions), “other” overreaching terms (spoiler alert: it was the typical waivers), and, of course, the Delaware-standard 75-day lien challenge period. Such a fiduciary. Truly a shame (for Inmarsat) that its fees aren’t being paid by the estates, but, lol, it tries to fix that too by tossing in a token, unsupported, and throwaway request that Inmarsat’s “</span><em>work should be given superpriority status under Bankruptcy Code section 503(b)(9) as a ‘substantial contribution’ in these cases</em><span>.” Superpriority status? On what basis? Only Inmarsat could tell you.</span></p><p><span>To be blunt, aside from </span><em>maybe</em><span> the roll-up argument, the objection sucks, and even we — as card-carrying supporters of pushback on debtor bullsh*t — are puzzled by why Inmarsat chose to pursue it. The roll-up itself, including the refinancing, isn’t even the highest ratio we’ve seen approved, and more to the point, no one other than the DIP lenders, including Inmarsat, offered up financing, despite the debtors having had, as their counsel </span><strong>Milbank LLP</strong><span> (“Milbank”)(Dennis Dunne, Matthew Brod, Lauren Doyle, Andrew Leblanc) put it, “</span><em>the help of some of the most highly qualified restructuring advisors in the world</em><span>.” That’s right, the WORLD. </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c99427b1-88a9-4553-83c7-636807ed6088?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_455,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2537e652-498f-46c3-9f59-5b608e9c79fb_455x200.gif"></a><figcaption><span>Source: Tenor.

All of this was in documents filed right there on the publicly-available (and free!) court docket, well ahead of the objection.</span></p><p><span>You can see where this is going, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that each of the debtors, the ad hoc 1L group,***** and the ad hoc cross-holder group****** sh*t on the objection. In addition to thinking it’s meritless, they all believe Inmarsat is trying to blow up the deal because of its “</span><em>clear ulterior motive of obtaining the Debtors’ valuable spectrum rights, [which] clearly illustrates that Inmarsat is not looking out for the best interest of the Debtors’ estates.</em><span>” The cross-holder group goes on to point out “</span><em>Inmarsat’s best prospect for a full recovery [as a GUC] is the restructuring transaction already on the table</em><span>” because it’s </span><em>already</em><span> sitting behind a f*ckton of debt …</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/8fc15da1-2885-411b-8eb3-9b9c1c11847a?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefbcdd5f-7944-4c29-a528-d852313a7f1d_632x397.png"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e1f6e853-c58f-49be-9603-04984b472263?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">Dkt. 2</a><span>.

Money talks.</span></p><p><span>On the other issues, the debtors </span><em>et al.</em><span> made the arguments we identified☝️ and, on maturity, took the easy road out by drawing everyone’s attention to the fact that the DIP lenders have been funding the business since October ‘20 — that’s … </span><em>counting fingers</em><span> … 4.5 years — without receiving “</span><em>a single cash interest payment</em><span>” and “</span><em>there is no reason to believe that the DIP Lenders … will suddenly pull the rug out from under them.</em><span>” So even with the DIP’s initial four-month maturity date, the debtors are expecting the lenders to keep on extending and then work something out at the two-year mark so long as the cases haven’t gone off the rails. We buy that, and again, Inmarsat ain’t offering anything better (or at all).</span></p><p>The hearing on the DIP and objection is scheduled for later today at 1pm ET, where we expect the court to have little or no problem overruling any part of Inmarsat’s objection not withdrawn or resolved ahead of then.</p><h5>* We tried pulling the first day hearing audio to figure out what happened there, but the court, lol, forgot to attach it to the filing. Maybe the UST was preoccupied with objecting to the break-up fee contemplated by the debtors’ RSA-proposed transaction with AST &amp; Science, LLC, which, of course, was resolved consensually.</h5><h5><span>** Inmarsat is represented by </span><strong>Pachulski Stang Ziehl &amp;
