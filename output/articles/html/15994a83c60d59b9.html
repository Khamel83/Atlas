OXO Wine Aerating Pourer

Wine rule number 41,713: Tannins need to breathe. But that means waiting for a while between opening wine and drinking it, which is a non-starter. So just pop this $10 spout where the cork used to be, and it lets air in as wine comes out. Your Two Buck Chuck never tasted so delicious. Mmmm, tannins.

Atlas Obscura: An Explorer's Guide to the World's Hidden Wonders

Nootrobox Go Cubes

The mid-day cup of coffee is one of life’s most important rituals, a pick-me-up to stave off the afternoon crash. For when there’s not a good cuppa nearby, keep a pack of chewable coffee ($13.50 for six packs of four cubes) handy. Its makers even tweaked the caffeine levels to make your perk a little more even and a little longer-lasting. It’s not food, it’s fuel.

Appetites: A Cookbook

It’s almost not right to call Anthony Bourdain’s latest a “cookbook.” Sure, it has recipes, if you count “put in oven” as a step in a recipe. Mostly it’s a summary of what Bourdain has learned from years of eating: about how to cook, how to take care of the people at your table, and how to make meals feel as awesome in your home as they must in his. $22.

This is the sort of gift you give, then sit back and watch as the recipient wanders around the house for hours looking for stuff to fix.

Your phone case should reflect your personality, your mood, even your outfit. But all those things change, like, every five minutes. So get a bunch of cases, in different colors, all for $9. Then, pick your case every day the way you pick your shoes. The whole “keeps your phone from breaking” thing is secondary, really. It’s the look that matters.
