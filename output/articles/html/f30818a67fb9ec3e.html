The company’s findings? In terms of popularity, bohemian won out as the most searched overall in the country. It commanded eight states, from Alaska to New Jersey, scattered across regions. Victorian wasn’t too far behind, the most popular in seven states. Traditional decor is hot in Hawaii; Idaho’s fallen for shabby chic. The lone state to pine for coastal design was South Carolina, while modern farmhouse was only popular in Utah.

Of course, Joybird is working off the assumption that search frequency corresponds to actual popularity, so take these findings with a dose of skepticism. Browse the full list below. What most compels me: Rustic wasn’t the most popular design search term in any state, nor was “casual modern,” a category that didn’t even merit a place on the key of the company’s visualization! Poor casual modern. Always a bridesmaid.
