Barns that almost burned down. Pipes that burst. The man a mile down the road who built a fence. This chatty imparting of intel functioned simultaneously as a gesture of hospitality and a comical how-not-to primer, containing valuable survival and etiquette tips. Our town of about 830 residents more than doubles in size during the summer, when part-time residents like me arrive. The fence story suggested what types of behavior on your personal property were, and were not, considered neighborly in a town where zoning ordinances are few.</p></div></div><div><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Listen to this article, read by Kirsten Potter</h3></div></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p>“You won’t ever get rid of the magazine room, will you?” people asked. The magazine room is on our house’s second floor. It’s basically a vintage mood board, and more of a windowless crawl space than a room, accessible through what looks like a cupboard door. A much earlier resident, or successive generations of earlier residents, had patchworked the pitched, unpainted walls of the magazine room with clippings from what appeared to be fashion, adventure-story and homemaking periodicals dating to the first half of the 1900s.</p></div></div><div><div><p>We promised never to renovate the magazine room.</p><p>We promised to change very little about our house, at least what was visible from the road, including the 11-foot-tall deciduous hedge that ran the length of our yard and seasonally blurred our view of the traffic coming in and out of town.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><picture><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/21/magazine/21mag-Maine-images-02/21mag-Maine-images-02-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"></picture></div><figcaption><span>After a passing driver plowed through the hedge in front of their house, Julavits and her husband decided to replace it with a fence. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Fumi Nagasaka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>But then the hedge began to fail. An expert from a nearby nursery arrived with a clipboard and pronounced our hedge an invasive, nonnative weed, not worth saving. But we loved the weed. We topped it.
