Airfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card, you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family.

Start packing your bags for a trip to the 50th state. As competition heats up during an off-peak time, flights from California are pricing out for less than $300 round-trip. Meanwhile, the central US has multiple options for less than $500 round-trip. Even the East Coast can fly all the way to Hawaii for less than $600 round-trip.

We’ve listed the best options we could find below, but there might be even more deals we didn’t find. So make sure to do some digging on Google Flights if a city near you isn’t listed below.

The easiest way to find these deals is to search for cheap dates via Google Flights. Then click through to Orbitz, Expedia or the airline directly to book your tickets.
