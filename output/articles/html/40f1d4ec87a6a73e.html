Bonus for Transferring AMEX Membership Rewards Points to British Airways

The normal rate for transferring AMEX Membership Rewards points to British Airways Avios points is 1:1.  But with this limited-time bonus, you’ll get 1,400 British Airways Avios points for every 1,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points you transfer.

Just the other weekend, team member Meghan took advantage of this deal for a short-haul award ticket to Seattle from Missoula, Montana.  On British Airways’ partner, Alaska Airlines.

She loves the fact that because British Airways prices award flights according to distance, short flights cost fewer miles!

So if you’re planning to use British Airways Avios points to book an award ticket soon, you’ll want to take advantage of the 40% bonus!  Even if you don’t have a specific trip in mind, it could be worth it.  Because these deals don’t come around often.

Bottom Line

The 40% bonus for transferring AMEX Membership Rewards points to British Airways is ending on September 17, 2017.

If you have an upcoming trip planned and want more British Airways Avios points, this is a great deal!

Even if you do NOT have a specific trip in mind, it’s still worth considering.  Because you can use British Airways Avios points for cheap flights to fun destinations like Hawaii and Ireland.  And for short-haul flights within the US and Europe!
