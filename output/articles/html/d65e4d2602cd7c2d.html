We’re a full eight days into the new year and we’ve already had our first big chapter 11 bankruptcy of ‘25 with </span><strong>Ligado Networks Corp.</strong><span> (“Ligado”) — a company that’s been swirling around the bankruptcy bin since </span><em>the last time</em><span> </span><strong>Donald J. Trump</strong><span> was President of the United States. Don’t worry, we’ll cover (i) Ligado, (ii) the fact that — in a throwback to Trump’s prior presidency — coal bankruptcies are back in vogue, and (iii) much much more — </span><strong>Serta</strong><span>! — in our a$$-kicking paying subscribers’-only Sunday edition.

A lot of the testimony was a rehash of what we already heard on the first day, so we can spare you (consider yourself #blessed), but we sat through the whole thing: all eight godforsaken hours of it. During that time, W&amp;C (i) grilled the debtors’ investment banker from </span><strong>Ducera</strong><span>, </span><strong>Christopher Grubb</strong><span>, </span><strong>CRO David Orlofsky</strong><span> (of </span><strong>AlixPartners LLP</strong><span>), and </span><strong>CEO Andrew Laurence</strong><span> over basically each and every (reasonable) decision they made while negotiating the DIP and formulating the sale process and (ii) put on their own expert, </span><strong>Neil Augustine</strong><span> of Greenhill, to second guess each and every (reasonable) decision they made while formulating the sale process. What did we learn? Apparently there’s always </span><em>some </em><span>holiday to b*tch about — Mr. Augustine complained about pursuing a sale process over Christmas/Hanukkah/NY — and, of course, more time is always helpful (doubly so when it’s other people’s money being spent, 🙄). </span></p><p>While Mr. Lauria and Mr. Shore provided some entertainment along the way, it wasn’t lost on anyone that the Freedom Group was only there to stir up sh*t and make mountains out of molehills in an effort to create leverage for themselves (and maybe get some professional fees paid).

Or is this motion a proper response to a framework set in motion on day one of these cases at the behest of the senior creditors at the OpCos using their positional strength to wipe out the HoldCo estates and their creditors that presumes facts no one has even remotely tried to prove ...

Puff Daddy &amp; Mase) - 2014 Remaster</p><p>The Notorious B.I.G., Mase, Diddy</p><p><span>The debtors, like most of the others we reviewed in ‘24, suffered from increases galore. Like, ⬆️ operating and labor expense, ⬆️ insurance expense, and ⬆️ interest expense. The debtors also struggled to either make money off of existing contracts or maintain contracts and the wheels basically came off in ‘23.</span><span>⁷</span><span> These were not favorable trends going into a debt maturity — specifically, an October ‘24 debt maturity on the debtors’ pre-petition RCF. Basically this situation was a perfect storm of 💩. </span></p><p><span>And so the debtors — with an army of restructuring professionals in tow — spent the entirety of ‘24 trying to source an out-of-court solution to address their growing liquidity problem and RCF maturity problem; they brought on </span><strong>Lazard Freres &amp; Co. LLC ($LAZ)</strong><span>(Christian Tempke) and healthcare banking specialist </span><strong>MTS Health Partners</strong><span> (“MTS”)(Jason Schoenholtz) to conduct a marketing process of their behavioral health division, “Recovery Solutions,” with the hope that the proceeds could pay down the RCF and better situate the debtors for an extension of other debt. </span></p><p>That. Clearly. Did. Not. Happen. </p><p><span>And so the debtors found their way into chapter 11 bankruptcy, with a restructuring support agreement (“RSA”) (i) agreed to by the debtors and an ad hoc group of lenders composed of eleven funds: </span><strong>Arena Capital Advisors LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Bardin Hill Investment Partners LP</strong><span>, </span><strong>FS Investment Solutions LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Lord Abbett &amp; Co. LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Palmer Square Capital Management LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Prospect Capital Management LP</strong><span>, </span><strong>Ripple Industries LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>UBS AG, Värde Partners Inc.</strong><span>, </span><strong>WhiteStar Asset Management LLC</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Trinitas Capital Management LLC</strong><span> (the “ad hoc group”), and (ii) backed by about 85% of the debtors’ first lien lenders and over 80% of their second lien lenders.</span></p><p>Despite some bumps along the way, the debtors’ cases have progressed remarkably smoothly so far, in large part due to the apparent constructive approach taken by the debtors, the ad hoc group, and their professionals. Here are the highlights of the relief the debtors requested and subsequent developments:</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>DIP Facility</strong><span>. As contemplated by the RSA, the debtors sought approval of a $522,375,000 DIP facility composed of (i) a $105mm syndicated-to-all-lenders-postpetition-but-backstopped-by-the-ad-hoc-group new money component and (ii) a $417,375,000 prepetition secured loan roll-up (a 3.975:1 ratio).

During that interim period, the UST appointed a 10-member official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”),</span><span>⁸</span><span> and rather than have a contested DIP hearing, the lenders agreed (and no one else objected) to a final roll-up of 2.45:1, bringing it down to a total of $257,250,000 — over $160mm less!</span></p><p>The final DIP order also limited the DIP lenders’ credit bid right to the Recovery Solutions division of the debtors’ business (subject to a cap to be agreed among the lenders, the debtors, and the UCC, in a last ditch effort to drum up a competing bid), leaving cold hard 💸💸💸 as the only option for a Local Government or State &amp; Federal business bid and, following the closing of the sale of the Recovery Solutions business, the DIP will be deemed satisfied in full (after which the prepetition lenders step in as the relevant consenting parties with respect to cash collateral usage). Honestly, what a compromise by the lenders!</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Bid Procedures Motion</strong><span>. Shortly after their cases filed and to comply with the RSA’s timeline, the debtors teed up an emergency motion for approval of (i) fast-track sale procedures for the Recovery Solutions business (culminating in a sale hearing a mere six weeks after filing) and (ii) a slightly elongated sale process for their Local Government and State &amp; Federal divisions (with sale hearings to happen around February 4, 2025).</span></p><p><span>As suggested above, the DIP lenders are serving as a stalking horse for the Recovery Solutions business. As for the other two divisions, the lenders propose to purchase new equity interests in reorganized Wellpath via a direct private placement pursuant to a plan, subject, of course, to the aforementioned bid procedures and a 363 sale process and with respect to which the UCC reserved all rights.</span><span>⁹</span></p><p><span>Notwithstanding the debtors’ aggressive timeline, the UST didn’t object, and the court quickly approved the motion on November 18, 2024. But shortly after being formed, the UCC petitioned the court to pump the brakes on the Recovery Solutions sale — as always, more time was needed and, after all, it’s the holidays, 🙄. But after some conversations among the parties, all was well once again — the court entered a new, consensual bidding procedures order kicking out the Recovery Solutions dates by about a week, subject to certain automatic extensions, which have since occurred.</span><span>¹⁰</span><span> Bids for the Recovery Solutions business were due on January 6, 2025, and … well … this 👇. </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/99a506c3-e859-42ba-899c-a5e3536001f0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1302,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05ec11b-17cf-425e-a41e-d86fcc736980_651x374.png"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 817.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A hearing is scheduled to take place later today, January 8, 2025, wherein the debtors will seek approval of the sale. </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Bar Date Motion</strong><span>. As most of our readers know, bar date motions are pretty routine and typically don’t get a lot of attention. That wasn’t the case here: given the unique situation in which many of the debtors’ creditors find themselves (you know, behind bars), the bar date motion received some unexpected commentary, namely, from the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Human Rights Defense Center, Public Justice, and Rights Behind Bars, who bandied together and filed an amicus brief. That brief noted what might be considered obvious on reflection: (i) mail service in prisons and jails sucks and requiring the incarcerated, who don’t have regular postal service access or any internet access, to return proofs of claim within 30 days was a bit much and (ii) documents full of legalese can be difficult to understand even for those out there who spent 3 years in law school. </span></p><p>To their credit though, the debtors and the UCC bent over backwards to address their concerns and revised the materials to generally make it easier for those individuals to understand what they need to do and get their claims on file, including by (i) kicking out the deadline to file from 30 to 100 days post-service, (ii) allowing claims to be filed English or Spanish, and (iii) streamlining the process by which relevant debtors are identified.</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Stay Extension and Relief Motions</strong><span>. Oh boy, are these both messy and fun. Because Wellpath contracts with government entities and provides health services to individuals in — we’ll say — less than ideal environments, they and many of the folks they’ve ever been associated with, including their equity sponsor H.I.G., their D&amp;Os, and doctors, have been on the receiving end of a variety of claims and lawsuits, including “1983 claims.” For those that don’t dabble in that area of the law, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lets individuals sue for violations of their constitutional rights, such as, for example, denying them necessary medical services while incarcerated. What kind of violations have (allegedly) occurred? About as bad as you can imagine. </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/54b41d3e-20b5-4d89-bce0-aa3cc060e7e5?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">Here</a><span>’s what one court found in a prepetition lawsuit:</span></p><pre><code><code>“[T]here was an avalanche of evidence presented to the jury that [one debtor’s] deliberate indifference [in addressing a patient’s medical needs] caused the constitutional violations inflicted on [her], resulting in her pain, suffering, and death.”</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ea912f2f-b9a8-4e47-943f-173645d7c25d?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122a7fd7-101d-4cff-972a-3ef43ffa000c_480x269.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But because the lawsuits involve non-debtors and could result in debtor indemnity obligations, the erosion of insurance policies, and the like, the debtors endeavored to “extend” the automatic stay to certain of their non-debtor affiliates and equity sponsor during their chapter 11 cases.</span><span>¹¹</span></p><p><span>The court approved the relief on an interim basis without much fanfare, but understandably, not everyone is on board with this approach: the docket is </span><em>littered</em><span> with letters to the court (some, handwritten), objections, and even some motions to lift the automatic stay for lawsuits to proceed.

As such, until additional equity or debt capital is secured and the Company begins generating sufficient revenue and operating cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result of the Company’s acquisition of RCHI on September 10, 2024, the Company believes it will be able to fund its operations until the second quarter of 2025. In any event, if the Company is unable to fund its operations, it will be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include further curtailing or suspending its operations, selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to take any of these actions could occur at a time that is earlier than when the Company would otherwise exhaust its cash resources.”</code></code></pre><p>Indeed, 3Q’24 was the first quarter that reflected the acquisitions and the company posted operating losses of $1mm and a CFO of negative $1.5mm.
