We have plenty of records indicating mechanical wear and tear, but none showing that dinosaurs were beset by caries. This might be shocking since </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240331234716/https://www.ualberta.ca/school-of-dentistry/about-us/dentistrynews/2018/september/dinosaur-dentistry.html">some of the toothiest dinosaurs had extraordinarily thin enamel</a><span>, so it wouldn’t take much for caries to form. But even today, many animals renowned for their smiles don’t seem to get caries despite thin enamel—</span><a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jzo.12707">the alligator is a familiar example</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The standard explanation for the co-occurrence of thin enamel and absent caries is that the relevant animals are polyphyodonts,</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-5-143114296">5</a></span><span> meaning that their teeth are continually replaced over the lifespan. But this explanation isn’t that great unless you believe that teeth are dropped as soon as decay sets in, and that’s not realistic. More likely, the reason caries are so rare among so many animals is because their diets aren’t usually sugar-rich, and there’s just not much for </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>to ferment even if the bacteria has taken up residence in their mouths.</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-6-143114296">6</a></span></p><p><em>S. mutans </em><span>has a special affinity for sucrose—table sugar—, a disaccharide combination of glucose and fructose. While there are few animals whose diets are rich in sucrose, there are plenty of frugivorous animals who have fructose-rich diets. The fact that the first true fruits made their appearance in the late Cretaceous might go a long way to explaining why there are so few known frugivorous dinosaurs</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-7-143114296">7</a></span><span> and why caries haven’t yet been documented among them. I think this case is further strengthened by the finding that </span><a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c5ra11560d">dinosaur teeth often contained fluorapatite instead of hydroxyapatite like our teeth</a><span>. That means that if those dinosaur’s diets were conducive to </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> or were otherwise acidifying, their teeth would have been noticeably melted; not only that, the melting would have produced hydrogen fluoride, killing dinosaurs unless they had some never-before-observed means of resisting it.</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-8-143114296">8</a></span></p><p>So we’ll have to start the story of caries a little later than the dinosaurs.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95330-x">The earliest-known example of caries in a mammal was published in 2021</a><span>. </span><em>Microsyops latidens</em><span> was a stem primate found in Wyoming.

In the time period caries were most frequent, every sixth </span><em>Microsyops</em><span> specimen had them. Because we also have knowledge about their diets throughout the sampling period, this excess of caries can be used to affirm what I said above: </span><em>diet matters</em><span>. The period with the greatest frequency of caries seemed to be the one with the greatest levels of fruit consumption and thus the dietary environment most conducive to acidification.</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-9-143114296">9</a></span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gVUm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5530e16-6e8d-499e-a1db-4f2c0b09f299_1003x586.png"><div><picture><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gVUm!%2Cw_848%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5530e16-6e8d-499e-a1db-4f2c0b09f299_1003x586.png"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Selig and Silcox (2021), Figure 3.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Ancient monkeys don’t have anything on modern humans.

With the adoption of agriculture, height crashed, and by 3000 B. C. had reached a low of only 5' 3'' for men, 5' for women.

A revealing </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/30/4/881/1068944">publication from 2012</a><span> used sequencing data from 57 </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>isolates and three </span><em>Streptococcus </em><span>relatives and uncovered evidence that the </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>population exponentially increased right around the dawn of agriculture, with evidence for positive selection for fourteen genes implicated in sugar metabolism and tolerance to the higher levels of acid it would produce with humanity’s new diets. The authors noted:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Our estimates for the timing of the demographic expansion in S. mutans coincide with the origin of human agriculture [10,000 years ago]…. Numerous studies in physical anthropology have shown an increased prevalence of dental caries in human remains from post-agricultural societies (5–50%) when compared with remains of Mesolithic hunter–gatherers (0–2%). This pattern has been attributed to changes in diet and the consequent increase in consumption of carbohydrates in human populations after the development of starchy crops, leading to the establishment of infectious agents causing dental caries. Our timing and expansion estimates are consistent with </em><span>S. mutans</span><em> as a possible etiological agent of human dental caries; however, it is not possible to rule out other oral bacteria species as also contributing to the development of this disease.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>There’s considerable evidence that our dietary niche bred our dental predators,</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-12-143114296">12</a></span><span> and there’s also evidence that </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2536">the dietary shifts that accompanied the Industrial Revolution have promoted extremely cariogenic bacteria</a><span>.

But while most Americans have the ability to get their caries fixed at a dentist right away, the same isn’t true for many of the billions of other people currently living with untreated caries.

As a result, when the Third World starts eating like Westerners, the result is untreated dental decay. The stories about this sound fairly horrifying. For example, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9542392/">Cirino and Scantlebury</a><span> recounted that decay in developing countries “is usually left untreated until it becomes so extensive and/or painful that extraction is the only option.”</span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-13-143114296">13</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11931216/">Yee and Sheiham</a><span> wrote</span></p><blockquote><p>Three-quarters of the low-income nations do not have sufficient resources to finance an essential package of health care services for the children of their countries….

Analysis utilising some epidemiological disciplines has demonstrated that to treat dental caries by traditional amalgam restorative dentistry in the permanent dentition of the child population [(most of which reside in the developing world)] would… [require] financial resources beyond the capabilities of low-income nations.</p></blockquote><p><span>Left untreated, those childhood caries will also go on to become a bigger problem as kids age.

Caries in upper teeth can easily cause sinusitis and all the problems related to that too. In some rare cases, caries can lead to Ludwig’s Angina, endocarditis, septicemia, or cavernous sinus thrombosis. Your teeth are important, and failing to take care of them will result in reduced quality of life and might be your death.</p><p><span>Modern studies have related poor oral health to </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247073">suicidality</a><span>, </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/4/1291/6564484">caries have been related to mortality</a><span>, </span><a href="https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/39/1/BSR20181773/250/The-relationship-between-tooth-loss-and-mortality">repeatedly</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.123.042528">across races</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78724-1">in fairly select cohorts</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01934-0">through other proxies like tooth loss</a><span>.

Historically, caries have been a plague on humanity since the dawn of starchy and sugary diets, and they’ve undoubtedly resulted in millions of casualties. But today, they’re generally not deadly because we have modern dental care, so we’ve forgotten the real, human toll of caries, and we focus too little on the costs they place on poor, infirm, and incapable populations today. To put this in perspective, consider George Washington.</p><p>Washington’s teeth started needing to be removed when he was 24 years old. Eventually, he had no teeth at all, so he commissioned no fewer than four pairs of dentures during his lifetime. Washington frequently complained about his dental pain and the pain from his dentures.

Consequently, it became difficult to understand him in mid-life because he refused to wear dentures. Thomas Jefferson was renowned for his excellent oral health, as he had only lost a single tooth to decay by the time he died.

(2015)</a><span>, who wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>As mentioned above, the reason for the use of fluoroapatite by sharks in their teeth cannot be explained by an increased hardness. A better preservation against bacterial attack (caries) can also be excluded as sharks and marine reptiles regularly change their teeth. For land-living organisms such as the dinosaurs </span><em>S. maroccanus</em><span> and </span><em>C. saharicus</em><span>, it is particularly surprising that they have used fluoroapatite. This mineral dissolves in contact with acids (such as acidic fruits) below a pH of about 5. </span><strong>Contrary to hydroxyapatite as in human and mammalian teeth, it releases hydrofluoric acid (HF) which is a highly toxic compound. This will be rapidly diluted and removed for sea-living organisms such as sharks, but will remain in the mouth for land-living dinosaurs.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I thought this was funny, so I kept it in even though it doesn’t feel like it’s important and I personally don’t think meaningful levels of HF should accumulate from interactions with lactic acid. But I realize my opinion is not shared by all (including some dentists, one dental researcher, and one chemist I spoke to) and I could be wrong.</p><p><span>Given how fluoride works to strengthen teeth, I thought that paragraph sounded odd. </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0528.1999.tb01989.x">Fluoride both limits demineralization and enhances remineralization</a><span>. What I thought I knew regarding remineralization was that it creates a “veneer” with “a composition somewhere between hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite…. This new surface will be ‘fluorapatite-like’ in its properties so that the crystal will now behave like low solubility fluorapatite rather than the high solubility carbonated apatite of the original crystal surface.” This new surface is harder than the old one, so “subsequent acid challenges must be very strong and prolonged to dissolve the remineralized enamel.”</span></p><p><span>But the reason I might be wrong and HF actually </span><em>might </em><span>be a significant concern for dinosaurs could be for the same reason that it’s a concern for the bacteria involved in producing caries. As the paper notes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Perhaps the most significant findings in several laboratories are that fluoride cannot cross the cell wall and membrane in its ionized form (F-) but can rapidly travel through the cell wall and into the cariogenic bacteria in the form of HF. </span><strong>HF forms from F+ and F- ions as the bacteria produce acids during the metabolism of fermentable carbohydrates. </strong><span>So, as the bacteria produce acid the pH falls. A portion of the fluoride present in the plaque fluid then combines with hydrogen ions and rapidly diffuses into the cell, effectively drawing more HF from the outside and so on. Once inside the cell the HF dissociates again, acidifying the cell and releasing fluoride ions which interfere with enzyme (enolase) activity in the bacterium. Under these circumstances fluoride is trapped in the cell and the process becomes cumulative.</span></p><p>In summary, fluoride from topical sources is taken up by the bacteria when they produce acid, thereby inhibiting essential enzyme activity. This is the third “topical” mechanism of action of fluoride against the progression of dental caries.</p></blockquote><p>HF is at least produced in some quantity, even if it’s not produced in large amounts.

This process speeds up when the pH of the extracellular environment decreases, as this facilitates the association of H+ and F- to HF. Therefore, even when the extracellular pH lowers, F- and H+ accumulate faster in the cytoplasm, and the antimicrobial effect is stronger. The strong pH-dependence of the fluoride effect is well recognized. The inhibitory levels of fluoride for the glycolysis are as high as 10 mM at neutral pH but are only in the micro-molar range at pH 4.0.</p><p><span>The intracellular F- and H+ can directly or indirectly affect enzymatic activities and physiological processes in the cell, leading to lower acid production, acid tolerance, and adherence of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> to tooth surfaces. It has been found that enolase, which is involved in glycolysis, can be competitively inhibited by F-. This inhibition is observed for purified enolase from permeabilized cells. In addition, enolase is also indirectly inhibited by the acidification of the cytoplasm caused by the accumulation of H+. Moreover, enolase not only plays a role in the glycolytic process, but also catalyses the production of phosphoenolpyruvate for glucose uptake through the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system. Thus, the inhibition of the enolase activity by F- also has a negative effect on glucose uptake.</span></p><p><em>S. mutans </em><span>experiences rapid and dynamic pH fluctuations from pH 7.0 to below pH 3.0 in the oral cavity after dietary carbohydrate intake of the host. The ability of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> to withstand these repetitive cycles of acid shocks is defined as acidurance or acid tolerance. It is one of the major virulence factors of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>. In the presence of fluoride, this ability has largely diminished. The glycolysis of </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>stops at pH 6.0 in the presence of 10 mM F-, while in the absence of F-, it is only inhibited at a pH lower than 5.0. The survival rate of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> after exposure to a lethal pH (3.5) decreases 77% in presence of fluoride (5000 mM). The acidification of the cytoplasm </span><em>via</em><span> the influx of HF as well as the inhibition of the proton-extruding F-ATPase, accounts for the reduction in acidurance of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>….</span></p><p><span>Fluoride can affect the adherence of </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>to enamel, which is a cariogenic trait of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>. Yet, there is no consensus on how much fluoride influences the ability to adhere. While an obvious decrease in adherence of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> to hydroxyapatite was found with 500 ppm (26.3 mM) F- or even less in some </span><em>in vitro</em><span> studies, others reported hardly any change in adherence with &gt;5,000 ppm (263 mM) F-…. Whether the fluoride inhibition of the adherence of </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>contributes to caries prevention requires further studies.</span></p><p>In addition to the abovementioned actions, other mechanisms may play a role in the antimicrobial activity of fluoride. Recently, fluoride was found to inhibit alkali production. This is due to the inhibition of either urease or the arginine deiminase system. The former is very sensitive to fluoride, with 50% inhibition by 0.3 mM F-. The ADS, however, is less sensitive than the urease system, and its inhibition by fluoride requires low pH values. Fluoride can also affect metabolism by binding to pyrophosphatase in the presence of Mn2+. Pyrophosphatase is responsible for the release of pyrophosphate from nucleotide triphosphates and is therefore involved in a variety of physiological processes, including biosynthesis and regulation of metabolism.</p></blockquote><p>The importance of HF was mentioned a few times in the above, but I quoted more of what they wrote to emphasize that fluoride may have other means of acting as an antimicrobial. There is more literature on this and other means through which fluoride acts as an antimicrobial, but I believe this is sufficient to make a point.</p><p>Because I am open to the possibility that HF matters more than I think it does, I will maintain this part of the article unless someone can present some reason why it’s wrong. In that case, I’ll strike it out, this note will remain, and the new evidence will be linked here.</p></div></div><div><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-anchor-9-143114296">9</a><div><p><span>We see similar diet-caries correlations in other primates, like </span><em>Gigantopithecus blacki</em><span>, or even </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18116-0">in omnivorous bears like </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18116-0">Arctodus simus</a></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also interestingly, </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajp.23349">we see caries in contemporary primates</a><span> and they’re concentrated among species that eat sugary foods and on the anterior teeth, consistent with practices like “</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02192634">wadging</a><span>,” where chimps will hold something like a fig, honeycomb, or a bundle of berries in their front teeth to eat, like so:</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sfR6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F911aee40-5266-4851-882c-253c5df5a82c_2040x2864.jpeg"><div><picture><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sfR6!%2Cw_848%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F911aee40-5266-4851-882c-253c5df5a82c_2040x2864.jpeg"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-anchor-10-143114296">10</a><div><p>Areas for progress to be made remain in the less developed parts of the world.</p></div></div><div><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-anchor-11-143114296">11</a><div><p><span>Confirming that the caries findings have to do with the dietary niche, </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1318176111">hunter-gatherers with starchy diets have also had lots of caries</a><span> </span><em>before the Agricultural Revolution</em><span>.

The reason is that corn was imported without also importing </span><em>nixtamalization</em><span>. Since no one knew why </span><em>nixtamalization</em><span> was needed, no one thought to encourage it.</span></p><p><span>In the late-19ᵗʰ century, Christiaan Eijkman was studying </span><em>beri-beri</em><span>, a neurodegenerative deficiency of vitamin B1 that was common in southeast Asia. Eijkman found that having the disease was more prevalent among individuals whose diets relied on polished rice, inspiring him to hypothesize that polishing removed an antitoxin that protected against the disease. Shortly after this, studies on </span><em>voluntary </em><span>prisoners in Java demonstrated that </span><em>beri-beri </em><span>was attributable to a dietary deficiency. The scientist behind these studies proposed that vitamin B1—thiamine—was the cause and that </span><em>beri-beri</em><span> could be remedied by supplying this “vital amin” (an alternative spelling of “amine”)—the origin of the term “vitamin.”</span></p><p>Scientists now had an appreciation of the role of nutritional deficiencies in disease.</p><p><span>Later on in 1937, Elvehjem et al. used a corn-fed dog model to demonstrate that supplementing niacin could cure their black tongues and then they applied this to pellagra patients in the U.S. and Italy, curing them of their pellagra. But that wasn’t a sufficient demonstration, as the patients were hospitalized and cut off from other potential causes of the condition. So the </span><em>Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche </em><span>started seeking out people with pellagra in natural settings and offering them oral and intramuscular niacin as part of a trial. The tongue and mouth lesions, the skin lesions, and the anorexia quickly came to an end. The source of pellagra was discovered after 400 years of suffering, and now the condition is virtually nonexistent in Europe.</span></p><p><span>For further reading on the history of pellagra in Italy, see </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423012232/https://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2007%20vol85/Articoli/JassPDFAggiunte/Mariani2007.pdf">Mariani-Costantini and Mariani-Costantini</a><span>, and for more on globalization and health, see </span><a href="https://karger.com/jnn/article-abstract/2/2/91/181391/Nutrigenetics-in-the-Light-of-Human-Evolution">Verginelli et al.</a><span> A famous book documenting changes in dental quality—among other things—after the introduction of the Western diet is Weston Price’s </span><em>Nutrition and Physical Degeneration</em><span>.</span></p></div></div><div><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-anchor-15-143114296">15</a><div><p><span>I discovered this report thanks to seeing the numbers on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240204065635/https://www.history.com/news/dental-care-teeth-cleaning-through-history">this page</a><span> and thinking they were so unrealistic that it motivated me to track down the source, confirming that they were, in fact, correct.</span></p></div></div><div><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-rise-and-impending-fall-of-the#footnote-anchor-16-143114296">16</a><div><p><span>There was also less public resistance to vaccination for smallpox than there is to certain other common disease vaccination campaigns today, although there </span><em>was </em><span>still resistance and vaccine skepticism.
