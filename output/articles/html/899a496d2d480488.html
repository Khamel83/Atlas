You might even consider the offer: outwit assassins for 30 days and win $1 million.</p><p>It’s a risk that Tommy, played by Jake Johnson, is willing to take in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/movies/self-reliance-review.html">Self Reliance</a>,” the dark comedy on Hulu that he also wrote and directed.</p><p>Johnson, 45, was antsy during the pandemic when he decided the time for this project was now.</p><p>“When you get on this roller coaster, you don’t know how long you’re going to be allowed to play while you’re here,” he said in a video interview from the studio he built for podcasts and Zoom calls in his Pasadena, Calif., home. “You should take chances and experiment. And if you have a relationship with an audience, you should be presenting new options.”</p><p>Johnson is best known as an actor in movies and television, particularly the sitcom “New Girl,” which ran for seven seasons and is one of the reasons Anna Kendrick and Samberg agreed to come aboard “Self Reliance.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Having somebody as funny as him start the movie, it sets the tone in the way that I want this movie to be viewed,” Johnson said before talking about losing at chess, carpentry mishaps and out-of-this-world restaurants. “And that is: sit back, have a glass of wine or smoke a joint or whatever you like to do and enjoy it. It’s a ride.”</p><p>These are edited excerpts from the conversation.</p><p>1</p><h3><span>My Twin Daughters</span></h3><p>When I had kids, they become such a dominant part of my life.
