        <blockquote>Creative destruction has defined the retailing business since the moment after its birth. Today it bears the face of Jeffrey Bezos and the name Amazon.com, the internet-based retailer Bezos founded in 1994 that changed the way America shops, and even lives. As Amazon has grown into a behemoth, traditional retailers have been forced to adapt in radical ways. Many have failed, and the casualties are mounting by the day.

But don’t mourn yet for a sector still beloved by consumers—and one that still could offer potentially rich rewards for investors.
