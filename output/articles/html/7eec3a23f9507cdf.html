While progress in reducing inflation has been broad based, recent readings remain somewhat above our 2 percent objective. The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue. We see ongoing progress in categories that remain elevated, such as housing services and the market-based components of non-housing services. Inflation can be volatile month-to-month, and we do not overreact to one or two readings that are higher or lower than anticipated. Data released last week showed that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. We pay close attention to a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, and some near-term measures have recently moved up. We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.”</code></pre><p>He continued:</p><pre><code><code>“Looking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.

Policy is not on a preset course. If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.”</code></code></pre><p>We meeaaan … what, realistically, was he gonna say?

Sixteen years later EAT sold OTB — which at that point had grown to 160 “cantinas” — to </span><strong>Golden Gate Capital</strong><span>, which, four years later, flipped this hot enchilada to </span><strong>Argonne Capital Group</strong><span> (“Argonne”).

You know what’s not unique? A slimmed-down casual restaurant chain in bankruptcy court. That’s right: there’s … literally … nothing … unique … about … that.

Yeah, sure, we’ll go with that: unoriginal. Inflation — particularly in the form of labor costs — impacted menu prices, which outpaced the rising cost of groceries and so people stayed the eff home. Or at least they sure as sh*t didn’t go to OTB. The rising minimum wage rate in several of the states within which the debtors operate also impacted the debtors, compressing margins and affecting the debtors’ ability to recruit and maintain their workforce.
