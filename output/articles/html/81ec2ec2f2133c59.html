I’ve divided the list into several categories: “TV Everywhere” apps, which are associated with traditional cable stations; TV streaming services, which are an alternative to cable; and standalone, specialized apps.

We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used apps, games, and utilities. Look for our picks for iPhones, PCs, and Mac; our favorite games for iOS and Android, and our top choices for the PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch.

TV Everywhere apps

These are apps that require a cable account login to get the most from them. If you want to watch full-length episodes, you’ll have to sign in. Most major cable networks have their own app.

There’s nothing necessarily better about watching your programs via these standalone apps versus just pulling up the on-demand options for these channels on your cable box. But if you prefer to keep things separated or hate your cable interface, they’re a nice option to fall back on. I’ve listed them here along with the services where they’re available.

Note that many of these apps now accept login credentials from DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other OTT TV providers such as FuboTV.

TV streaming services

Over the last couple years, we’ve seen a wave of internet TV apps that you can subscribe to as a replacement for cable — or if you don’t have cable to begin with. Prices range from $25 for Sling TV up to over $70 for the most complete channel packages from DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. You’ll definitely want to reference our Cord Cutter’s Guide for help in picking the one that offers your favorite channels.

Standalone streaming apps

        Roku

These are either the streaming versions of specific channels, or offer specialized content. My list includes the obvious essentials such as Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video, but I’ve added others that aren’t quite as well known. I won’t bother describing the obvious must-haves to you, but I’ve included some comments about some of the lesser-known apps you might want to consider.

CBS All Access

CrackleNetflix stole away Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, but Crackle still has an okay mix of movies to stream. It’s a good Sunday afternoon service.

Crunchyroll

DC Universe

ESPN+

Pandora

PBS

PBS Kids

Plex

The Roku ChannelDecent choice for random older movies if you’re okay with plenty of ads.

Vudu Walmart’s Vudu is probably the best single source for 4K HDR / Dolby Vision movies if you don’t mind paying to rent or purchase them individually.

WWE Network
