        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The concept for the +x Bookshelf originated as a shelving solution to match the angle of the pitched roof of our firm's office, located in a traditional Beijing courtyard house. From that starting point, People's Industrial Design Office (PIDO) continued to develop +x Bookshelf components into a flexible, modular shelving system with limitless possibilities.

This form comes with a range of new potential uses: its application can be as varied as covering an entire wall or functioning as a freestanding mid-height spatial divider. A wooden base is provided for the freestanding iteration.</p><p>The shelves of the +x Bookshelf are 3mm thick anodized aluminum and come in many different colors. Together, the reflections on the aluminum shelves create a color-blending effect. The shelves can also be inserted with different orientations, allowing for several nodal modulations. The frame of the bookshelf is steel and can be completely flat-packed for efficient shipping. The bookshelf can be assembled simply, by screwing together its various parts. </p><p><i>Material: Steel, Aluminum</i></p>                            </section><br><br>                <div> </div><br>        <br><br>                <br><br><br><div><br>    <ul><br>        <li><br>            <div>o<br>                <div> 1 </div><br>            </div><br>            <br>            <div>Favorite This</div><br>        </li><br>       <br>        <br>    </ul> <br></div><br><br><br><br>        </div><br>        <div><br>            <br>    <br><ul><br>                <li><br>                <br>                <div><br>                    <br>                </div><br><br>            </li><br>            <li><br>            <br><br><br>            <div><br>                <br>            </div><br><br>        </li><br><br><br><br>    <li><br>        <br>    <br><br>    <br><br>    <div><br>        <br>        <h3>Join over 240,000 designers who stay up-to-date with the Core77 newsletter.</h3><br>        <br>        <span>Subscribe</span><br>        <p>Test it out; it only takes a single click to unsubscribe</p><br>    </div><br><br>    <br>    <br><br>    </li><br></ul><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </div><br>    </div><br>                   <br></p></div>
