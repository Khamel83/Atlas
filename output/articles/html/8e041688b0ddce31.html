This was the most fascinating election of my lifetime.</p><p><span>Back in November 2022, I wrote a piece called </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/206fe588-d24f-4aa7-bcff-79f0b3b55913?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Decentralization</a></em><span>, arguing that: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>We‚Äôre heading towards an era of greater decentralization on all fronts ‚Äì geopolitics, finance, education, journalism, and energy are just a few examples ‚Äì driven by technologies including, but not limited to, the internet. This newly decentralized era will require new infrastructure and organizing principles that can adapt to the chaos and complexity inherent in decentralized systems.</em></p></blockquote><p>This election was a perfect example of what I meant. </p><p>There were two new, defining things this cycle that weren‚Äôt there the last time:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Going Direct</strong><span>. The Trump campaign‚Äôs strategy involved speaking directly to the people, often through long podcasts, as opposed to letting the media define their message. I think </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/8be21fb0-ff23-4553-bfc8-93a78d0ce9ae?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Jared Kushner‚Äôs appearance on Lex Fridman was a turning point</a><span>, and Elon Musk buying X and letting people say whatever they want was a key factor. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Prediction Markets.</strong><span> Platforms like </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/27ee58ef-ab34-4501-979b-9254d831c5b3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Polymarket</a><span> and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/5589543f-8b05-43a8-812f-b8c19eed7906?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Kalshi</a><span> let people put their money behind their predictions, and outperformed traditional polls or media prognostications. Look at that meme! Polymarket nailed it two weeks out!</span></p></li></ol><p>These two things are more related than they seem.  </p><p>Going direct creates a more chaotic information environment. Anyone can get out there and tweet, write, or podcast a firehose of information at people, and people can choose to read or listen to whatever they want. There is no Dan Rather figure to package all of that information into a clean opinion. </p><p><span>It is messy ‚Äî a lot of what people tweet and say is outright bullshit and downright wrong ‚Äî but makes it more likely that the truth will surface </span><em>given the right tools</em><span>. </span></p><p>Prediction markets are those right tools. Anyone can take in whatever information they think is highest-signal, even commission information like the French Whale did with neighbor polls, and put their money behind their belief. </p><p><strong>We are shooting a firehose of information at each other, and the market is essentially paying people to pull signal from the noise, in a totally decentralized manner.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Prediction markets are part of the ‚Äúnew infrastructure ‚Ä¶ that can adapt to the chaos and complexity inherent in decentralized systems.‚Äù </p><p><span>Maybe more than anything, this election was a repudiation of the idea that a small group of chosen people ‚Äî no matter how smart ‚Äî know better than the market. This is </span><strong>Joy‚Äôs Law: ‚ÄúNo matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.‚Äù</strong></p><p>Prediction markets can bring us closer to truth by incentivizing ‚Äúmost of the smartest people‚Äù to work on behalf of finding it, even if they‚Äôre not an American political scientist but an anonymous French ex-trader. </p><p>While politics were the first really big use case for prediction markets in the US, I expect that with greater liquidity on the platforms, we‚Äôll see more accurate predictions for all sorts of things. If ‚ÄúAll evils are caused by insufficient knowledge,‚Äù this is a good step towards eradicating it. </p><p><strong>(2) Introducing: Ulysses</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Our mission is to build technology for ocean stewardship and help usher in an age of abundance.</em></p></blockquote><div><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/3bdc0e73-7250-471b-b030-1da3aa019330?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,h_1100,c_pad,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/l_play_button_usfui2,w_144,e_colorize:0/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F151321112%2F6d0aa8cf-1b88-4171-9bf5-9083e0671f15%2Ftranscoded-00001.png"></a></div><p><span>Yesterday, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/60658422-56f4-477f-9838-c1d5d2371e72?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Ulysses</a><span> came out of stealth and unveiled its plans to build underwater autonomous drones that they‚Äôll use to restore sea grass (35x better at carbon capture than rainforests) ‚Ä¶ to start.

Treating the mice with drugs that blocked CGRP-RAMP1 signaling led to reduced pain and lesion size.</em></p></blockquote><p>Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, inflammation, and sometimes infertility. It impacts about 10% of women of reproductive age in the U.S. or about 6.5 million people. It‚Äôs not only painful but is particularly scary as it can infertility. Frankly, if you‚Äôre a brute like me it‚Äôs not likely a condition you think about a lot, until it impacts someone you love, but it‚Äôs actually quite widespread.</p><p>Now, new research explored the role of neuroimmune communication in endometriosis, focusing on the calcitonin gene‚Äìrelated peptide (CGRP) and its receptor, RAMP1. The study shows that CGRP contributes to pain and lesion growth by altering macrophages into a pro-endometriosis phenotype. Blocking CGRP-RAMP1 signaling with FDA-approved drugs in mice reduced pain and lesion size.</p><p>There‚Äôs currently no cure for endometriosis and treatment options are limited to opioid-based pain relievers, hormonal therapy that eliminates menstruation, and some surgical options. But new therapeutic targets, such as the CGRP-RAMP1 signaling pathway, may offer future non-hormonal and non-opioid treatment options.</p><p><em>Astrid Landon for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>A test based on biomarkers aims to speed up diagnosis and enable prompt treatment. But not everyone is convinced.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e538c095-1265-4189-ab8b-b87bac405b8d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc9c672-bd19-4be0-bb08-c0daabc7ecfa_767x511.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>A new blood test called EDIT-B, developed by French start-up Alcediag, uses RNA biomarkers to differentiate bipolar disorder from depression, aiming to cut diagnosis times from years to weeks. Bipolar disorder involves mood swings between mania (highs) and depression (lows), while depression is characterized by persistent low mood without manic episodes‚Ä¶the difference between the two may be observable in our genes. The EDIT-B test identifies differences in RNA editing‚Äîcellular processes that regulate gene expression‚Äîusing specific biomarker patterns and an AI algorithm to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression with high accuracy. It analyzes these unique RNA editing signatures in a blood sample to classify patients.</p><p>This was surprising to me: it currently takes 7-10 years to accurately diagnose bipolar disorder. Diagnosing bipolar disorder takes particularly long because its symptoms overlap with other conditions and require observing mood swings over time. The EDIT-B test drastically reduces that diagnosis window ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt rely on observing behavior and mood swings over long periods of time, it relies on accurately reading biomarkers in your blood.</p><p>But the test is not without criticism, with skeptics pointing out lack of verification of the tests results, small sample sizes, and the potential influence of medications on the biomarkers it reads. Ultimately, France and Italy have adopted the tests in recent years signaling that the potential benefits of bipolar disorder early diagnosis outweigh their concerns with the testing methodology.</p><p><em>Gracner et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We found that early-life rationing reduced diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35% and 20%, respectively, and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/4e57590c-f856-4220-8c27-b88bb26c33de?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1280,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44ff97cb-24ba-4328-ae4c-4e377dbc6cf4_640x461.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>The results of this study should come as a surprise to‚Ä¶absolutely no one. The study, leveraging post-WWII UK sugar rationing data, found that children conceived and born during rationing had a 35% lower risk of diabetes and a 20% lower risk of high blood pressure later in life. The study analyzed 60,000 individuals and found the strongest benefits among those exposed to sugar rationing both in utero and during early childhood ‚Äî meaning the earlier you can stay off the sweet stuff, the better.</p><p>The study supports the idea that early nutrition has a lasting impact, even later into life. It‚Äôs not quite clear whether this impact is due to epigenitic changes ‚Äî does consuming more sugar at younger ages alter your gene activity ‚Äî or consumption behavior ‚Äî does consuming more sugar at younger ages build a sugar habit that‚Äôs tough to kick ‚Äî or some combination of the two. But either way, it‚Äôs quite clear that inappropriate sugar consumption, really at any age, can have a deleterious impact on your health. </p><p>RFK, Jr. is wrong about a lot of things, but I do certainly think he‚Äôs onto something with his criticisms of modern food systems. Here‚Äôs to hoping he takes aim at sugar instead of vaccines. </p><p><strong>Bonus 1:</strong><span> </span><strong><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6b617a7f-8adf-4257-a505-179748c549d1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Identity politics isn't working</a></strong></p><p><em>Noah Smith for Noahpinion</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Identity politics ‚Äî viewing racial groups as homogeneous ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù to be targeted with appeals to collective grievances ‚Äî is not an effective way of winning over Hispanic (or, probably, Asian) voters.</em></p></blockquote><p>OK, final take on politics here. This one from me, Dan.</p><p>Identify politics did not work as expected in the 2024 Presidential Election. This time around, that turned out to be a particularly positive trend for the Republicans, but I think the overall shift away from identity politics will benefit both parties, and the American people, going forward. </p><p>The idea of the two party system has always confounded me. Because I believe X thing to by true, I therefore must also support Y and Z thing, which has nothing to do with X. Identity politics takes it one step further: because you were born into a certain racial group, you are expected to adopt X belief in the first place, which then comes along with needing to support Y and Z. It‚Äôs downright patronizing. And I don‚Äôt think it holds up in the dynamics that Packy described above: with access to more information, a voter is less likely to just blindly follow the party line.</p><p>Hispanic men in the U.S, for example, are often portrayed as a unified voting bloc yet their political preferences vary widely based on factors like age, socioeconomic status, and and country of origin. A Cuban-American in Florida has very different political motivations than a Mexican-American in California, but they‚Äôve been treated as the same, particularly by the Democrats who could, until recently, rely on consistent voting trends from the overall bloc. A Cuban-American man doesn‚Äôt necessarily align with Democrats on immigration policy, let alone economic and social issue, but has been grouped into this larger Hispanic male bloc that is supposed to vote Democrat. </p><p>This is not only a political miscalculation, but I think points towards a deeper issue on the American left today. The left has gotten away from individualism. This manifests in a bunch of dangerous ways: group think, patronizing policies, and, yes, wokeness. If 2024 taught us anything, it‚Äôs that expecting people to think in a certain way ‚Äî and then holding them to task when they don‚Äôt ‚Äî leads to backlash. People have too much information today to fall for it.</p><p>Going forward, I hope the left learns from 2024 and weans off its dependence on identity politics. Not only do they need to, if they ever want to win a national election again, but because I think the groups they aim to identify with will be better off for it. </p><p><em>Jamie Carter for Forbes h/t Ian Bremmer and Tim Urban</em></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/13b32968-4c68-4773-a865-46cff0642909?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1918,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facd56409-3f0f-46b9-baeb-ff11cd493249_959x460.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p><span>NASA‚Äôs Juno Spacecraft just sent back new images of Jupiter and they‚Äôre stunning.
