Bit of a return to normal this week: no election buildup and less election fallout. And a normal week is generally a pretty good week, if you‚Äôre paying attention. History-making rocket launches, breakthroughs in quantum mechanics, drug discoveries, and, yes, a dose of optimistic political news.</span></p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it.</p><p><em>Mike Wall for Space</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Today's mission aimed to do far more than just bring Super Heavy back to </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6b6e838a-bba8-45bc-bd1f-67b49283e75b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Earth</a><span> in one piece. SpaceX also wanted to put Starship's upper stage ‚Äî a 165-foot-tall (50 m) spacecraft called Starship, or simply "Ship" ‚Äî through its paces.</span></em></p></blockquote><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c0447755-984c-4724-808b-7a2e7072acf4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/T43sbhCKvBY"></a><p>It was just another day at SpaceX this week, when the company successfully completed its sixth launch of Starship. While flight data did not indicate a chopstick-catch landing was possible, the launch was still successful in all other regards.</p><p>The mission successfully tested Starship's reentry capabilities, including modifications to its heat shield and engine relight in microgravity, while also achieving a controlled splashdown of both stages. These advancements are critical for developing a fully reusable spacecraft capable of supporting lunar landings, Mars missions, and whatever other civilization-altering missions the company has planned.</p><p>It‚Äôs amazing that the company has turned launching and safely landing Starships into an almost common occurrence in such a short amount of time. As a reminder, Starship is over 400 feet tall, is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, and dwarfs the Statue of Liberty. We can now launch the Statue of Liberty into space and land it safely back on earth, and it‚Äôs not even a big news story anymore.</p><p>Elon is on an all-time heater.

His aggressive austerity measures have delivered astounding results: achieving a fiscal surplus for the first time in over a decade and reducing monthly inflation to below 3%, the lowest in three years. His administration has already removed or significantly amended over 300 regulations, and now alters around five regulations per day with the goal of making changes to over 4,000 laws. You may not like his style, but the results speak for themselves.</p><p><span>You may be asking yourself, ‚ÄúWhy should I care about what the President of Argentina is up to?‚Äù The answer is pretty clear: Milei‚Äôs approach to government efficiency and deregulation is serving as the playbook for the US Government‚Äôs forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) Don‚Äôt take my word for it ‚Äî both Musk and Milei are on record stating as much. Yesterday, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/2798526a-c1d7-40a5-a9fa-cb812dc76742?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Elon tweeted a video</a><span> of Milton Friedman doing the video version of Leonard Read‚Äôs </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/eced925c-ca27-4883-bccf-00c895f05d25?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">I, Pencil</a></em><span>. </span></p><p>Beyond our shared enthusiasm for governmental efficiency, three other things stood out to me from this conversation.</p><ol><li><p>It‚Äôs super refreshing to hear from a politician that is extremely well-versed in economics and doesn‚Äôt talk strictly in platitudes when it comes to the economy. Even if you don‚Äôt agree with all of his conclusions, you‚Äôd likely agree that he is well read.</p></li><li><p>Milei does about as good of a job as anyone explaining the origins and dangers of wokeness. His analysis is not inflammatory and doesn‚Äôt simply cherry pick examples from ‚ÄòLibs of TikTok‚Äô, but rather, it is rooted in a deep understanding of the history and philosophy of socialism.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/2236d5db-11b5-4ead-9474-774134071862?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">ElevenLabs</a><span> is sweet. The original conversation occurred between an English speaking Lex, a Spanish speaking Milei, and an interpreter. But the podcast was presented using an overdub from ElevenLabs that made it sound like a fully English conversation between Lex and Milei. It was a very high-quality overdub and, if Lex had not broken it down at the beginning of the podcast, I am not sure I would‚Äôve picked up that Milei‚Äôs voice was AI-generated.</span></p></li></ol><p><em>Yang et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>By coupling a bulk acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, the authors engineered a parameter regime in which a mechanical mode of the resonator inherits the nonlinear features of the superconducting qubit necessary for strong phonon-phonon interactions. They then demonstrated a full set of single-qubit operations on their mechanical qubit.</em></p></blockquote><p>Researchers have created a new type of qubit using mechanical vibrations, called a mechanical qubit, by coupling a resonator to a superconducting qubit. As a reminder, a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information, capable of existing in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) for advanced computing and information processing. </p><p>The mechanical qubit allowed them to engineer strong interactions between phonons (quantized sound waves) at the single-quantum level, something previously impossible in mechanical systems. They demonstrated full control of the qubit, including initialization and quantum gates, with the system showing remarkably long quantum lifetimes. </p><p>If you didn‚Äôt understand that, you‚Äôre not alone ‚Äî here‚Äôs why it matters: the breakthrough opens the door to using quantum sound for advanced technologies like highly sensitive sensors, powerful simulations, and efficient quantum computers. It‚Äôs a leap toward making quantum acoustics a key player in the future of quantum technology.</p><p><span>Separately, researchers showed that </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9cfbcc31-d88d-4499-b145-56079fab67ca?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">AI outperforms humans in quantum error correction</a><span>. </span></p><p>Progress in quantum is accelerating.

The approval represented a significant innovation in psychiatric medicine by targeting muscarinic receptors, a mechanism distinct from traditional dopamine-based drugs. Muscarinic receptors are proteins in the brain and body that respond to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and play a key role in cognition, movement, and other physiological functions. KarXT approval for schizophrenia has renewed interest in targeting muscarinic receptors for other brain conditions, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs.</span></p><p><span>Targeting muscarinic receptors, particularly the </span><strong>M1 subtype</strong><span>, could help treat Alzheimer‚Äôs by enhancing acetylcholine signaling, which is crucial for learning and memory. Activation of M1 receptors has been shown to improve cognitive function and may slow neurodegeneration by supporting brain cell communication and reducing the buildup of harmful proteins like beta-amyloid and tau. Importantly, this approach would not only treat existing symptoms of Alzheimer‚Äôs but may also address the underlying diseases.</span></p><p><span>We‚Äôre still pretty long ways away, though. Other muscarinic receptors drugs have failed to pass through trials. The challenge is due to the difficulty of selectively targeting specific receptor subtypes (like M1) without causing widespread side effects, as these receptors are found throughout the body. That said, the FDA‚Äôs approval KarXT </span><strong> </strong><span>has revitalized confidence in muscarinic receptor-targeting drugs and their potential for treating a wide variety of brain-related conditions.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/10825166-05fd-4b08-ab07-d7c0b7a333f2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">@SECGov</a><span> Chair.</span></em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9b31f722-6b7f-4744-8411-37354f1efd7c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1204,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ba36909-630f-47f6-8f5a-a826d85d32ab_602x242.png"></a></figure></div><p>Packy here.
