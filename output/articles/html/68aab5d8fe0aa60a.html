            <p>After British Airways devalued its program to eliminate 4,500-mile short-haul flights in the US, many US-based travelers wrote off the Avios program. There are still plenty of frustrations with the program — from fuel surcharges on British Airways-operated flights to connecting flights pricing separately. However, there have been a few nice changes recently that open an incredible sweet spot.</p><p>Last year, American Airlines changed its domestic first-class coding from F (first class) to J (business class). This changed nothing for AAdvantage awards, but this change halved the price of American Airlines-operated flights when using Avios. Last week, American Express improved the standard transfer rate from Membership Rewards to Avios to 1:1. If that wasn’t good enough, Amex and BA just launched a 40% transfer bonus.</p><p>Now, you’ll get 75% more Avios when transferring Membership Rewards than you would if you transferred them a week ago, and American Airlines domestic first-class flights are 50% less than a year ago. That means your Membership Rewards take you 3.5x further on AA domestic first-class flights than just nine months ago! The same sub-1,151 mile nonstop domestic first-class flight that would’ve required 37,500 Membership Rewards a year ago now costs just 10,750 points today — that means you can book several round-trips with the sign-up bonuses available with The Platinum Card from American Express or The Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN.</p><p>How about celebrating by flying in a lie-flat business-class product? While American has a frustratingly inconsistent fleet, it also has some of the best business-class seats in the skies on some aircraft. And, some of these are flown domestically on a somewhat consistent schedule. Now, with the transfer bonus running through September 17, you can try out one of these products for just 15,000 Avios — which you can get for just 10,750 transferred Membership Rewards (as transfers must be in increments of 250 points).</p><p>Let’s take a look at the routes you can do this on.</p><p>In This Post</p><p>Boeing 777-200</p><p>Katie and I enjoying dinner on a flight from DFW to MIA on the 777-200.<br>American Airlines’ 777-200 is so complicated that it takes an entire article to explain it. However, there are essentially just two business-class seat options. Both are lie-flat, but one is significantly more spacious and stable than the other. However, either one would be a huge improvement from standard domestic first-class products you’d find on other AAircraft.</p><p>From</p><p>To</p><p>Flight #</p><p>Depart</p><p>Arrival</p><p>Starting</p><p>Ending</p><p>Frequ</p><p>ency</p><p>DFW</p><p>MIA</p><p>905</p><p>17:00</p><p>20:55</p><p>now</p><p>Aug-3</p><p>Daily</p><p>MIA</p><p>DFW</p><p>61</p><p>9:10</p><p>11:11</p><p>now</p><p>Aug-21</p><p>Daily</p><p>DFW</p><p>MIA</p><p>905</p><p>17:00</p><p>20:56</p><p>Aug-4</p><p>Aug-21</p><p>Daily</p><p>DFW</p><p>MIA</p><p>2307</p><p>10:25</p><p>14:10</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>One-Off</p><p>DFW</p><p>MIA</p><p>905</p><p>16:55</p><p>20:43</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>Aug-31*</p><p>Daily</p><p>MIA</p><p>DFW</p><p>61</p><p>9:10</p><p>11:14</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>Aug-31*</p><p>Daily</p><p>JFK</p><p>MIA</p><p>235</p><p>17:00</p><p>20:12</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>Aug-22</p><p>One-Off</p><p>DFW</p><p>ORD</p><p>2332</p><p>7:55</p><p>10:11</p><p>now</p><p>Aug-20</p><p>Sunday</p><p>ORD</p><p>DFW</p><p>2334</p><p>11:45</p><p>13:59</p><p>now</p><p>Aug-20</p><p>Sunday</p><p>DFW</p><p>ORD</p><p>2400</p><p>22:15</p><p>0:27</p><p>Aug-3</p><p>Aug-3</p><p>One-Off</p><p>*Likely extends beyond August 31.

There are still plenty of frustrations with the program — from fuel surcharges on British Airways-operated flights to connecting flights pricing separately. However, there have been a few nice changes recently that open an incredible sweet spot.

Now, with the transfer bonus running through September 17, you can try out one of these products for just 15,000 Avios — which you can get for just 10,750 transferred Membership Rewards (as transfers must be in increments of 250 points).

Let’s take a look at the routes you can do this on.

American Airlines’ 777-200 is so complicated that it takes an entire article to explain it. However, there are essentially just two business-class seat options. Both are lie-flat, but one is significantly more spacious and stable than the other. However, either one would be a huge improvement from standard domestic first-class products you’d find on other AAircraft.

Boeing 767-300

While this business-class seat isn’t winning any awards internationally, the seat does lie flat, and it’s a huge upgrade from standard domestic first-class products.

Here are the routes and flights — starting from the nearly three-hour flight between Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA) down to the two-hour flights between Charlotte (CLT) and MIA.

AA’s mini-fleet of A330-200s is going to be cycled through the shop soon for a retrofit process, to add true Main Cabin Extra seating and a Premium Economy section. While the business-class cabin is being retained as is, the Envoy seats are a solid mid-tier and they lie flat. While there aren’t many domestic A330 flights, there’s one reliable one:

But What About Award Availability?

American Airlines has become known for having AAtrocious AAward AAvailability recently, but I’m finding a decent amount of award availability of some of these flights. The availability is helped by the sheer number of business-class seats on these aircraft (some have 45). Remember to use the best techniques when searching to save yourself time and hassle.

Here’s one 777-200 flight from Dallas/Forth Worth (DFW) to Miami (MIA) with seven business-class award seats available. Even better, a hot dinner is served on this flight.

Bottom Line

While it’s a lot more fun to fly these lie-flat business-class products overseas, it’s also nice to try them out on domestic routes. In addition to the extra space, I’ve found the catering to generally be better on these internationally configured aircraft. If you’re flying between one of the cities below, check to see if you can try out one of these aircraft for yourself using less than 11,000 Membership Rewards.</blockquote>
