We have the whole thing written and ready to go, and then boom: Bloomberg reports that TSMC‚Äôs Arizona manufacturing facility is producing chips at 4% higher yields than similar facilities in Taiwan. </span></p><p>That is huge. We‚Äôre optimists, and frankly, we were a little worried about TSMC‚Äôs ability to manufacture here. Less skilled labor, safety and management issues, all the things that normally get in the way of building things. TSMC pushed back its plans to start full production here by a year, then pushed back the launch date for the second fab. </p><p>And then they go and totally redeem themselves. Now, these are 4nm chips, not the 3nm chips TSMC makes at home, but a 4% improvement in yields shows that we can manufacture these complex little wafers here, might unlock billions in additional CHIPS Act funding, and might push TSMC to open all six possible fabs in Phoenix. </p><p>The way things are heading, we‚Äôre going to produce oodles of chips powered by gigawatts of nuclear energy while eagles fly overhead, kids eat apple pie, and someone terraforms the Arizona dessert in the background. Out with the longshoremen, in with the onshoremen. </p><p><em>Knierim et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a61148e5-5e1e-4268-a84e-29994c081688?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feea1d92a-6c9d-4622-9fc7-5bfc4238389b_1538x804.png"></a></figure></div><p>About 6 weeks ago, we covered the lithium boom in the the Smackover Formation region of the United States. That story covered how one particular entrepreneur was planning to use Direct Lithium Extraction, a methodology he developed back in the 90s, across one particular region of the southeast referred to as the Smackover Foundation.</p><p><span>A paper recently published in </span><em>Science </em><span>confirmed that that entrepreneur is on the right track. The researchers identified a substantial lithium resource in southern Arkansas. Using an AI model trained on geological, geochemical, and temperature data, the team predicted lithium concentrations across the region and estimated the formation contains between 5.1 and 19 million tons of lithium, or about 35% to 136% of the current U.S. lithium resource estimate. Lithium boom baby!</span></p><p>If the U.S. is going to usher in a clean, renewable future, it‚Äôs going to need access to a lot more lithium ‚Äî the essential mineral for building EV batteries and other clean tech. And boy does it look like Arkansas has us covered. God blessed America. </p><p><em>Zhou et al in Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Here a porous, crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) with olefin linkages has been synthesized, structurally characterized and post-synthetically modified by the covalent attachment of amine initiators for producing polyamines within the pores.

But we‚Äôll still need technologies that capture and remove the CO2 that has and will continue to make its way out into the world. </p><p><span>Luckily, Cal Berkeley researchers have developed </span><strong>COF-999</strong><span>, a new porous, crystalline organic material that efficiently captures carbon dioxide directly from open air. The material functions like a specialized sponge made of a porous material, with tiny holes throughout. These pores are designed to selectively attract and trap carbon dioxide molecules from the air as it passes through. Then, when the material is gently heated, it releases the captured CO‚ÇÇ, allowing COF-999 to be reused for continuous carbon capture.</span></p><p>Someone like Terraform Industries or Valar Atomics can turn the CO‚ÇÇ into fuel, that fuel will be used to power planes, and those planes can keep sprinkling COF-999. Bad time to be carbon dioxide. Good time to be a human. </p><blockquote><p><em>Science Corporation, a leader in brain-computer interface (‚ÄúBCI‚Äù) technology, has announced the preliminary clinical trials results for its PRIMA retinal implant.

One thing I do know: I was blind but now I see.</em></p><p><span>Science (</span><em>the Corporation, not the field of study</em><span>) released very promising preliminary results from clinical trials of its PRIMA retinal implant. The PRIMA system is a wireless, autonomous implant that works with special glasses and a pocket processor to enhance visual clarity. Essentially the glasses capture an image and that image is transported to an implant in the patients eye that allows them a to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a version of that image.</span></p><p>The implant restored meaningful vision to individuals who had lost their central visual field, enabling them to read sequences of letters and even longer texts. After 12 months, patients showed an average improvement of 23 letters (4.6 lines) in visual acuity, with the best patient improving by 59 letters (11.8 lines). Meaning, the trial participants went from being blind to being able to read short passages.</p><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are going to get a lot better in the coming years. One day, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll all have some chip planted in our brains that makes us superhuman.

In my head it always goes back to flipbook animation. That‚Äôs the technique where sequential drawings on pages are flipped rapidly to create the illusion of motion. You likely made a flipbook animation in first grade. It was exhausting and shitty. So when I see animated films today, I always imagine a team of artists flipbooking their way through an intricate 2 hour long movie. Reader, that‚Äôs now how animation works today and it hasn‚Äôt worked this way in a long, long time. But if you‚Äôre like me and that‚Äôs your base-level understanding of animation than this new product from Runway is going to blow your mind.</p><p>Runway‚Äôs Act-One generates expressive character animations using only an actor's video and voice‚Äîno extra equipment required. By capturing the nuances of facial expressions and performances, Act-One translates real-life acting into digital characters, even when proportions differ from the source.</p><p><span>It‚Äôs always kinda funny in the animated movies when the character kind of resembles the actor (</span><em>although it‚Äôs even funnier when the character is totally different than the actor</em><span>.) Like Maui in </span><em>Moana. </em><span>The Rock was born to play Maui and Maui was likely created to be perfect for The Rock. This tech takes that connection to a whole other level and does so in a low-cost, no equipment way.</span></p><p><em><strong>From Anthropic: </strong></em><strong><span> </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/b79c9c01-79fa-4bbe-840b-1cefe1d06518?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Computer Use</a></strong></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1287aae5-4171-4854-9510-3af565963457?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ODaHJzOyVCQ"></a><p>Anthropic introduced a new capability called "computer use" for its Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model. Computer Use allows Claude to interact with computers in ways similar to human user. It can perform tasks like moving the cursor, clicking buttons, typing text, and switching between windows or applications. You know, things we mere mortals regularly do on computers. Claude is essentially interpreting screenshots to understand what's on the screen and to determine how to complete given tasks.</p><p>You don‚Äôt have to extrapolate the demo of computer use too many years down the line to see how a technology like this could be disruptive. The majority of knowledge work done today consists of interpreting information on a screen and then moving our cursor or making a few keystrokes based on that that information. AI models have been good at the interpretation part for a couple of years now, but computer use bridges the gap between interpretation and action in a real-world helpful way like no model has before. It‚Äôs a little clunky today and for most people the prompts needed to complete a simple task would take longer than actually just doing the task, but you can pretty easily imagine the future when much of the prompting is abstracted away and descendants of computer use are automating much of the knowledge economy‚Äôs work.</p><p><span>Fine by me: ‚ÄúHey computer use, please write and publish this week‚Äôs edition of the </span><em>Weekly Dose of Optimism</em><span>.‚Äù</span></p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><span>: After writing the above passage, Anthropic </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/124f673f-0a69-4c73-9e3d-366087ec7785?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">added another feature to Claude</a><span>: the ability to write and run code.
