Al-Jahiz's ideas on the struggle for existence in the Book of Animals have been summarized as follows:<br>"Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for resources, to avoid being eaten and to breed.

I find it interesting to see "Darwinian" theories expressed a millennium before Darwin. This post is of necessity a rather perfunctory summary of a complex subject, so feel free to add comments.  And see also "The Qur’an & Space Science" at The Turbid Blog.
