        <p><strong>Description:</strong> American Express has slowly been refreshing its card portfolio, introducing new benefits and increasing earning with cards like the American Express® Gold Card and the American Express® Business Gold Card. Most recently, the card issuer announced changes to the Business Platinum® Card from American Express, adding up to $200 in statement credits toward Dell purchases each year, and a yearlong membership to WeWork. These additional perks come with a higher annual fee: $595, up from $450.

If you’ve never heard of WeWork, it’s a rapidly growing real estate company that provides flexible office space with amenities, hip decor and events to entrepreneurs and startup companies around the world.

Until today, we did not know exactly what type of membership card holders would receive other than that WeWork and Amex claimed it was a benefit worth $2,700.

Amex has shared the details of the benefit, which you can now register for here. Note that this is not an ongoing benefit, and will only be valid for one year after you register.

Business Platinum card holders will receive 12 months of WeWork Platinum Global Access. Platinum Global Access is only available to Business Platinum card holders, meaning those without the card will not be able to purchase this type of membership.

What exactly do you get with Platinum Global Access? WeWork describes it as such:

Platinum Global Access includes access to WeWork’s 300+ locations around the world, during local business hours. This includes access to open workspace and premium amenities, including Wi-Fi, phone booths, and refreshments, like coffee, tea, and fruit water. Platinum Global Access members also get a dedicated member support team and invites to exclusive Platinum Global Access-only events.

When I started working at TPG in 2016, we were actually based in a WeWork in downtown Manhattan (oh, how things have changed). WeWorks generally have a common area with tables, couches and a kitchen — adjoining these areas are private offices that are rented out by individuals and companies. With Platinum Global Access, you’ll only have access to these common workspaces, not a private office.

This seems similar to WeWork’s basic “Hot Desk” option that starts at $220 a month — that’s likely where the $2,700 valuation comes in ($220 x 12 = $2,640). Although unlike other memberships, Platinum Global Access grants entry to all locations without any additional fee.

WeWork says that Platinum Global Access will only allow access to WeWork buildings during normal business hours, from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. While common spaces typically close at 6pm, Amex notes that office hours do vary by location so you may be able to spend more time there, especially if you’ve already entered the building. You’ll have access to conference rooms and printing, but you’ll have to purchase credits if you want to use either.

Finally, you can book a hot desk in advance, which can be done in as little as an hour ahead of time. Members can still swipe into a WeWork without advanced notice but there may be times when a location is at capacity, so booking ahead can help guarantee a space to work, an Amex representative told TPG.

When to Sign Up

You can sign up for the benefit here, and although the official launch date isn’t until Feb. 15, Amex confirmed with us that you can start using the offer immediately. Once enrolled, you’ll receive a welcome email from WeWork (two to three business days after signing up) which will notify you that you can start booking space at one of WeWork’s 425 locations around the globe.

Only primary card holders are eligible for the benefit, so any authorized users won’t be able to get a membership of their own.

Another important thing to consider is when to enroll. You’ll have to sign up by Dec. 31, 2019 — after that the benefit will no longer be available — but your yearlong membership will begin on whatever date you enroll. It may make sense to wait to sign up until you know when you’re actually going to start using WeWork.

In years past, TPG was actually based in a WeWork space in downtown Manhattan (oh, how things <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/05/reader-event-new-tpg-office-nyc/">have changed</a>).

You can register through the WeWork - Amex Business Platinum landing page:</p><div><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-23-at-5.25.25-PM.png?width=1080"></div></div><p>Once enrolled, you'll receive a welcome email from WeWork (two to three business days after signing up) which will notify you that you can start booking space at one of WeWork's 425 locations around the globe. Follow the instructions to create a WeWork account and then you can get started. Only primary cardholders are eligible for the benefit, so any authorized users won't be able to use the membership or get one of their own.</p><p>When you visit your first WeWork location after enrolling, just make sure you have your Amex Business Platinum and a photo ID. A WeWork team member will set up your keycard and help with any other needs.</p><h2>Maximizing your WeWork membership</h2><p>Taking advantage of your WeWork Platinum Global Access is as easy as swiping into a WeWork office, but there are a few ways you can make sure you're getting the most out of your membership.</p><h3>Know when to enroll</h3><p>Your year of complimentary access begins automatically on the day you enroll and there is no way for you to adjust that start date afterward. You are required to enroll by Dec. 31, 2019, but think about which months you'll find the benefit most useful. If you're planning to travel a lot for business within the next few months and will need an office on the road, you should enroll as soon as possible. However, if you won't really start using the membership until the new year, it's worth waiting to enroll (and setting a reminder so you don't forget) until closer to the end of the year so you can squeeze as much usage out of your access as possible.</p><h3>Download the app</h3><p>WeWork has an easy-to-use app where you can search for WeWork locations, book a hot desk or conference room and connect with other WeWork members. You can also view and RSVP to exclusive events, get exclusive member benefits and register guests. When you're traveling, you don't want to have to pull out your laptop to look up local WeWork locations, so the app is handy to have downloaded.</p><h3>Book ahead</h3><p>You can book a hot desk in advance, which can be done as little as an hour ahead of time. Members can swipe into a WeWork without advance notice but there may be times when a location is at capacity, so booking ahead can help guarantee a space to work, an Amex representative told TPG.</p><h3>Take advantage of amenities</h3><p>WeWork offers more than just a desk and a roof over your head. Many locations come with free Wi-Fi, phones and refreshments. Common areas can also have couches and other comfortable seating options. If your destination airport doesn't have a lounge that allows access for arrivals, you can essentially use a WeWork as a lounge. If there's a WeWork location nearby, chill out there before heading to your hotel or Airbnb instead of camping out at a restaurant or coffee shop until you can check in.</p><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2019/03/20180905_WeWork_Galaxy_-_Additional_Amenities_-_Pool-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400px&amp;quality=1&amp;width=1080#038;ssl=1"></div><figcaption>Some WeWork locations offer additional ameneties, such as rooftop pool access. (Photo courtesy of WeWork.)</figcaption></figure><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>This WeWork benefit is a lucrative addition to the Amex Business Platinum, a card that already provides an <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/reviews/amex-business-platinum-card-review/">impressive list of benefits</a>. If you're a current cardholder, make sure to enroll in this benefit before Dec. 31, 2019. For those who have been on the fence about the card, now is a great time to apply. You could earn up to 100,000 bonus points with the card's current welcome offer after spending $25,000 total on purchases in the first three months of cardmembership.</p><p><strong>Official application link: Apply for the Business Platinum Card from American Express to take advantage of its current 100,000-point welcome offer and WeWork membership benefit.</strong></p></div></p></div>
