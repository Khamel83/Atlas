        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Welcome to Nifty, Gifty Holidays, our guide for all the little, magical ways we make the season sparkle. Today, we’re tapping a professional gift stylist for tips on perfecting our present-wrapping game.

Do your presents end up wrapped in helplessly wrinkled paper and lopsided little bows? While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we can’t help but admit there’s something incredibly satisfying about handing over an impeccably wrapped gift during the holidays (and year-round!).

If you struggle to wrap presents each year—or just want to up your game to impress your friends and family—we’ve got a treat for you. Toronto-based gift stylist Corrina vanGerwen was kind enough to let us pick her brain about what it takes to create a showstopping gift, and her pro tips are pretty ingenious, if we do say so ourselves.

Here’s everything you need to know about picking wrapping paper, executing proper technique, embellishing gifts, and more.

Better Materials, Better Wrapping

As with any craft, you’ll have an easier time creating a beautiful present if you start out with high-quality materials. “Avoid paper that’s too thin, as it’s going to tear easily and just be frustrating,” explains vanGerwen. “Papers from dollar stores, for example, tend to rip, but that doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot.”

Some of her go-to places for quality wrapping materials include The Paper Place, Minted, and Paper Source. Personally, I’ve had great luck with wrapping paper from Target and The Container Store, too.

5 Tips to Better Wrapping

Once you’re armed with your wrapping paper, scissors and tape, it’s time to get to work. Here are vanGerwen’s top tips for an Insta-worthy present:

1. Measure Your Paper

There’s such a thing as too much wrapping paper—and too little. “Paper should be large enough to wrap around the box with a little bit of overlap, plus enough overhang on either side to cover the ends of the box,” explains vanGerwen. “Too much paper gets in the way and you end up with wrinkles and bulges; too little paper and, well, you can’t cover your box.”

2. Wrap It Tight!

For best results, make sure your wrapping paper is tight around the package. “It should be snug and lie flat to avoid unsightly creases, gaps and bubbles.” Personally, I find it helpful to tape the inner edge of the paper to the package so you can pull it taut as you wrap the paper around.

3. Fold Exposed Edges

This next tip is ingenious, so easy and effective: "Fold over exposed edges of paper, both along the seam at the back and at either end," says vanGerwen. "This hides crooked cuts for a cleaner look."

4. Keep It Crisp

Just like your French fries, the edges of your packages should be crisp. Our gift stylist recommends using your fingernail to create sharp, defined creases.

5. Hide the Tape

If you want to get really extra about your wrapping, you’re going to need some double-sided tape in your arsenal. This allows you to hide it inside, resulting in a super neat appearance. However, depending on what paper you use, double-sided tape might not stick well: “Note that double-sided tape won’t stick to some papers,” says vanGerwen, “in which case you should test both clear tape as well as invisible tape to find which one shows less.”

Little Embellishments Go a Long Way

Once your package is wrapped, it’s time to decorate. You can go with a traditional bow or combine it with another little decoration for an added touch of holiday spirit. “I like to add embellishments like bells, tree ornaments, and sprigs of greenery to make gifts festive,” says vanGerwen. Not great with ribbon? She also recommends using pretty washi tape to give your package a little extra pizazz—no bow needed.

Wrapping Awkward Shapes (Hint: Gift Bag Time)

Okay, but what about those awkwardly-shaped items that you just don’t know what to do with? “Just put it in a box or gift bag; there’s no need to frustrate yourself by trying to get paper around a weird shape.”

Gift bags can be an easy way out, but at the end of the day, sometimes they’re necessary—especially if you’re pressed for time. “Don't avoid gift bags because you think it’s lazy,” she says. “Wrapping should be fun, not frustrating.” With that holiday motto in mind, it’s time to create some beautiful presents!

Fold Exposed Edges</h3></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>If you did a hack job when cutting the wrapping paper off the roll, you’ll definitely want to hide those rough edges. "Fold over exposed edges of paper," says vanGerwen. "This hides crooked cuts for a cleaner look."</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>4. Keep It Crisp</h3></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Just like your French fries, the edges of your packages should be crisp. Our gift stylist recommends using your fingernail to create sharp, defined creases, but there are other tricks, as well. “If you have trouble getting a straight line, place a ruler on the paper and fold over it.”</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>5. Hide the Tape</h3></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>If you want to get really extra about your wrapping, you’re going to need some double-sided tape in your arsenal. This allows you to hide it inside, resulting in a super neat appearance. However, depending on what paper you use, double-sided tape might not stick well: “Note that double-sided tape won’t stick to some papers,” says vanGerwen, “in which case you should test both clear tape as well as invisible tape to find which one shows less.”</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Little Embellishments Go a Long Way</h2></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><img src="https://images.food52.com/mML-j3yFzZXKw5iL2abd3o7XYGo=/2d335de0-a3c0-4965-b83f-dfddd645b6db--silver_midnight_holiday-group-vanGerwen.jpg?w=1080&amp;q=75"><div><p>Photo by Corinna vanGerwen</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Once your package is wrapped, it’s time to decorate. “So they don’t fray, cut fabric ribbons on an angle using sharp scissors,” recommends vanGerwen. Not great with ribbon? Try using washi tape to give your package a little extra pizazz—no bow needed.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>You can also dress up packages using small, festive items. “<strong>My go-to embellishments at Christmas are bells, ornaments, and greenery. Candy and sweets are fun too</strong>,” she says. You can either tie these into your bow, tuck them under the ribbon, or simply tape them down.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Wrapping Awkward Shapes (Hint: Gift Bag Time)</h2></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><blockquote><div><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmYekB3Hy50/"><div><div><div>View post on Instagram</div></div></div></a></div><div> </div></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Okay, but what about those awkwardly-shaped items that you just don’t know what to do with? “Just put it in a box or gift bag; there’s no need to frustrate yourself by trying to get paper around a weird shape.”</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>If you’re anything like me, you probably keep gift bags from holidays past, and while this is a great way to be eco-friendly, vanGerwen says you should make sure supplies are still in good shape—otherwise they’ll just look messy. “Avoid torn tissue, wrinkled ribbons, and worn out gift bags.”</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2>Shipping Presents Like A Pro</h2></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>If you’re foregoing in-person present exchanges this year, you can keep the holiday spirit alive by shipping stunning gifts to your loved ones. Naturally, the key here is careful packaging. <strong>After you wrap the gift, nestle it into a box filled with packing peanuts, shredded paper, or bubble wrap</strong>. Personally, I like to reuse materials that come in packages from my online shopping habit.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>“Make sure you have enough padding so things don’t shift around too much,” explains vanGerwen. “So your bows don’t get smooshed, use cord instead or tie the ribbon in a knot instead of a bow.”</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><strong>She also says it can be fun to add a noisemaker into the box—such as a bell or loose candy—that will rattle around as the box is handled</strong>. It will certainly get your giftee excited to open the package!</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><em>What are your best tips for a well-wrapped present?
