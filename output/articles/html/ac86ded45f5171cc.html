        <blockquote>Muslim celebrities answer a surprisingly tricky question.

“Do I worship a moon god? Are you allowed to have sex during Ramadan? What is a Mosque, what do you guys really do in there?”

Muslim Americans, more often than not, find themselves having to address a wide range of questions and misconceptions about their faith.

“Am I planning to blow anything up? Why don’t Muslims denounce terrorism?”

By definition, a Muslim is someone who follows the Islamic religion. “That’s it. There’s no secret handshake, you don’t have to run through a gauntlet,” explains comedian Aman Ali.

There are 1.7 billion Muslims in the world. So what does it mean to be a Muslim? There isn’t just one answer.

This episode of The Secret Life of Muslims features Aman Ali, Wajahat Ali, Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, Reza Aslan, Negin Farsad, Mona Haydar, Maz Jobrani, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Zahra Noorbakhsh, Omar Regan, Sebastian Robins, Linda Sarsour, Layla Shaikley, Dena Takruri, and Iqbal Theba.</blockquote>
