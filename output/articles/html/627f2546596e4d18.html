    <div class="content"><p><div><p>In mid-January, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1918938D:US">  Genentech</a> started recruiting 200 patients to test whether one of its experimental drugs can tame <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis"> ulcerative colitis</a>, a painful, incurable type of inflammatory bowel disease. Until then, the compound had only been given during experiments to treat lung and skin disorders. Deciding whether to shift a drug for use against a different disease than originally intended often takes years of painstaking lab work, but the California biotech did it in just nine months. The difference: artificial intelligence, which the company says helped its researchers scan millions of possibilities to confirm the drug could be useful against diseases affecting the cells of the colon.</p><p>“It’s not like the human is not needed anymore,” says  Aviv Regev, a Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology computational biologist who took a leave from her academic work to run Genentech’s research and development. “But the human all of a sudden gets the superpower.”</p></div></p></div>
