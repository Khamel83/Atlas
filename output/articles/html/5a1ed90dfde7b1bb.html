TPG Contributor Lori Zaino highlights seven airports where you can take advantage of complimentary city tours, a special perk offered by airlines for passengers with especially long layovers. Because who wants to sit around in the airport all day anyway?

Have you ever been dreading a flight because of a long connection? These seven airports around the world offer a better way to pass the time — a free city tour, so you can get a taste of the place you’re passing through. Here’s what you need to know.

Incheon International Airport (ICN) in Seoul, South Korea

The Korean tourism board offers several free, guided tours of Seoul for passengers with a 5-24-hour layover. Reserve your tour ahead of time online, email transittour@airport.kr or visit the ticket desks on the third floor in front of Gates 25 or 29, or at desks 41 and 42 on the first floor between Gates 8 and 9.

Keep in mind these tours are first come, first serve and you’ll be able to choose between a one-hour, two-hour, three-hour, four-hour or five-hour version depending on how much time you have. Note that you may need to pay $10 for a non-Visa entry permit (depending on which country you’re from) and show travel documents (like your passport, along with arrival and departure boarding passes or e-tickets) when registering for the tour.

It’s also possible for passengers to do more than one tour if the length of your layover allows it.

Narita International Airport (NRT) in Tokyo, Japan

Tokyo’s tour program is slightly different. A volunteer guide will accompany you on public transportation your choice of three different three-hour guided tours:

Tour 1: A guided trip to the Narita-san Shinshō-ji Temple (pictured below), Narita-san Park and Omotesando Street

Tour 2: A guided tour of the Museum of Aeronautical Science

Tour 3: A guided nature walk through the Japanese countryside

Wouldn’t you rather visit Narita-san Shinshō-ji Temple instead of waiting around the airport? Image courtesy of Shutterstock.
Self-guided shopping-themed tours are also available, where you can hop on a shuttle bus and be dropped off at either Shisui Premium Outlets or AEON Mall Narita. Note that you are responsible for any transportation and entrance fee costs that may occur. Visit the Transit Tour Desks at Narita Airport, located in both Terminal 1 and 2, to book your adventure.

Istanbul Atatürk Airport (IST) in Turkey

Free city tours of Istanbul are available for international transit passengers flying with Turkish Airlines who have a layover of 6-24 hours. You don’t need to reserve your tour ahead of time — just head to the Hotel Desk in the International Arrivals Hall (after customs, next to Starbucks) at least 30 minutes before it starts.

The scheduled tours run everyday from 8:30am to 11:00am, from 9:00am to 3:00pm, from 9:00am to 6:00pm, from 12:00pm to 6:00pm and from 4:00pm to 9:00pm, so check to see which time works best for you.

Turkish Airlines suggests that you be ready for boarding at least one hour before your scheduled departure time, so please allow enough time to go through customs and passport control after the tour so you can get to your flight on time.

A typical Istanbul city tour includes at least the following stops and activities, although these may vary depending on the day and length of the tour you choose:

Departure from Istanbul Atatürk Airport

Breakfast

Blue Mosque

Hippodrome: German Fountain

Serpentine Column

Obelisk of Theodosius

Topkapi Palace

Lunch

Return to Istanbul Atatürk Airport

Additional stops for the longer tours include a trip to the Grand Covered Bazaar, Eyup Sultan Mosque & Square, the Byzantine City Walls, Dolmabahçe Palace, the Basilica Cistern, Galata Tower and the Hagia Sophia, among other popular attractions.

It’s exciting to note that the entire tour, whichever you choose, is completely free and covers all entrance fees and meals. The food consists of Ottoman cuisine — note that lunch menus offer a vegetarian option, however no other dietary or religious food options are available.

I recently went on this tour, even though it was just a few days following the failed military coup, and had a wonderful time — stay tuned for a full review of the tour, coming soon to TPG.

Doha International Airport (DOH) in Qatar

Those flying on Qatar Airways with a long layover in Doha can participate in a nearly three-hour free city tour that takes you to the Museum of Islamic Art, Katara Cultural Village, the Pearl-Qatar, and the Souq Waqif. You’ll have an English-speaking tour guide and receive a free bottle of water. To reserve your spot, visit the Doha City Tour desk on arrival — it’s located at the beginning of Concourse B between the Mont Blanc and WH Smith shops.

Note that each passenger can only take one of the tours, so choose wisely.

If you’ve got some time to kill at SIN, check out one of two free Singapore city tours: The Heritage Tour, which includes visits to Chinatown and Little India, if your layover is at least 5.5-hour long, or the City Sights Tour, which takes you to the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Financial Center, if your layover is more than six hours long. The best part: to take advantage of the free tour, you can be flying on any airline.

Drop your baggage off at the storage kiosk before the tour and register at the Free Singapore Tour booths located in the transit areas of Terminals 2 and 3 before you clear customs. If you land in Terminal 1, stay in the transit area and head to Terminal 2 for tour registration.
