He takes us on a journey through Moradoom, Igamor, and Evermore, before arriving at Luminspere, the Mountains of Knowledge with tools like the Axe of Satisfaction, Torch of Curiosity, and Oars of Consistency. </p><p><span>Utsav weaves together so many ideas so beautifully that you just need to </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/19933e72-df45-4f65-ad96-cb24b9aa8244?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">read it</a><span>, and then listen. Or listen, and then read it. </span></p><p><span>His one sentence takeaway: </span><strong>Consistency trumps everything.</strong></p><p>But there were a lot of good sentences. Here are a few of my favorites: </p><p>"The way to live an intellectually rich life is to focus on two things: Put ideas above sensations, and try to have more diverse ideas than the ones you already have."</p><p>On Epistemic Anxiety: "Accept that you don't know everything about everything and you don't need to have a point of view on everything... develop expertise in a few fields while trying to read as broadly as you can."</p><p>"Building worlds in fiction is a given, but building worlds in non-fiction is done a lot less."</p><p>"Write something which has meaning beyond the current moment. It has to go beyond the zeitgeist."</p><p>"All learning requires us to suffer an injury to our self-esteem."</p><p>Going forward, I plan on releasing a few of these per week. This week, I have three killer interviews lined up, and just brought on an editor so we can increase both the quality and the cadence. North Star: when thereâ€™s something really great written on the internet, you can expect to find its author in the Hyperlegible feed within a few days. </p><p><span>I likely wonâ€™t send you an email every time (still playing with that), but you can subscribe on </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/cf7d64a7-d5f3-4af3-89be-e1c70071e5a6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/cab57d5a-d2fe-42e1-a0f1-6cde4ee65cfe?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Spotify</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/006ed090-f316-415f-9201-2205f3312efb?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Apple Podcasts</a><span>, and I may send a weekly roundup on Sundays with all of the conversations in one place.

Iâ€™ve been using Readwise for years to support my newsletter, my curiosity, and now, this podcast. </span></p><p><span>I wanted to partner with Readwise specifically for a few reasons. One: I use it every day, multiple times a day. When I find an essay I love, I save it to Readwise, where I can highlight and annotate it to prep for either inclusion in essays or conversations on Hyperlegible. Two: Iâ€™m an investor in Readwise. Three: they partner with my favorite written-word-related podcasts, </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/fcf3a691-bd94-4ce4-b21b-7ad4d4bdf3a4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Founders</a><span> </span></em><span>and </span></p><p><span>And Four (and most importantly): when you go to </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/95029554-615a-4ed6-8675-36cb42c31ad9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">readwise.io/hyperlegible</a><span>, you can find all of the essays that we discuss on Hyperlegible in one place.
