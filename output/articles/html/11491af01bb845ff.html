Three of those ten drops happened in the end zone. Not so good. Despite the historic futility of his teammates, Barkley did a good job of acquitting himself on the field and off, and was seen on the sideline encouraging Bellamy about his mistake.

He also spoke up for his receivers after the game:

"We win as a team and we'll lose as a team," said Barkley, who insisted he never got frustrated with all the drops. "During the game, I don't get wrapped up in the emotions of all that negativity. I'm trying to keep guys going, keep the tempo pressed and one play at a time."

Perhaps something good will come of this for the Bears, like Matt Barkley becoming a viable backup QB, or their receiving group learning something about grit and character and blah blah blah instead of being emotionally scarred for life. But more likely, none of that will happen.

The Bears lost to the Titans 27-21.</blockquote>
