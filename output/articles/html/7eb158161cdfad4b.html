Best. Year. Ever. Notably, 4Q’24 revenue was the most in any quarter since ‘21. Much of this is thanks to…</p><pre><code><code>“Liability management and restructuring had an exceptional year with liability management among sponsor clients continuing to be a primary driver of activity. We believe our firm's extensive expertise and integrated approach to advising clients will drive continued success.”</code></code></pre><p>Key words there: “continued success.” The LME train ain’t stopping, y’all. Weinberg continued: </p><pre><code><code>“[L]ast year, we had a very strong year in restructuring. I think it was our second best year ever, and we continue to see activity level in that space to be very strong. And frankly, the business has changed a little bit and that it's not really just bankruptcies and restructuring companies. There is a lot of liability management that plays into it. And we've really structured ourselves so that we are talking to more clients about more critical aspects of their capital structure than ever before. So we see that the activity levels kind of stay up for quite some time.”</code></code></pre><p>“Very strong” activity in RX but he’s really talking about “activity levels” around LME. Great for EVR!

Our global restructuring business again ranked number one in announced restructurings globally and in the U.S. and again delivered record results surpassing 2023's prior record performance.”</code></code></pre><p>The future? Let’s just say Mr. Taubman’s an optimist:</p><pre><code><code>“As we look ahead, we expect the macro backdrop for primary fundraising to remain challenging in 2025, while the Private Capital Solutions business should continue to experience secular growth. In restructuring, we continue to believe we are in a multiyear cycle of elevated activity and liability management, and we expect 2025 to be another active year for our liability management team.”</code></code></pre><p>He continues:</p><pre><code><code>“It doesn't look as if rates are coming down nearly as fast as others, including myself had thought. It's a bit stubborn. On the long end, it doesn't appear as if the Fed is likely to be more connotated in the short-term. You have all of this economic uncertainty, tariffs, and the like, I imagine that the amount of pain or number of companies who find themselves wrong footed either to the different trade and tariff framework or technological change or consumer preference changes and the like, they're not going away.”</code></code></pre><p><span>You heard it here. </span><strong>President Trump</strong><span> is potentially good for restructuring business!</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/88e4af2a-1f95-4382-99bd-40e54a97f7fa?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_396,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67378713-1b77-4c85-8044-9197707cd541_480x270.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>*****</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/48aaf313-b22f-451b-8ae0-f85fcac56a62?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_370,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16e999f6-6314-4fd9-95b2-1c71415d9d2c_370x136.png"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Houlihan Lokey, Inc.

Interest rates remain elevated and we expect that to continue. What that nets for actual numbers depends on an awful lot of factors that are kind of beyond our ability to completely predict.”

*****

</code><span>“If you look at where interest rates are, the number of sick balance sheets out there as a result of rapidly increasing interest rates for a higher period of time than perhaps people would have anticipated or some would have hoped for is really contributing to just more of those sick balance sheets needing to be taken care of. And that manifests itself in various different ways. And as we look at it and we just look at the level of inquiry that we have, we continue to feel confident that we'll be higher for longer.”</span></code></pre><p>CFO, Lindsey Alley added: </p><pre><code>“So long as the M&amp;A markets are robust, it's just hard to grow the restructuring business unless you start to see pressure on interest rates in sort of higher versus pressure lower. I think we feel comfortable saying higher for longer. I don't think we're comfortable saying that potentially in this market could be incremental growth.

*****

Now, if the market changes, obviously, then you'll start to see pressure on M&amp;A and you'll see some upward pressure on Financial Restructuring. But in this current market condition, assuming that it continues to get better, we love the fact that we're not seeing restructuring revenue decline. We love the fact that they're holding where they are. And we think it's a kind of a heroic effort from the team to keep us flat in an increasing M&amp;A environment.”</code></pre><p>In other words, Houlihan eked out some better YOY performance but not by much.

I - look - we did have a very good year. The economy feels strong enough that, as of now, I don't see an event that would cause a major disruption. Of course, I have to also say that things are pretty volatile in and around the things like the government and things like that. So anything could happen. I would expect 2025 to be a year that looked a lot like 2024 as of now, and that's without any external events in the restructuring world.”</code></code></pre><p>And here’s a little tidbit from Mr. Moelis on if the depressed sponsor led M&amp;A environment is elevating restructuring:</p><pre><code><code>“On the creditor side, it's interesting, probably our biggest opening is a lot of our restructurings were company side or debtor side. It's where we do a lot. I mean, it's probably 70:30. And we're we are being much more active now on the private credit side and trying to get in on that side of the restructurings. Is your point like these companies couldn't sell so they're getting into trouble? I don't think that's the answer, because it's hard to sell a company that can't cover its debt. So I don't think M&amp;A truly covers restructuring. I think restructuring might be driven more by interest rates would just make the onerous debt obligations kind of come in quicker than they would have three or four years ago. But I don't think it's the M&amp;A that's driving it.”</code></code></pre><p>Well okay then.</p><p>*****</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/ca25c1e8-6365-401b-a42e-9a12dc826fa3?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde8b23ca-f9ab-4a7f-b506-0db51d6461a5_760x171.png"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Lazard, Inc.

As an illustration, there's over $3 trillion of unrealized value across 28,000 unsold companies in global buyout portfolios, and more than 40% of these investments are four years or older.

Well, the acquisition and integration of car washs requires some greenback and, well, this sucker accumulated a good chunk of debt.***** Like $653.9mm worth.

And by spot we mean a 12/31/24 maturity that the company, thanks in part to federal interest rate hikes, didn’t have the money to service (there’ve been forbearances — 24 of them).******* Toss in some unprofitable and off-market leases, labor shortages, increased wages (and hurricanes) and suddenly these things aren’t throwing off as much cash anymore. With softer discretionary spending, you can bet that the recurring revenue from car washs ain’t so recurring anymore.

Hmmm, food for the kids or UWC?</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>What’s hilarious about this is that all of the PE bros rushed into this scam at once. As everyone rolled up mom and pop car washes across the nation, competition got worse and worse. “</span><em>Over the past five years, upwards of 900 new car wash sites have opened annually across the United States.</em><span>” The lack of originality amongst the PE bros is next level. </span></p><p><span>You have to hand it to the bros, though: confronted with all of these issues they’ve been looking to better the business. Per the first day declaration of Chief Transformation Officer </span><strong>Kevin Nystrom</strong><span> of </span><strong>AlixPartners LLP</strong><span> (“AlixPartners”):</span></p><pre><code><code>“Recognizing these headwinds, Zips has diligently pursued a wide range of measures over the past two years to proactively address and mitigate the impact of these challenges. The Company successfully negotiated savings with its vendor partners and optimized on-site labor and consumable spend. Through implementation of the “ZipsMe 2.0” program in 2023, the Company enhanced and standardized the quality of car washes and service across all sites — establishing a national pricing model, investing in service location aesthetics, and leveraging improved and consistent cleaning chemicals. In 2024, Zips introduced (a) Project Refresh, an initiative focused on refurbishing certain existing sites to drive higher customer traffic, and (b) the Zips App, a mobile app designed to drive customer engagement and e-commerce capabilities and develop actionable insights into customer behavior. Targeted initiatives helped to reduce costs, improve customer retention, and drive increased conversion of Retail Wash customers to the UWC membership.”</code></code></pre><p>Who knew car washes could be so tech forward? </p><p>Of course, these initiatives didn’t do enough to bolster liquidity, address maturities or, more holistically, firm up the balance sheet. </p><p><span>But, to their credit (or discredit, depending upon your point of view), Atlantic Street Capital stepped up to the plate. Unfamiliar with the otherwise well known phrase “</span><em>good money after bad,</em><span>” it teed up $68mm of fresh equity from July ‘23 through March ‘24; it also issued a $30mm sponsor guaranty. The guaranty and $30mm of the equity were issued </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/7be51179-a100-40a1-9ee0-885591b467d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">in connection with a maturity extension</a><span> through December 31, 2024, the former of which could be triggered by a failure to adhere to certain refinancing milestones. Clearly these guys LOVVVE their car washes. </span></p><p><span>With those milestones in sight by end of summer ‘24 and no hope for a refinancing to follow, Zips hired a full slate of RX pros, including </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span>, </span><strong>Evercore Group LLC ($EVR)</strong><span>(the RX group, the private capital solutions group had attempted the refi), and AlixPartners. The board of managers of Zips also appointed two independent/disinterested managers and formed a special committee. Shortly thereafter Zips added </span><strong>Hilco Real Estate LLC</strong><span> to the mix to deal with the lease footprint. With its lineup in place, Zips engaged in the “unorthodox” eve-of-bankruptcy divestment of its operations in Orlando, Florida on February 4, 2024 (at 10x EBITDA to another PE sponsor, lol) and lined-up a sale of its St. Louis, Missouri operations (at 15x EBITDA, to be consummated while in BK). </span></p><p><span>Of course, there are lenders on the other side of the aforementioned debt and there’s an ad hoc group in these cases (made up of </span><strong>HPS Investment Partners</strong><span>, </span><strong>Brightwood Capital Advisors</strong><span>, </span><strong>PennantPark Investment Corp.</strong><span>) represented by </span><strong>Paul Hastings LLP</strong><span>. And, congrats to all involved because in the absence of an out-of-court solution, the debtors have obtained the support of 100% of the term lenders and their major preferred shareholders******** around a deleveraging transaction that will (a) shed $279mm of debt (by equitizing the term loans) + millions in lease obligations and bring in a much-needed influx of new capital in the form of take-back paper (including a $150mm holdco facility and a $225mm opco term loan facility) and a new $15mm RCF to fund go-forward operations. “</span><em><span>An expedited and orderly process—</span><strong>with the support and buy-in from the Company’s landlord constituency</strong><span>—will allow Zips to continue as a healthy going-concern and preserve nearly 1,800 jobs,</span></em><span>” Nystrom said (somewhat ominously — emphasis his, not ours).********* Notably, general unsecured claims and preferred equity holders are slated to get bupkis in these cases — a proposed disclosure statement and plan of reorganization are already on file. </span></p><p><span>To power these cases — and because the debtors only had $1mm of cash as of the petition date despite $303mm of TTM revenue — the debtors lined up an $82.5mm SOFR+7.25% PIK DIP from their existing secured lenders, $30mm of which is new money (agented by </span><strong>Brightwood Loan Services LLC</strong><span>)($20mm interim). It’s only a 1.75x roll-up and there are no other fees on the DIP. </span></p><p>The debtors hope to go effective no later than 70 days after the petition date. That’s what one might call the “zip in, zip out, and zip on” bankruptcy experience.**********</p><p><span>The debtors are represented by Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP (Joshua Sussberg,*********** Ross Fiedler, Lindsey Blumenthal, Kent Hayden, Richard Howell, Seth Sanders, Tiffani Chanroo) and Gray Reed (Jason Brookner) as legal counsel, AlixPartners LLP (Kevin Nystrom) as financial advisor and CTO, Evercore Group LLC (Daniel Aronson) as investment banker. An ad hoc group of term lenders is represented by </span><strong>Paul Hastings LLP</strong><span> (Justin Rawlins, Charles Persons, Robert Nussbaum, Matthew Friedrick) as legal counsel and </span><strong>Berkeley Research Group</strong><span> as financial advisor. </span></p><h5>*Looking at you, Big Lots Inc. and JOANN Inc. Even getting to a plan of liquidation has been uber dicey in a lot of recent cases. </h5><h5>**Mr. Califano, a Partner at Sidley &amp; Austin LLP (“Sidley”), is not, as far as we can tell, involved in these cases (though his firm is as counsel to the prefs); he is, however, a big fan of the Northern District of Texas, where a lot of his company-side representations just happen to file for bankruptcy. Sidley, much like Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, spent some time early last year in the District of New Jersey in the aftermath of the Judge Jones fiasco in the Southern District of Texas. It appears the dalliance with New Jersey was short-lived. Here we are nearly six weeks deep into ‘24 and we can count on zero hands how many notable cases have filed in New Jersey. </h5><h5>***And people say there’s such a thing as subscription fatigue. </h5><h5>****You’re low key welcome for the Valentine’s Day suggestion folks. Anyway, these guys actually developed their own Insta show called #carwashconvos featuring interviews with college football and basketball players. G-d bless “name, image and likeness” benefits for college athletes. We’re in the golden age of content, y’all. </h5><h5>*****These guys went on a spending spree, going from 185 locations in early ‘20 to 260 locations by the end of ‘22 — powered not just by PE dollars but by four different senior preferred equity raises. One cannot help but to think that this business was 100% a ZIRP creation with all kinds of money just searching under rocks for return. As of the petition date, the debtors have $299.8mm of total preferred equity outstanding between a senior first priority slug ($229mm) and a junior second priority slug ($70.8mm). </h5><h5>******The interest rate on the term loan hit 12% and in ‘23 the company had $87mm in interest expense. </h5><h5><span>*******Choice quote from the first day hearing out of counsel, Mr. Sussberg: “</span><em>I remember when we were engaged and the management team and the sponsor sent us over the documentation, and we saw 24 amendments to the credit agreement. I haven't been doing this that long. It's been 22, 23 years. I've never seen 24 amendments to the credit agreement. My first comment in this day and age with LME, liability management transactions, being all the vogue, I said, I don't think I need to look at your credit agreement. I am pretty sure that there is going to be zero flexibility after 24 amendments.</em><span>”</span></h5><h5>********As Mr. Sussberg made clear in his “very entertaining” presentation — Judge Larson’s words, not ours — the fulcrum security in these cases is undeniably the term loans. Recognizing that and unwilling to pony up some more cash, the prefs consented to these chapter 11 cases and their 🍩 treatment. They got some expenses paid for their trouble. </h5><h5><span>*********Man, Kirkland loves messing with landlords. Basically what Nystrom is saying here is that landlords ought to get bent and provide some concessions or else there’ll just have lease rejection claims entitled to zilch under the plan. Notably, there are two independent/disinterested managers here who are conducting an investigation of pre-petition conduct, particularly that of the debtors’ sponsor. We’re sure an official committee of unsecured creditors will have some things to say about that in an effort to find </span><em>some</em><span> source of recovery in these cases. </span></h5><h5>**********We pulled this language from a presentation Mr. Sussberg played in court. </h5><h5>***********Sadly there are no Zips locations in NY. Otherwise we would have heard all about Mr. Sussberg’s five-minute-or-less car wash experience. Spared. For once. He did, however, manage to drop a #humblebrag about his soon-to-be-collegiate-athlete son for, like … reasons. Can’t fault a proud dad though. </h5><h3>💩Correction💩</h3><p>In Sunday’s otherwise a$$-kicking paying-subscribers’-only briefing … </p><div><div><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/91abfca5-1663-4883-87df-e669171627d2?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><picture><source><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c6d985c-0a5c-4352-be75-ac03ec2d3eca_1024x683.jpeg"></source></picture></a></div><h4><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/91abfca5-1663-4883-87df-e669171627d2?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">💥What's the Deal(EO)?💥</a></h4><div>Feb 9</div><span>Read full story</span></div><p>… we wrote the following in the EW Scripps section: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>“SSP acquired </span><strong>ION Media Networks, Inc.</strong><span> in FY’21 from </span><strong>Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
