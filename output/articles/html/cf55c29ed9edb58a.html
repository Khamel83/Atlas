The debtors use the “2-1-1” spread, which measures the cost of two barrels of crude oil against the price of a barrel of diesel and the price of a barrel of gasoline.

As a reminder, that was </span><em>conventional</em><span> production. The absence of </span><em>renewable</em><span> production brought woes of its own. </span></p><p><span>The Federal government looks dimly upon those refiners unable to produce their assigned quota of renewables under the Federal RFS, or “renewable fuel standard” program (the “Program”). The Program requires refiners “</span><em>to blend a minimum amount of on-road transportation biofuels, such as gasoline mixtures that incorporate renewable products like ethanol,” </em><span>Bullock writes. Should refiners fail to produce the volumes required by the EPA, they will </span><em>“accrue monetary obligations payable to the federal government.” </em></p><p><span>The EPA sets renewable volumes annually, based on factors including </span><em>“current climate change policy” </em><span>and air quality. Uh oh: </span><em>“Just as Vertex and the rest of the private sector responded to the sharp increase in biofuel demand, so too did the EPA—the Agency saw the moment as an opportunity to increase the renewable volume obligations even more to encourage even faster adoption of renewable fuels.”</em><span> Never let a crisis go to waste, after all. The EPA demanded an additional 120mm gallons in ‘23, </span><em>“which required fuel refiners like Vertex to blend nearly 21 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2023 and 21.5 billion gallons in 2024.” </em><span>The debtors were unable to meet their obligations, as a result of which $72.5mm of</span><em> “monetary obligations payable to the federal government”</em><span> will</span><em> “accrue”</em><span> by Q1‘25. Ironically, even if the debtors </span><em>had</em><span> produced the required volumes, they would not have been as profitable as they’d hoped. Why not? Because the debtors were not the only ones to think of </span><em>“pivoting” </em><span>to biodiesel in ‘20; there’s now a supply glut. </span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Thus, in 2023, the Company faced a ‘perfect storm’ made up of the looming renewable volume obligations, a shell of a Hydrogen Facility, unstable crack spreads, and a surplus of renewable energy supply in the market. Simply put, the rich renewables market that the Company once projected and planned for was slipping away just as crack spreads more generally were compressing.” </em></p></blockquote><p><span>The debtors explored asset sales, including the renewable diesel segment at Mobile. </span><em>“No actionable transactions materialized,</em><span>” which is hardly surprising.</span></p><p><span>We mentioned Q2 earnings and the disastrous plunge in refinery gross profits. The debtors in their </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/535e14a2-679c-490d-85ea-244aad1784a3?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">press release</a><span> disclosed the </span><em>“continued safe operation</em><span>” of the refinery, but that was about it for the not-bad news. They reiterated the </span><em>“pause and pivot,”</em><span> and confirmed they are on-schedule for the conversion of the renewable diesel unit back to conventional production. </span></p><p><strong>CEO Benjamin P. Cowart</strong><span> said in the same release that the debtors were continuing to explore strategic options. He announced the appointment of Bullock as CRO. </span><em>“We believe that continued support from our lenders is key to executing our strategic priorities which are focused on managing our liquidity position.” </em></p><p><span>The lenders have been helpful. Over the summer of ‘24, the debtors and their advisors —A&amp;M, </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span> as legal counsel and </span><strong>Perella Weinberg Partners LP</strong><span> </span><strong>($PWP)</strong><span> as investment banker — sat down with an ad hoc group of term loan lenders represented by </span><strong>Sidley Austin LLP</strong><span> and </span><strong>Houlihan Lokey ($HLI).</strong><em> “It became clear that any viable path forward would require incremental liquidity,”</em><span> Bullock observes. A third-party lender under the existing term loan facility provided $20mm on July 24; the Consenting Lenders did their bit with a $25mm bridge on August 23, again under the pre-petition facility, as talks continued and the parties got their papers in order.

If parties do submit IOIs, they’ll then be required to submit a qualified bid by November 22, 2024. </p><blockquote><p><em>Pursuant to the proposed Bidding Procedures, if the Debtors receive one or more Indications of Interest for an actionable proposal, the Debtors will move swiftly toward an auction. </em></p></blockquote><p>If this plays out, a sale hearing would follow on December 16, 2024. </p><p>But what if said rock isn’t sheltering any interested parties? Well, the consenting lenders have an opportunity to submit a credit bid. Per the debtors: </p><blockquote><p><em>However, if the Debtors do not receive any Acceptable Indications of Interest for any of the Assets prior to the Indication of Interest Deadline, the Debtors may terminate the marketing process and cancel the Successful Bidder Sale Hearing. Moreover, to the extent the Consenting Term Loan Lenders submit a Credit Bid for all or a portion of the DIP Claims and/or Term Loan Claims (the “Credit Bid Sale”), the Debtors may pursue the accelerated timeline contemplated under the Bidding Procedures.</em></p></blockquote><p>Bullock provides the following illustration of the dual-track sale process:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1180f95f-c796-4984-a170-9e3adf3260ff?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2552,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05b66d20-0015-49e1-8e75-886160618e6a_1276x716.png"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 73-1</figcaption></figure></div><p>Honestly, it’s all kinda “weird” — a word that seems to be making the rounds these days. GUCs like Matheson, however, had better hope there’s a deep-pocketed buyer. The only way they get a recovery is if there’s “Excess Distributable Cash” from a sale that clears the DIP and term loan. </p><p><span>So what happens if there is no sale process? The debtors will pivot to a recapitalization transaction. This basically means that the term loan will be equitized. Bullock says, should the debtors choose the recapitalization, “</span><em>there are a number of key issues that they will need to address during this process.” </em><span>Top of the list is (i) the $72.3mm owed the Federal government under the Program, (ii) negotiating an amended intermediation facility and/or (iii) sourcing exit financing. You know what Matheson gets under this scenario? A big fat 🍩. At least the consenting lenders agreed to a wind-down reserve though to help get this sucker to a plan of liquidation! Magnanimous!! </span></p><p><span>There’s another component to the RSA that </span><em>is</em><span> a bit more definitive: a DIP credit facility. Indeed, the debtors seek to fund the cases via the use of their lenders’ cash collateral and a $280mm super-senior secured DIP facility committed to by the consenting lenders, comprising $80mm of new money term loans bearing interest at S+950bps and a roll-up of certain pre-petition loans. Of the new money, approximately $39.4mm will be available on an interim basis and $40.6m on a final basis. Regarding the roll-ups, $37.9mm of 2024-1 Term Loans will be rolled into the DIP facility on an interim basis. On entry of a final DIP order, $135.2mm of initial term loans or additional term loans (“restricted roll-up”) and $26.8mm of 2023 term loans (“final roll-up”) will roll up. All will be on a pari passu basis, with the initial and final roll-ups bearing interest of S+940bps and the restricted roll-ups S+960. The “Maximum Roll-Up Ratio” of DIP Roll-Up Loans to DIP New Money Loans will not be greater than 2.5:1 in the aggregate. The facility bears a 3% commitment fee and a 3% closing fee.</span></p><p><span>The debtors won interim approval of the DIP at the first day hearing held on September 25, 2024; they also received authorization for the use of an </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/57a226eb-be97-4828-85b1-8541780a1127?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">amended intermediation facility</a><span> and </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/14032c6f-fdf3-4563-956b-faa28aa046d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">amended hedging agreements</a><span> — both with </span><strong>Macquarie Bank Limited</strong><span> (“Macquarie”) –used to finance purchases of crude oil and feedstocks.
