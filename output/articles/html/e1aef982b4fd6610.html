Nevertheless,<br>prophets of doom might keep in mind that their darkest predictions have been,<br>on the whole, a little premature. In 1968, Paul Ehrlich, a lepidopterist, and<br>his largely uncredited wife, Anne, published a best-seller called “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPopulation-Explosion-Paul-R-Ehrlich%2Fdp%2F0671732943%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fcrid%3D1A7CE4RH0CNFZ%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6P9Y0jvIZPRoSjcxNrOthZfbGCLcPfqLHJGIwL8yD5PbUsolq5iU2JpcVgVwO37kOFZ2LUeJRBvgxlZqyAISaXiFbNm7FgMmoTGlz3Q8Ga0VgFBGcUyNfM7OMcFU4YpXtqzW2POXOGWU5kY1HVP_K91cRm47GmpnouprwPzB6z_UB2ewVhJSgb51WFruc_eQJVh1VVnIGE0kxGl22reN_fcDssoSL1kUXqKNb51LVJo.rEkvaEF7S-ZZNiX_jiYZE4EvYABxFLTRDOa72MOxls4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dthe%2520population%2520bomb%2520paul%2520ehrlich%26qid%3D1740174821%26sprefix%3DThe%2520Population%2520Bomb%2Caps%2C158%26sr%3D8-2"><span>The Population Bomb</span></a>.” For<br>centuries, economists had worried that the world’s food supply could not<br>possibly be expected to keep pace with the growing mobs of people. Now there<br>was no postponing our fate. “The battle to feed all of humanity is over,”<br>Ehrlich wrote. “In the 1970s the world will undergo famines—hundreds of<br>millions of people are going to starve to death.” This was the received wisdom<br>of the era: a decade earlier, an only slightly flippant article in <i>Science</i> estimated<br>that in November, 2026, the global population would approach infinity. Ehrlich<br>prescribed a few sane proposals—the legalization of abortion, investments in<br>contraception research, and sex education—but he also floated the idea of<br>spiking the water supply with temporary sterilants. Americans might protest<br>such extreme measures, he allowed, but people in foreign countries should have<br>no choice. It was only reasonable that food aid be conditioned on the<br>developing world’s ability to exhibit civilized restraint. Nations that<br>tolerated a free-for-all of unrepentant copulation—he singled out India—would<br>be left to fend for themselves.</span></p><br><br><p><span>“The Population Bomb” transformed regional unease into a<br>global panic. India, in less than two years, subjected millions of citizens to<br>compulsory sterilization. China rolled out a series of initiatives—culminating<br>in the infamous one-child policy—that included punitive fines, obligatory IUD<br>insertions, and unwanted abortions. Ehrlich can hardly be blamed for the most<br>coercive incarnations of population control. He might, however, be accused of<br>impeccable comic timing. By the time “The Population Bomb” was published, the<br>population-growth rate had already peaked. For hundreds of thousands of years,<br>we had gone forth and multiplied. This epoch was coming to an end.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The “total fertility rate” is a coarse estimate of the<br>number of children an average woman will bear. A population will be stable if<br>it reproduces at the “replacement rate,” or about 2.1 babies per mother. (The<br>.1 is the statistical laundering of great personal tragedy.) Anything above<br>that threshold will theoretically generate exponential expansion, and anything<br>below it will generate exponential decay. In 1960, the tiny country of<br>Singapore had a fertility rate of almost six. By 1985, it had been brought down<br>to 1.6—a rate that threatened to roughly halve its population in two<br>generations. As the economist Nicholas Eberstadt told me, “For two decades, the<br>leaders of Singapore said, ‘Oh, uncontrolled fertility has terribly dangerous<br>consequences, so the rate has to come down,’ and then, after a semicolon,<br>without even catching their breath, said, ‘Wait, I mean go up.’ ” The<br>nation’s leaders launched a promotional campaign: “Have-Three-or-More (if you<br>can afford it).” Singaporeans were known to be good national sports, but,<br>despite the catchiness of the slogan, they proved noncompliant. From one nation<br>to the next, the nightmare of too many descendants turned into the nightmare of<br>too few. In 2007, when Japan’s total fertility rate hit 1.3, a conservative government<br>minister referred to women as “birth-giving machines.” This didn’t go over<br>particularly well with anyone, including his wife.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Today, declining fertility is a near-universal phenomenon.<br>Albania, El Salvador, and Nepal, none of them affluent, are now below<br>replacement levels. Iran’s fertility rate is half of what it was thirty years<br>ago. Headlines about “Europe’s demographic winter” are commonplace. Giorgia<br>Meloni, the Prime Minister of Italy, has said that her country is “destined to<br>disappear.” One Japanese economist runs a conceptual clock that counts down to<br>his country’s final child: the current readout is January 5, 2720.</span></p><br><br><p><span>It will take a few years before we can be sure, but it’s<br>possible that 2023 saw the world as a whole slump beneath the replacement<br>threshold for the first time. There are a couple of places where fertility<br>remains higher—Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa—but even there the rates are<br>generally diminishing. Paranoia has ensued. In the past year, hundreds of men<br>in the Central African Republic have reported the presumably delusional belief<br>that their genitals have gone missing. In Nigeria, where the fertility rate has<br>fallen from seven to four, a widely read tabloid blamed a conspiracy of<br>perverts in the French intelligence services who had been “using secret<br>nanotechnology innovations to steal penises from African men in order to<br>reverse the extinction of Europeans unwilling to bear children.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The phenomenon exerts a peculiarly deranging force, and<br>until recently Americans remained oblivious. In the past two decades, however,<br>the American fertility rate has dropped roughly twenty per cent, to 1.6. The<br>right wing sees depopulation as a greater threat than climate change. Elon Musk<br>describes it as “the biggest danger civilization faces by far,” and is trying,<br>in his quiet way, to compensate on his own. He has sired, at least in a<br>technical sense, thirteenish known children, and has reportedly offered the<br>dispensation of his sperm to friends, employees, and people he met once at a<br>dinner party. (Musk denies this. Skeptics of the strategy, though, might recall<br>that <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F01%2F01%2Fempires-of-the-steppes-the-nomadic-tribes-who-shaped-civilization-kenneth-harl-book-review"><span>Genghis Khan</span></a>, according<br>to legend, had more than a thousand offspring.) Vice-President <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F11%2F04%2Fj-d-vance-profile"><span>J. D. Vance</span></a> has<br>blamed this “catastrophic problem” on the “childless left.” Liberals more often<br>dismiss the issue, not without reason, as scaremongering in service of the<br>Republican assault on reproductive rights. Some go further: a dwindling<br>population is a more environmentally sustainable one.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Anyone who offers a confident explanation of the situation<br>is probably wrong. Fertility connects perhaps the most significant decision any<br>individual might make with unanswerable questions about our collective fate, so<br>a theory of fertility is necessarily a theory of everything—gender, money,<br>politics, culture, evolution. Eberstadt told me, “The person who explains it<br>deserves to get a Nobel, not in economics but in literature.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The global population is projected to grow for about<br>another half century. Then it will contract. This is unprecedented. Almost<br>nothing else can be said with any certainty. Here and there, however, are<br>harbingers of potential futures. South Korea has a fertility rate of 0.7. This<br>is the lowest rate of any nation in the world. It may be the lowest in recorded<br>history. If that trajectory holds, each successive generation will be a third<br>the size of its predecessor. Every hundred contemporary Koreans of childbearing<br>age will produce, in total, about twelve grandchildren. The country is an<br>outlier, but it may not be one for long. As the Korean political analyst John<br>Lee told me, “We are the canary in the coal mine.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>In Seoul, an endless, futuristic sprawl of Samsung- and<br>LG-fabricated high-rises, an imminent shortage of people seems preposterous.<br>The capital city’s metropolitan area, home to twenty-six million citizens, or<br>about half of all South Koreans, is perhaps the most densely settled region in<br>the industrialized world. When I visited, in November, I was advised to<br>withdraw my phone from my pocket on the metro platform, because it would be<br>impossible to do so once on board the train. Fuchsia metro seats are reserved<br>for pregnant women. Those who aren’t yet showing are awarded special medallions<br>as proof of gestation. A looping instructional video reminded passengers of the<br>proper etiquette. Even amid the rush-hour crush, these seats were often left<br>vacant. They seemed to represent less a practical consideration than an act of<br>unanchored faith—like a place for Elijah at a Seder table.</span></p><br><br><p><i><span>“Stay . . .”</span></i></p><br><br><p><span>Cartoon<br>by Patrick McKelvie</span></p><br><br><p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p><br><br><p><span>Link copied</span></p><br><br><p><span>Shop</span></p><br><br><p><span>Portents of desolation are everywhere. Middle-aged Koreans<br>remember a time when children were plentiful. In 1970, a million Korean babies<br>were born. An average baby-boomer classroom had seventy or eighty pupils, and<br>schools were forced to divide their students into morning and afternoon shifts.<br>It is as though these people were residents of a different country. In 2023,<br>the number of births was just two hundred and thirty thousand. A baby-formula<br>brand has retooled itself to manufacture muscle-retention smoothies for the<br>elderly. About two hundred day-care facilities have been turned into nursing<br>homes, sometimes with the same directors, the same rubberized play floors, and<br>the same crayons. A rural school has been repurposed as a cat sanctuary. Every<br>Korean has heard that their population will ineluctably approach zero. Cho<br>Youngtae, a celebrity demographer at Seoul National University, said to me,<br>“Ask people on the street, ‘What is the Korean total fertility rate?’ and they<br>will know!” They often know to two decimal places. They have a celebrity<br>demographer.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Outside of Seoul, children are largely phantom presences.<br>There are a hundred and fifty-seven elementary schools that had no new<br>enrollees scheduled for 2023. That year, the seaside village of Iwon-myeon<br>recorded a single newborn. The entire town was garlanded with banners that<br>congratulated the parents by name “on the birth of their lovely baby angel.”<br>One village in Haenam, a county that encompasses the southern extremity of the<br>Korean peninsula, last registered a birth during the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Haenam disappears into the sea at a windswept cape called<br>Ttangkkeut, or “End of the World.” Not far away, there is a school that once<br>had more than a thousand elementary-age students. When I visited, in November,<br>it had five. A pastel rainbow brightened the façade, and out front was a statue<br>of a singlet-clad boy with a raised torch; the plinth’s inscription read<br>“Physical strength is national strength.” A pair of slippers had been left for<br>me at the entryway, beside a trophy case crowded with bygone glories and a<br>laminated poster that introduced the names and career aspirations of the three<br>first graders (policeman, architect, idol singer) and the two sixth graders<br>(truck driver, fighter pilot). In a memorable scene in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2006<br>film, “Children of Men,” a dystopian vision of a sterile world, a deer bounds<br>through a trash-strewn school hallway. Here, dereliction was kept at bay: the<br>corridors were bright, broom-swept, and freshly painted. The former chambers of<br>a departed principal, dusted as if in anticipation of parent conferences, were<br>spectral; the empty room next door had a hulking public-address console, with<br>five microphones set at varying heights. It was as if everyone had evaporated<br>overnight.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The school administrator, Lee Youngmi, efficiently if<br>warily welcomed me into a main office lined with spotless devices—a<br>spiral-binding machine, a laminator—and offered me ginger tea and cookies. When<br>she’d first arrived, ten years ago, there were sixty students. But the<br>surrounding town had since drained away. The large cattle market, which used to<br>be candlelit until well after dark, is gone, as are the brewery, the lumber<br>mill, the police station, and the post office. Parents fought to preserve the school<br>as a center of civic life, but their children now complained that there was no<br>one left to play with. Teachers called the current group of students, in a<br>reference to an old Korean superhero cartoon, the Eagle Five Brothers. Lee was<br>accustomed to solitude. When she left me in the room, she reflexively flicked<br>off the heating.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The sixth-grade teacher, Kang Wooyoung, a man in his<br>twenties, had a similar air of resignation. His two students had been together<br>since they reached school age. When I asked if they got along, he seemed<br>baffled by the question: they fought sometimes, sure, but they didn’t know any<br>other children their age. “The advantage is that I can be super intimate with<br>the students,” he said. “The disadvantage is that they cannot learn to<br>socialize in a group setting.” One of his sixth graders was disabled; a special-education<br>teacher was retained on his behalf, but the line item was hard to justify. The<br>patterns of the children’s lives were unlikely to be upended by the arrival of<br>a strange new kid or the torment of an unapproachable crush. The school may be<br>closing next year. Kang had loved his first teaching job, his own childhood<br>dream. But he didn’t have any friends in town, either.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The<br>after-school program was about to start. It featured two options: 3-D printing<br>and something Lee called “a new sport.” She could give me no details on the new<br>sport, which was played on Tuesdays. In the past, they had offered volleyball,<br>badminton, and soccer, but such extravagances required a critical mass. She let<br>me wander the school, which felt like a museum of childhood artifacts: an unlit<br>but well-stocked gymnasium, a darkened cafeteria outfitted with a little<br>proscenium stage, enormous forsaken playgrounds, ballfields gone wild. The only<br>apparent concession to the demographic reality was a robotic apparatus for<br>playing Ping-Pong by yourself.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The end of the world is usually dramatized as convulsive<br>and feverish, but population loss is an apocalypse on an installment plan. At<br>one point in “Children of Men,” the protagonist, played by Clive Owen, regards<br>a private archive of cultural treasures—Michelangelo’s “David,” Picasso’s<br>“Guernica”—and turns to its proprietor to say, “A hundred years from now there<br>won’t be one sad fuck to look at any of this. What keeps you going?” The man<br>responds, “I just don’t think about it.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Hysteria about the number of children is often an alibi for<br>hysteria about who is having them. In the first decades of the Roman Empire,<br>Augustus Caesar grew fixated on the decadent urban élite’s apparent refusal to<br>perpetuate itself. The patrician class, he said, was betraying the country “by<br>rendering her barren”; to deny their ancestors the immortality of their lineage<br>was an act “worse than murder.” In 9 <span>A.D.</span>,<br>he legislated that high-status men who remained single by the age of<br>twenty-five would forfeit their inheritances. In addition, the élites were<br>forbidden to marry actors. Their infertility probably owed less to dalliances<br>with thespians than it did to the presence of lead in their utensils,<br>cosmetics, and pipes. Either way, their biological legacies were in fact<br>extinguished: imperial Roman urbanites left little detectable genetic trace in<br>subsequent Europeans. The population as a whole, however, was fine.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Aside from the blips of the Mongol invasions, <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2005%2F03%2F21%2Fthe-end-of-the-world"><span>the Black Death</span></a>, and the<br>Thirty Years’ War, the human number in Eurasia grew steadily, if slowly, for<br>the bulk of the next two millennia. As the economist Thomas Malthus famously<br>observed, the only effective deterrent to the otherwise consuming “passion<br>between the sexes” was the fear that one’s children would starve to death.<br>Families were just large enough to compensate for the fact that nearly half of<br>all babies born would never celebrate their fifth birthday. In about 1805, we<br>crossed the threshold of a billion people. That had taken the entirety of human<br>history. Our next billion took just a hundred and twenty-three years.</span></p><br><br><p><span>This population explosion coincided, oddly, with a downward<br>fertility drift in Europe. The pioneers were French aristocrats: in the<br>interest of consolidating familial wealth and prestige, the nobility<br>increasingly delayed marriage, and then sought to limit the number of offspring<br>who might expect their share of an inheritance. This made sense. But the<br>practices diffused, through mimicry, to the lower orders. This made less sense.<br>Evolutionary imperatives, it seemed, could be eclipsed by cultural contagion.</span></p><br><br><p><span>By the twentieth century, more rational explanations had<br>caught up. An industrializing economy no longer required children to help on<br>the farm. Women were free to enter the workplace. At the same time,<br>improvements in medicine and sanitation radically reduced the rate of childhood<br>mortality. Children became capital assets, and investments in their education<br>were understood to beget healthy returns. Economists likened this to other<br>consumer durables: as families get richer, they don’t just keep buying cars; they<br>buy nicer ones.</span></p><br><br><p><span>If economic prosperity decreased fertility, it seemed<br>intuitive that lower fertility should, in turn, increase prosperity. During the<br>Cold War, population control came to be seen as a kind of master key—a panacea<br>for social and political ills. In a forthcoming book, “Toxic Demography,” the<br>scholar Jennifer Sciubba and her co-authors write that American élites believed<br>“population growth caused poverty, and poverty caused communism.” It was in the<br>best interests of the West, leaders such as President <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2019%2F01%2F28%2Fthe-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives"><span>Lyndon Johnson</span></a> affirmed,<br>to subsidize the proliferation of birth control and sex education. It was<br>unfortunate but apparently unavoidable that the principal instrument of family<br>planning was the female body. The president of <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2023%2F05%2F15%2Fthe-problem-with-planned-parenthood"><span>Planned Parenthood</span></a>, an<br>organization founded in alignment with the eugenicist sympathies of<br>early-twentieth-century progressive movements, warned that an overly precious<br>concern for “individual women” would impede progress: “We dare not lose sight<br>of our goals—to apply this method to large populations.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>South Korea stood at the vanguard. A decade after the<br>Korean War, the country’s per-capita G.D.P. was below a hundred dollars—less<br>than that of Haiti. People ate tree bark or boiled grass, and children begged<br>in the streets. After a military coup in 1961, the new authoritarian leadership<br>tied its economic program to the cultivation of a citizenry that was smaller<br>and better educated. It was an all-hands-on-deck approach to the labor force.<br>Social workers fanned out to rural communities, where they encouraged women to<br>have no more than three children. The government legalized contraceptives and<br>pressed for the use of IUDs. These initiatives dovetailed with an emphasis on<br>ethnic homogeneity and traditionalist values. Biracial children of American<br>servicemen, along with the children of unwed mothers, were shipped abroad for<br>adoption, and Korea became known as the world’s largest “exporter” of babies.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The program was regarded as a smashing success. In the span<br>of twenty years, Korea’s fertility rate went from six to replacement, a feat<br>described by Asian demographers as “one of the most spectacular and fastest<br>declines ever recorded.” A crucial part of this plan was the educational<br>advancement of women, which the same demographers called “unprecedented in the<br>recent history of the world.” Far fewer Koreans came into existence, but those<br>who did enjoyed a similarly improbable rise in their standard of living.<br>Parents who remembered hunger produced children who could afford cosmetic<br>surgery.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Fertility all of a sudden seemed like a knob that<br>governments could turn at will. It was simply assumed that the “demographic<br>transition”—the shift from many deaths and many babies to far fewer of<br>both—would settle naturally around the replacement rate. Like a restaurant at<br>capacity, our unconscious maître d’s would regulate our numbers on a one-in,<br>one-out basis. It never really occurred to anyone that governments might want<br>to turn the knob the other way.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Except, as a Dutch demographer once dryly put it, “the<br>drive in human populations to procreate may long have been over-estimated.”<br>When Korea neared replacement, in 1983, its leadership might have reconsidered<br>its policies. Instead, it doubled down with a new slogan: “Even two are too<br>many.” By 1986, the Korean fertility rate reached 1.6. This remained stable for<br>about a decade, then fell off a cliff. The government has now devoted<br>approximately two hundred and fifty billion dollars to various pro-natalist efforts,<br>including cash transfers and parental-leave extensions, to no avail. Two years<br>ago, the legendary feminist legal scholar Joan Williams was shown the most<br>recent Korean fertility data for a documentary. She drew her hands to her face<br>in open-mouthed shock—like Edvard Munch’s “Scream”—and the image instantly<br>became a meme.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Korea’s demographic collapse is mostly taken as a fait<br>accompli. As John Lee, the political analyst, put it, “They say South Korea<br>will be extinct in a hundred years. Who cares? We’ll all be dead by then.” The<br>causes routinely cited include the cost of housing and of child care—among the<br>highest in the world. Very little in Korean society seems to give young people<br>the impression that child rearing might be rewarding or delightful. I met a<br>stylish twentysomething news reporter at an airy, silent café in Seoul’s lively<br>Itaewon district. “People hate kids here,” she told me. “They see kids and say,<br>‘Ugh.’ ” This ambient resentment finds an outlet in disdain for mothers.<br>She said, “People call moms ‘bugs’ or ‘parasites.’ If your kids make a little<br>noise, someone will glare at you.” She had recently vacationed in Rome, where<br>adults drank at bars while their kids ran amok. She said, “Here, people would<br>say, ‘What the hell are you doing?’ ”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The<br>online responses to media accounts of the crisis tend to be aggressively<br>cynical: “Just wait, we can go lower than that,” or “You can’t just birth the<br>slaves.” The reporter said, “When I write about this, I think, Well, what would<br>change <i>my</i> mind? The answer is nothing. It’s the norm not to<br>want kids.” Like many Koreans, she dotes on her dog. Finding gifts in Seoul for<br>my two little soccer fanatics at home required deliberate planning—I schlepped<br>all over town looking for national-team jerseys in child’s sizes and had to<br>settle for black-market knockoffs—but there is a pet depot on practically every<br>block. Last year, strollers for dogs outsold those for babies. She said, “I’m<br>not saying people value dogs more than they value children.” She paused to<br>gesture to the other patrons: “But all you have to do is look around.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>American conservatives have become preoccupied with<br>foreshadowings of “civilizational suicide.” A year ago, the <i>Times</i> columnist<br>Ross Douthat, a father of five, published an opinion piece that invoked the<br>Korean example as a “warning about what’s possible for us.” America’s birth<br>rate started to slip in 2008, with the onset of the financial crisis; by 2022,<br>the U.S. had caught up, or perhaps caught down, with the Korea of the<br>nineteen-eighties. Douthat and others see worrisome parallels here: marriage<br>rates are in retreat; gender polarization is rising; young people aren’t even<br>having sex for fun, let alone productively; the meritocracy is a grind; we’re<br>all rotting in front of our phones. Douthat has been circumspect about the<br>issue in a way that <span>MAGA</span> Republicans<br>are not. The Trump Administration’s new Transportation Secretary has already<br>instructed his department to prioritize “communities with marriage and birth<br>rates higher than the national average.” As the young right-wing activist<br>Charlie Kirk put it last summer, “The childless are the ones that are<br>destroying the country.”</span></p><br><br><p><i><span>“I’m just spitballing, but it might be fun if your next<br>play was about a lone skull making his way in the big city.”</span></i></p><br><br><p><span>Cartoon<br>by Chris Gural</span></p><br><br><p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p><br><br><p><span>Link copied</span></p><br><br><p><span>Shop</span></p><br><br><p><span>A childless vacuum, by this account, is the future liberals<br>want. Kirk’s conservative compatriots point to such examples as the young<br>progressive activist David Hogg, who once tweeted that he would “much rather<br>own a Porsche and have a Portuguese water dog and golden doodle” than have<br>children. “Long term it’s cheaper, better for the environment and will never<br>tell you that it hates you or ask you to pay for college.” These liberal<br>caricatures perceive family commitments as a drag on “self-actualization,” which<br>often becomes an excuse for hedonism. Conservatives instead call for a<br>rehabilitation of family values. The “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpersons-of-interest%2Fthe-rise-and-fall-of-the-trad-wife"><span>trad wives</span></a>” of social<br>media make cornflakes from scratch and would never let their husbands milk the<br>cows. As the self-described “domestic extremist” Peachy Keenan has put it, “The<br>home with the mom and dad is the little factory to produce the future, like,<br>literally.” Others have reached for more nefarious explanations for languishing<br>birth rates. <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F11%2F11%2Fthe-tucker-carlson-road-show"><span>Tucker Carlson</span></a> made<br>a documentary about “collapsing testosterone levels” in America; a far-right<br>influencer known as Raw Egg Nationalist blames endocrine disruptors in perfume.<br>There is no evidence, however, that the epidemic is one of infecundity. It may<br>be wishful to think so: it’s easier to avoid leaden dishware than it is to<br>reinvigorate a society’s desire for children.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The narrative of moral decay also sits uneasily with the<br>underlying data. In 2011, forty-five per cent of American pregnancies were<br>unplanned. This has come down dramatically, in large part owing to an<br>astonishing reduction in the incidence of teen-age pregnancy. Fresh-faced<br>“trad” milkmaids, for their part, do not seem to have more children. Where<br>female professional ambition once tracked with smaller families, this is no<br>longer the case: in Tunisia and in southern India, where women make up a very<br>small fraction of the labor market, fertility has dropped below replacement.<br>Recent research indicates that fertility rates now trend higher in countries<br>where more women work. In America, the decline cuts across demographic groups.<br>Even <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2020%2F03%2F30%2Fhow-joseph-smith-and-the-early-mormons-challenged-american-democracy"><span>Mormons</span></a> are barely<br>replacing themselves.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Carlson has accused liberals of a plan to replace<br>native-born Americans with immigrants. Even if this were true, it might not be<br>the most provident strategy. Studies have shown that newcomers from<br>high-fertility countries tend to adopt the reproductive customs of their host<br>nation within a generation. Hispanic women account for a large share of<br>America’s recent fertility decline. Only two communities appear to be<br>maintaining very high fertility: ultra-Orthodox Jews and some Anabaptist sects.<br>The economist Robin Hanson’s back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that<br>twenty-third-century America will be dominated by three hundred million Amish<br>people. The likeliest version of the Great Replacement will see a countryside<br>dotted everywhere with handsome barns.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Fertility decline is a polarizing issue in Korea. Lee<br>Jun-seok, a thirty-nine-year-old Harvard graduate who is sometimes compared to<br>J. D. Vance, is the most popular conservative politician of his<br>generation. We met late one Friday evening for beer and <i>soju</i>, and<br>our conversation was interrupted every five minutes by drunk revellers who<br>bowed deeply to him and took selfies. In the 2022 Korean Presidential race, Lee<br>helped mobilize disaffected young men to turn out in support of the<br>conservative candidate, who promised to abolish the gender ministry, which<br>coördinates the country’s equity policies. His victory, in what some observers<br>called the “incel election,” prefigured Trump’s triumph last year. Lee told me,<br>“When many women get to thirty-five, they start bitching about being duped by<br>the feminists who told them they could have it all. It’s literally impossible<br>for them to meet someone with the same socioeconomic status at that point, so<br>they have to degrade themselves. Now half of us are unmarried, and I’m part of<br>that.” When I asked about his American analogue, he said, “J. D. Vance<br>should not have been talking in a way that stereotyped people.” He paused, then<br>continued, “Although in Korea there’s more of a reality of childless cat<br>ladies.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>If Koreans aren’t reproducing, it’s not for lack of<br>traditionalism. Their culture, as one pro-natalist told me, is already “based.”<br>Pornography and sex work are illegal, and abortion was decriminalized only a<br>few years ago. A negligible proportion of Korean babies are born out of<br>wedlock. Korean men don’t do much at home, and those who do are often branded “<i>pongpongnam</i>,”<br>a reference to dish soap that means “foamy man.” Paternity leave remains<br>relatively rare, and men who take it are called “latte papas,” as if they’re<br>using the leave as a vacation. Women fear they are assigned low-level<br>professional tasks in anticipation of their departure from the labor force. As<br>Kim Jeongmin, the editorial director of the news organization Korea Pro, told<br>me, “In H.R. interviews, women feel pressured to show that they’re so dedicated<br>to their careers that they have no plans to get married.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The insinuation that women are at fault for the demographic<br>crisis has turned gender friction into gender war. In 2016, the Korean<br>government issued a “birth map,” in which, as one blogger put it, “They counted<br>fertile women like they counted the number of livestock.” A conservative member<br>of the National Assembly recruited his own chorus line to demonstrate a novel<br>dance move he thought might help strengthen women’s pelvic floors. Many young<br>women now flirt with the “4B” mentality, a term for those who eschew dating,<br>sex, marriage, and children; some even forgo friendships with men. Yeho, a<br>nineteen-year-old sophomore at a prominent women’s college in Seoul, described<br>the routine misogyny of her male classmates in high school: boys habitually<br>recited lines they’d heard in porn, or illegally circulated pornographic memes.</span></p><br><br><p><span>She had no interest in dating or children. She told me,<br>“They might not grow up well, or they might fall into an incel community—and,<br>besides, children aren’t a necessary part of the good life.” Women in her<br>mother’s generation often regretted the sacrifices they had been expected to<br>make, and they raised their daughters to prioritize their careers. Yeho’s<br>college has an anonymous Reddit-like forum. The basic ground rule, she said,<br>was that “to give space to feeling good about men and relationships is to ignore<br>or minimize the dark side. Posts about heterosexual romance require a trigger<br>warning!” The most common such advisory is a derogatory portmanteau of the<br>words “love” and “hate.” In one typical reply, a woman wrote, “Can you please<br>stop posting about dating, it’s secondhand embarrassment? Your dick-to-ride-on<br>is not special at all, seriously.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Iasked around in Seoul about where I might encounter<br>children in the wild, and was directed to Daechi-dong, an affluent neighborhood<br>notorious for its gated high-rise fortresses, luxury S.U.V.s, and after-school<br>academies, or <i>hagwons</i>. These institutions have names such as<br>Groton, Swaton International, and Emilton Academy, and each has its own faux<br>heraldry. The most privileged students spend their afternoons, evenings, and<br>weekends at as many as a dozen different <i>hagwons</i>. Eighty per cent<br>of Korean families purchase private education; poor families tend to spend as<br>much on <i>hagwons</i> as on groceries. Aggregate spending on<br>educational enrichment exceeds the R. &amp; D. expenditures of Samsung, a<br>conglomerate that makes up a fifth of the entire Korean economy. At school<br>dismissal, students climb into yellow buses that ferry them from one <i>hagwon</i> to<br>the next. Through the plate-glass window of a building stacked with <i>hagwons</i>,<br>I could see an orderly queue of elementary schoolers—so colorful, so<br>small—awaiting their turn in the elevator.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Koreans cite the pressures and costs of excessive education<br>as a large part of their reluctance to have children. (American parents in<br>liberal enclaves might share a version of these misgivings.) An auspicious<br>Korean childhood culminates in acceptance to one of Seoul’s three most<br>prestigious universities. Admission is primarily based on a student’s<br>performance on the national collegiate entrance exam, or Suneung, which is<br>administered every year on a Thursday in November. The opening of the stock<br>market is delayed that day, and many construction sites are closed. Bus and<br>metro services are increased to ease traffic congestion. Students running late<br>may avail themselves of a police-motorcycle escort. During the<br>English-comprehension section, which requires absolute silence, air-traffic<br>control suspends all takeoffs and landings.</span></p><br><br><p><span>At some <i>hagwons</i>, fifth graders learn calculus.<br>Elementary students take pre-med courses. Some focus on sports or musical<br>instruments. There’s a Korean saying that “a dragon emerges from a small<br>stream”—that talent can be identified and nurtured in any backwater. But the<br>political analyst John Lee, who was once a <i>hagwon</i> instructor,<br>was dubious about this meritocratic ideal: “I was given a score range for<br>students. If I gave a score that was too high, the parents would think that<br>their children should be at a ‘better’ <i>hagwon</i>. If I gave a score<br>that was too low, the parents would think, This is wasting my money, it’s not<br>working.” Some <i>hagwons</i> are extremely selective. As one young<br>woman said, “If you don’t go to a certain one, you’re not part of the group.”<br>Historically, at the strictest cram schools, social interactions were carefully<br>circumscribed. Some forbade any conversation between boys and girls that were<br>not directly related to study. Hugging, or the exchange of romantic notes,<br>might have resulted in bathroom-cleaning duty.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Four out of five children in Korea today describe school as<br>a “battlefield.” In 2012, the advocacy group World Without Worries About<br>Private Education helped develop an ad campaign that showed a baby bottle full<br>of fried rice, with a caption that read, “Mom! It’s too early for me.” Curfew<br>laws prohibit <i>hagwon</i> classes after about 10 or 11 <span>p.m</span>. The issue nonetheless remains a<br>society-wide prisoner’s dilemma, and even those who strenuously object in<br>principle frequently relent in practice. When I visited the advocacy group, one<br>employee told me, “In the macro, everyone understands it’s a problem, but in<br>the micro, for <i>my</i> family, and <i>my</i> kids, I have<br>to do it.” When I commented that the children must be miserable, he corrected<br>me: “If you don’t send them, the kids feel bad! That’s the only place they can<br>see their friends, because no one is at the playground.” The leading cause of death<br>among young Koreans is suicide. More than one Korean described their culture to<br>me as “broken.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>It is<br>not easy to opt out of the system. One morning, I met with half a dozen members<br>of an unorthodox day-care collective in a neighborhood called Hapjeong. This<br>patch of Seoul, they told me, was distinctive for its lack of chain stores, and<br>they convened at an otherwise empty local bakery; it was next to a Starbucks,<br>across the street from two other Starbucks, and catty-corner from a fourth<br>Starbucks. Forty years ago, Seoul had practically no child care. Some working<br>parents locked their children in their apartments and hoped for the best.<br>Children died in house fires. In 2002, a group of grassroots organizers formed<br>this communal alternative.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The current parents were nostalgic for their own alleyway<br>childhoods. An artist named Daum told me that, when he was young, “if you<br>kicked a ball into someone else’s property, you went and rang the doorbell and<br>got it back.” That city no longer existed: “Now you get yelled at—‘You could’ve<br>broken my window!’ ” There’s a special word for noise between floors.<br>Complaints forced Daum and his wife, Dani, to leave their previous building;<br>one neighbor said, “I can’t stand your children anymore!”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The day care took the kids outside every day. They learned<br>about plants and animals, and were taught to mark the seasons with the old<br>festival days. The use of standard honorifics was discouraged, and children<br>spoke to teachers in “half speak,” the register ordinarily reserved for<br>informal address. The parents agreed not to send their children to <i>hagwons</i> for<br>the time being. This ethic of mutual care had made parenting “less scary,” one<br>mother remarked. Still, when their children aged out, they would be fed to the<br>educational machine. Another mother said, “When they get to normal elementary<br>school, the other little kids are already accustomed to a full-day<br>schedule—they have more stamina, they’re used to <i>hagwons</i>—but these<br>kids are still used to nap time.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Hwang Ock-kyeung, the president of a government-sponsored<br>think tank, told me that changes in policy can’t mend a culture that<br>marginalizes children. “My own employees tell me their babies look alien to<br>them,” she said. “Young people want the government to increase the child-care<br>hours, but then the time people spend with their children decreases!” An<br>obsession with social status turns children into tokens of parental<br>achievement: “Many parents take the subsidies and spend more money on<br>extra <i>hagwons</i>, and that becomes a vicious cycle.” Enhanced<br>professional productivity for parents, and the ability to enjoy one’s free<br>time, were not just collateral benefits. She added, “There’s a reason that if<br>you go to Daechi-dong you’ll see <i>hagwons</i> and Pilates in the<br>same building.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Just before Christmas, when a viral tweet announced a<br>record low for American fertility, some liberals blew confetti. One young woman<br>was retweeted twenty-six thousand times for writing, “Amazing keep it up<br>everybody!!!!!!” A comedian urged her followers to “<span>HOLD THE LINE</span>!!!!!” Last year, the philosopher Anastasia<br>Berg and the editor Rachel Wiseman, who seem otherwise unimpeachably<br>progressive, published a book called “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhat-Are-Children-Ambivalence-Choice%2Fdp%2F1250276136%2Fref%3Dtmm_hrd_swatch_0%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26dib_tag%3Dse%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qEfy7_uMyLICL7RkL8CqSc4hW5OmTJxe6mNgh6FtdfUWM_yT2Fev6wb2fD_5SbqiXQJKE5pFKiSmeoTwOV0E_lqU5aKwHYOOUDDY9viHNjICxQl561plT8X2CZtjjl3hL85c6859-SZjmPPf5kKL5zQK06oy43yYX74N5_QDiiToUAZ8Sm_IofmmOX5oYo7pB7SwJGZ47rPWJsuekvwCPk_VwFRizEB_4QxckgK3ZqA.vRuYpfyM6gRGU2DW9vbFD8k4vvEvqLZgmglVy5bu3_Q%26qid%3D1740175308%26sr%3D8-1"><span>What Are Children For?</span></a>”<br>It builds to a thoughtful, nuanced, heavily qualified endorsement of<br>childbearing as kinda nice. In a scathing review, the writer Moira Donegan<br>observed that ambivalent American women do not lack for such counsel. Any<br>leftist who feels the need to emphasize that babies are good, Donegan argues,<br>might not be a leftist after all: “It may be that on some level, perhaps not<br>always a conscious one, the millennial pro-natalists are trying to convince<br>American women that the freedom they lost with Roe v. Wade was not worth<br>having.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Given the stakes for reproductive autonomy, Donegan’s<br>reservations are entirely comprehensible. Most left-leaning Americans are<br>similarly distrustful of the pro-natalist discourse. Leigh Senderowicz, a<br>feminist demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told me, “There is<br>fundamentally no way to do this that doesn’t end up treating women’s bodies as<br>a tool.” According to the U.N., countries with pro-natalist policies tend to be<br>less democratic. A baby-bonus initiative in Italy’s Piedmont region was given a<br>name and logo that seemed an awful lot like an homage to Fascism. Eberstadt,<br>the economist, told me, “In China, the mechanics are in place to say, ‘Oh, I’m<br>sorry, Miss Wong, you can’t fly on airplanes anymore, because you’re<br>unmarried.’ ” Local Party officials are already knocking on doors to track<br>menstrual cycles. The Russian government recently passed a law that<br>criminalizes “child-free propaganda,” potentially including the representation<br>of a happily childless couple on television or social media.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Some progressives seem fine with child-free propaganda. The<br>BirthStrike Movement proclaims that “not having children is the single most<br>impactful decision that a person can make to reverse climate change.” This<br>might seem sensible, but depopulation will happen far too slowly to alleviate<br>the worst effects of climate change. The children who would have traded their<br>own existence for a cooler planet have already been born. In “What Are Children<br>For?,” <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Ffault-lines%2Fhow-liberals-talk-about-children"><span>Berg and Wiseman</span></a> suggest<br>that such environmental logic provides a cloak of moral legitimacy for personal<br>preferences that feel otherwise difficult to articulate. One scholar called<br>this the “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F09644016.2021.1902700"><span>socio-political weaponization of<br>fertility</span></a>.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Liberals are right to point to immigration as the obvious<br>way to mitigate the economic effects of demographic contraction. Italy<br>currently has a shortage of nurses, and Germany has a shortage of plumbers; a<br>baby born today does nothing to unclog a Düsseldorf sink. Even immigration,<br>however, is a stopgap measure: by 2100, ninety-seven per cent of the world’s<br>countries are predicted to be below replacement. In the meantime,<br>pro-immigration policies will continue to generate nativist backlashes. Last<br>year, Seoul sponsored a pilot program to import a hundred nannies from the<br>Philippines. The project, despite its lack of ambition, was wildly<br>controversial. This was perhaps unsurprising: Korean women have been known to<br>berate their Vietnamese daughters-in-law for peeling apples in the wrong<br>direction. American liberals are quick to associate the fear of cultural<br>corrosion with xenophobia. But Korea was long a vassal state of China, and then<br>a Japanese colony, so the question of civilizational survival has a slightly<br>different valence there than it does here. And even liberals tend to get<br>understandably sentimental about, say, the loss of linguistic diversity. The<br>Finnish demographer Anna Rotkirch pointed out to me that fewer than ten<br>thousand babies were born in Estonia last year. “What will happen to the<br>Estonian language?” she asked. “Seriously, this is not a far-off thing!”</span></p><br><br><p><i><span>“My productivity apps weren’t working, so I hired a goon.”</span></i></p><br><br><p><span>Cartoon<br>by Emily Flake</span></p><br><br><p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p><br><br><p><span>Link copied</span></p><br><br><p><span>Shop</span></p><br><br><p><span>The most sophisticated liberal arguments interpret<br>fertility decline as a symptom of more serious underlying problems—economic<br>precarity and an “incomplete” gender revolution. Men and women alike struggle<br>to provide for their families, but the participation of fathers at home has not<br>caught up to the participation of mothers at work. A more generous welfare<br>state, and a more equitable culture, should therefore produce more children.<br>This does not seem to be the case. Finland famously provides all new parents<br>with “baby boxes” full of useful, high-quality products, and Sweden has normalized<br>extended parental leave, especially for fathers, and flexible work hours. The<br>Nordic countries are wonderful places to be parents, but their fertility rates<br>are lower than our own. These trends are not reducible to budgetary concerns.<br>Child care is virtually free in Vienna and extremely expensive in Zurich, but<br>the Austrians and the Swiss have the same fertility rate.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The incidence of childlessness among Democrats is<br>significantly higher than it is among Republicans. This appears in part to be<br>an artifact of educational polarization. Lower fertility rates seem correlated<br>with the perception that proper child development depends upon enormous amounts<br>of personal attention. Some economists attribute our recent fertility slide to<br>a generational shift: people who were born in the nineties are less likely to<br>remember a time when children were largely left alone. Working mothers today<br>devote more time to active child care than stay-at-home mothers did in previous<br>generations. Mothers with a college degree spend about four more hours per week<br>with their children than mothers without one, and they are also less likely to<br>live in proximity to extended family. In an economy biased in favor of highly<br>skilled employees, a protracted education followed by a long career<br>apprenticeship seems like the only way to secure a dependable income. But the<br>longer people wait to try to form a family, the less likely they are to have<br>one.</span></p><br><br><p><span>We all<br>might agree that everyone deserves the financial security to afford the number<br>of children they desire. The word “afford,” however, means different things to<br>different people, and in the coastal precincts of “achievement culture” it has<br>been inflated to encompass individual bedrooms, piano lessons, travel lacrosse<br>teams, Russian math, and single-origin organic peanut butter.</span></p><br><br><p><span>For most of human history, having children was something<br>the majority of people simply did without thinking too much about it. Now it is<br>one competing alternative among many. The only overarching explanation for the<br>global fertility decline is that once childbearing is no longer seen as<br>something special—as an obligation to God, to one’s ancestors, or to the<br>future—people will do less of it. It is misogynistic to equate reproductive<br>autonomy with self-indulgence, and child-free people often devote themselves to<br>loving, conscientious caretaking. At the same time, we should be able to<br>acknowledge that there is something slightly discomforting about a world view<br>that weighs children against expensive dinners or vacations to Venice—as<br>matters of mere preference in a logic of consumption.</span></p><br><br><p><span>In the southern city of Gangjin, I stopped at a coffee shop<br>and encountered a sign on the entrance that read “This is a no-kids zone. The<br>child is not at fault. The problem is the parents who do not take care of the<br>child.” The doors of Korean establishments are frequently emblazoned with such<br>prohibitions. The only children I saw on Seoul’s public transit were<br>foreigners. Kim Kyu-jin, who is by all accounts part of Korea’s first openly<br>lesbian couple with a child, told me, “Five years ago, we didn’t think too<br>deeply about ‘no-kids zones.’ Now we think it’s discriminatory. We always call<br>places beforehand to ask if we can bring our daughter.” Children remain welcome<br>and visible at malls. The Seoul government offers a “Multi-Child Happiness<br>Card,” which gives parents discounts at select amusement parks and theatres.<br>When it was first introduced, you needed three kids to qualify; now you qualify<br>with two. Daum, the artist, told me, “We joke that soon enough they’re going to<br>give the ‘multiple-kids card’ to households with only one.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>It is a poignant irony that among Korea’s few<br>child-friendly places are former schools. In a picturesque river valley outside<br>the northern city of Chuncheon, an old elementary school has been converted<br>into a café and resort that resembles a high-end sanatorium, with blond wood<br>and poured concrete. Alongside nostalgic references to the “innocent smiles of<br>children long ago,” its brochure offers a family photo-shoot package; the price<br>includes basic retouching, although they promise not to “go overboard.” For<br>families who can’t afford premium coffees, the Seoul government has repurposed<br>a collection of rural schools as family campgrounds.</span></p><br><br><p><span>One lies in the mountains not far from the D.M.Z.; I<br>visited at the tail end of foliage season. An uneven parking lot had been<br>outfitted with a matrix of black tents erected atop low wooden platforms. The<br>old cafeteria featured a few game tables. A pink-sweatsuited adolescent played<br>a desultory Ping-Pong match against his uncle. The boy’s father told me, “We<br>come here with our children so we won’t be bothered by other people’s<br>judgment.” Outside, dry brown leaves blew around in a light rain, and most of<br>the families huddled under awnings that had been installed to protect the<br>tents. One solitary little girl played with a bright bird-shaped kite attached<br>to a plastic fishing pole. As I left, I noticed a statue of a boy with a torch,<br>identical to the one I’d seen at the school in Haenem, but considerably the<br>worse for wear.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Countries have tried everything to reverse demographic<br>collapse. In Hungary, women with four or more children gain a lifetime<br>exemption from income tax. In Georgia, the Orthodox Patriarch offered to<br>personally baptize any baby born to the parents of more than two children.<br>Although some nations have stabilized at a low level, there is not a single<br>modern example of one that has managed a sustained recovery from very low<br>fertility to replacement. The world’s most lavishly pro-natalist governments<br>spend a fortune on incentives and services, and have increased the fertility<br>rate by approximately a fifth of a baby per woman. Some observers believe that<br>subsidies could succeed, but they would have to be on the order of three<br>hundred thousand dollars per child.</span></p><br><br><p><span>One smoggy morning, I visited Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of<br>Seoul, at his City Hall office, which recalled the captain’s deck in a space<br>opera. He has focussed primarily on the dire shortage of housing in Seoul, a<br>city where almost fifty per cent of people now live alone. He listed his other<br>initiatives: the Childbirth Encouragement Project, which included “eighty-seven<br>subprojects,” and the Mom and Dad Happiness Project, which comprised<br>“twenty-eight subprojects.” While the Mayor lectured me, a large screen on the<br>far wall ticked through an optimistic slide show of inverted pyramids and other<br>fanciful renderings of urban futurism. When I mentioned that some demographers<br>now regard population decline as a phenomenon to be managed rather than<br>remediated, he intimated that voters were an obstacle to more profound<br>adjustments. On my way out, two of his aides directed my attention to a lobby<br>café where espresso drinks were prepared by a robotic barista arm.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Some Korean companies pay their employees to have children,<br>but the private sector now generally accepts that it must adapt to a world<br>where children are luxuries. Analysts anticipate a<br>hundred-and-sixty-billion-dollar “silver industry” to meet the needs of healthy<br>pensioners. One travel agency expects that seniors, in the absence of<br>grandchildren to spoil, will spend their disposable income on pricier trips.<br>Conglomerates like Hyundai are planning high-end retirement communities for<br>those who cannot rely on their families for eldercare. Companies that once<br>catered to the mass market will have to pivot to a premium clientele. Samsung<br>has long relied on wedding registries for the sales of large appliances. Cho,<br>the celebrity demographer, praised a recent company plan to sell a few really<br>fancy refrigerators in place of many adequate ones. The new line is called<br>Samsung Bespoke.</span></p><br><br><p><span>The United States is nowhere near the point of robotic<br>baristas. The current “crisis” might well go the way of the population bomb.<br>The sociologist Philip N. Cohen told me, “If you think you have a model<br>now that predicts birth rates in two hundred years, you’re just drawing lines<br>on a chart.” Most scholars deem our nascent panic to be counterproductive; in<br>the reassuringly titled “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDecline-Prosper-Changing-Advantages-Children%2Fdp%2F3030916103%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3D1DC03R2NSJ2OA%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0Kgm50zNbwHUBFSU9ENWA2pJfWn2St5fa8azaDcKSlt1auOchKmWfZm6r09xmJZ3.PHHKpcgT7cDScEYzy_T0JKv5VWzGfX0EuMLM8uYEUGM%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3DDecline%2520and%2520Prosper%26qid%3D1740175521%26sprefix%3D%2Caps%2C198%26sr%3D8-1"><span>Decline and Prosper!</span></a>,”<br>from 2022, the Norwegian demographer Vegard Skirbekk reiterates that “low, but<br>not too low,” fertility is a good thing. There is, however, an asterisk<br>attached to this. Two decades ago, Skirbekk helped contrive a thought<br>experiment called “the low-fertility trap hypothesis,” which proposed the<br>possibility of an unrecoverable downward spiral. Ultra-low fertility meant far<br>fewer babies, which meant far fewer people to have babies, or even to <i>know</i> babies;<br>this feedback loop could even shift cultural norms so far that childlessness<br>would become the default option.</span></p><br><br><p><span>This eventuality had seemed remote. Then it more or less<br>happened in Korea. When I asked Skirbekk if other countries might follow suit,<br>he replied, “Quite a few, possibly.” Rotkirch, the Finnish demographer,<br>underscored the notion that reproductive cues are social. “In a forthcoming<br>survey, I want to ask, ‘Have you ever had a baby in your arms?’ ” she told<br>me. “I think in Finland it’s a sizable portion that hasn’t.” These mimetic<br>dynamics play out not just within countries but between them. Hwang Sun-jae, a<br>sociologist who studies fertility norms, traces the swift dissemination of low<br>fertility in part to social media’s role as an accelerant of global<br>monoculture. It has never been easier to acquaint yourself with the opportunity<br>costs of childbearing—the glamorous destinations unvisited, the faddish foods<br>uneaten. “People once had only local comparisons,” he said. “Now they see other<br>people’s lives—in New York City and England and France—and they have a sense of<br>relative deprivation: my life is not good enough.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The costs of an aging and diminished society feel more<br>abstract. Last year, an online sketch portrayed a traditional Korean<br>first-birthday celebration in ten years’ time: the <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2022%2F12%2F12%2Fat-qatars-world-cup-where-politics-and-pleasure-collide"><span>World Cup</span></a> stadium<br>hosts the festivities for a crowd of ten thousand, including the country’s<br>President. Regular life, in the video, is peppered with minor inconveniences:<br>food orders can take more than ninety minutes. The actual inconveniences might<br>not be as minor. By 2050, Korea’s labor force will be about two-thirds of its<br>current size, and food delivery might be a thing of the past. Cho advised the<br>Nongshim noodle company that it would soon be impossible to hire anyone in<br>Busan, Korea’s second-largest city.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Retirement ages will continue to increase. Autocratic<br>countries, where politicians can ignore older voters, might simply deny<br>pensions to the childless. New forms of factionalism could test the limits of<br>liberal coexistence. Younger workers in social democracies might increasingly<br>resent the taxes they pay for entitlement programs that they will never<br>themselves receive. Men, especially those of low status, are currently much<br>less likely to have the number of children they desire, if they have children at<br>all. If this trend continues, every election will be an incel election. In “<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChildren-Men-JAMES-P-D%2Fdp%2F0571342213%2Fref%3Dtmm_pap_swatch_0%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26dib_tag%3Dse%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wlbKNIaEGNomVxoUtnfYEhXiNLp7loivhF10j7DfYWHw5ePomGuA0c0SlgEQmrDDzb1bppmjQqDDfCh6WK8mHMnBF84vL4cMalyhjnVIVwvdyLpU0W1fUr49mflqTZ5Vf9GWKFs6knHedNquY6vbJktlQfvU4ZQKclSC7m39WXyLnrOdlqKWGhvb1ozNg_dSa70n35znjDnjswqUazcV2mkj6MN4X_23svY9k7KtxIA.g560USPfZ72wMx2_ZbeLpmy6oIhr0UCrvroKUVmnIO4%26qid%3D1740175571%26sr%3D8-1"><span>The Children of Men</span></a>,” not<br>the film but the original novel, by P. D. James, the social order cannot<br>withstand such a void. Great Britain is an island of twilit senility overseen<br>by a strict Warden. Basic infrastructure is shored up by an immigrant<br>underclass, and the elderly are chained to barges that disappear beneath the<br>sea. (A few years ago, Yusuke Narita, a Japanese economist at Yale, called upon<br>Japanese seniors to perform seppuku.)</span></p><br><br><p><span>Many Koreans told me that they look forward to a society<br>with less competition—a smaller, gentler world with a greater share of<br>resources for all. In this picture, the future is exactly the same as the<br>present, except with fewer people. It is just as probable, however, that<br>inequality will increase. As universities close en masse, the remainder might<br>prove even more selective. If Korea’s labor force becomes insufficient to<br>produce and distribute basic goods—a distinct possibility by the end of the<br>century—they could be hoarded by those of means. The demographer Dean Spears<br>noted that the more idiosyncratic our needs and desires the more we rely on the<br>fact that other people share them: “If you need specialized medical care,<br>you’re less likely to find it in a rural place than in a big city, where there<br>are more people who need the same sort of thing you need.” If current trends<br>continue, in several decades there will be many fewer Koreans, and virtually<br>all of them will live in metropolitan Seoul—a city-state surrounded by<br>wilderness, ruin, and, if they are lucky, robotic rice cultivation.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Economic prosperity has long relied on an expanding<br>population to drive greater output, increased demand, and new markets.<br>Advocates of degrowth have pointed out the manifest unsustainability of such<br>intergenerational pyramid schemes, but their implosion will probably not be<br>peaceful. If the bottom falls out of, say, the Chinese real-estate market—among<br>the largest asset classes in the world—the entire global economy could totter.<br>Iroquois “mourning wars” against neighboring tribes—raids to replenish their own<br>numbers with captives—intensified in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,<br>after disease and colonial violence depleted the nation. Russia’s invasion of<br>Ukraine seems to have been motivated in part by Vladimir Putin’s desire to<br>increase the motherland’s quantity of ethnic Russians.</span></p><br><br><p><span>In a<br>grotesque way, the “Mad Max” scenario represents a comforting fantasy. A<br>steampunk world—with war-making vehicles lashed together from old radiators and<br>Atari circuit boards—is at least a vital one. But a depopulated landscape might<br>actually be characterized by quiescence. There is an extensive literature that<br>links economic dynamism to youth. Young people, who have wilder imaginations<br>and a greater appetite for risk, drive the bulk of entrepreneurial activity.<br>For <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Felon-musk"><span>Elon Musk</span></a> and his<br>followers, children are technological lottery tickets: we never know which<br>genetically enhanced baby might at last invent a functional warp drive. One<br>technological pro-natalist told me, “We do not exist just to consume, and we<br>don’t want the end state of humanity to be the Villages in Florida.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The most persuasive aspect of technological pro-natalism is<br>not what we might theoretically gain from a larger population. It is the<br>foreboding of what we might lose with a diminished one. The evolutionary<br>anthropologist Joseph Henrich has summoned the example of the aboriginal<br>Tasmanians, who were cut off from mainland Australia about ten thousand years<br>ago. Their population was too small and too diffuse to preserve their<br>expertise, and they apparently forgot how to make complex bone tools, how to<br>make warm clothing, and even how to fish. And sheer numbers are only part of<br>the story. For a culture to evolve, it needs a lot of different kinds of<br>people—stubborn, nutty people with outlandish proposals. The weirdest people<br>around are almost always children.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Demographers often worry that indulging in sci-fi<br>speculation might inadvertently prompt governments to adopt draconian measures.<br>Still, the demographer Leslie Root admitted that she sometimes wonders, “Is it<br>possible we actually evolved to be too smart for our own good, and we’re just<br>too interested in other things to go along with the bullshit of having to have<br>enough kids to perpetuate the species? I don’t know! Maybe?” She collected<br>herself, then added, “What’s most interesting to me, when I think about what it<br>might be like to maintain a stable human population, is that there’s a very<br>real possibility that we’ll need to reinvent society.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Adecade ago, a Korean reality program showcased wealthy<br>celebrities in unattainably idyllic scenes with their children. A more<br>realistic portrayal of family life might have been more fruitful. Miji and<br>Ho-gil are a shy, attractive, and slightly unusual couple, the parents of two<br>boys. Miji, who is thirty-three, studied media in Seoul, and then freelanced<br>for a broadcaster in Gwangju. Ho-gil, who is thirty-eight, got a job after<br>college at a children’s foundation, where the “strict milestones” that govern<br>Korean aspirations lost their hold on him. He recently saw a report that Korea<br>was the only wealthy industrialized nation where the highest personal priority<br>was economic improvement rather than love. He told me, “In Korean society, we<br>are educated to have one single goal, but then, once you’re grown up, you don’t<br>know what to do with your freedom—you get lost in the world, and you don’t know<br>how to have a good life.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>They met at a book club in 2016. Miji matter-of-factly<br>characterized herself as “the kind of person who is always swayed by other<br>people’s opinions,” and she was drawn to Ho-gil for his independence. After<br>five years of living separately, they decided to get married. She wanted a<br>large, formal wedding, but he imagined something more intimate, and they<br>compromised. Miji told me, “I can’t ignore social norms, but I have to strike a<br>balance between what society wants and his beliefs.”</span></p><br><br><p><i><span>“You know how sometimes you say you’re not hungry, but then<br>you see what I’m eating and ask for a bite, and I always let you and I’m never<br>annoyed?”</span></i></p><br><br><p><span>Cartoon<br>by Suerynn Lee</span></p><br><br><p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p><br><br><p><span>Link copied</span></p><br><br><p><span>Shop</span></p><br><br><p><span>She hoped to have children, but at the time he felt<br>“selfish”—he wasn’t used to being around kids and wasn’t sure what to do with<br>them. He read some books about children, and they had a “very intense debate<br>and discussion.” She had no job security, and he told her, “If you’re serious<br>about this, change your job fast.” She found a position as a museum curator.<br>Ho-gil told me that he “isn’t interested in moving up the ladder,” so he wasn’t<br>worried that he’d be penalized for taking time off. But Miji seemed more<br>ambivalent: “If you have career ambitions, it’s really hard to make the<br>decision to go on leave for children.” (She noted that she has been passed over<br>twice for a promotion.) At the time, Gwangju offered a monthly payment to<br>parents of about a hundred and fifty dollars, on top of a five-hundred-dollar<br>subsidy that the federal government paid each month until the child went to day<br>care. For Ho-gil, the money made the prospect thinkable. “All his decisions<br>were down to the numbers, and the numbers worked out,” Miji said.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Their first child, Wooju, was born in 2022. When they<br>brought him home from the hospital, the first thing they did was apologize to<br>their neighbors, warning them that they “might move around and make noise.”<br>Fortunately, the elderly couple downstairs was “more forgiving than most.” Miji<br>and Ho-gil were very happy. It was easy to imagine having a second.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Regional birth subsidies sometimes succeed on paper, but<br>these statistics are artificially inflated by “take and dash” parents, who move<br>to a place temporarily for the money—as if the entire country were playing a<br>bizarro version of musical chairs. In 2023, Gwangju curtailed the subsidies.<br>But, just as Miji became pregnant again, Gangjin, a small city about an hour<br>and a half away, announced an offer three times as generous. As it happened,<br>Ho-gil’s parents worked a farm there. Much of what Miji knew about the area was<br>gleaned from a reality-television show about the renovation of ghost-town<br>houses; her friends found the prospect of their moving to Gangjin inexplicable,<br>even shameful. Still, this past October, the family relocated.</span></p><br><br><p><span>On a weekday morning, they had me over to their tidy, spare<br>apartment. One of the only adornments on the walls was a long-defunct<br>video-intercom console, its molded curves like a “Star Trek” fossil. The meagre<br>trappings seemed like a defiant statement of their priorities, and the home was<br>warmed by their togetherness. Their younger son, ten-month-old Eun-byul, was a<br>round child dressed in a green bib that made him look like a little flower. He<br>had only just begun to say “Mommy.” They were impressed by how dissimilar the<br>two boys were—the older one sensitive and introverted, the little one active<br>and outgoing. Their lives are largely isolated. They’re grateful for the<br>region’s rural beauty, but the closest pediatrician is about a twenty-minute<br>drive away. Miji said, “If your baby isn’t healthy, you can’t live here.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>They had noticed one neighbor with a baby, and they were<br>hoping that at some point they’d say more than “hello.” They have otherwise<br>resigned themselves to the fact that they’ll have few opportunities to meet<br>other parents until school begins, when they’ll join a parent group chat for<br>logistics. The town features three places they can take the kids, including an<br>indoor playground run by the local district office. They showed me photos of<br>Eun-byul in a little sandbox on a linoleum floor. The town’s one “trendy<br>Instagrammable café,” as Miji put it, has declared itself a no-kids zone.</span></p><br><br><p><span>They seemed pleased for the chance to discuss the<br>banalities of rural family life. Miji’s friends weren’t interested in hearing<br>about it. They told her, “Once the children are older, you’ll come back to<br>Gwangju for their education.” She’d attended a <i>hagwon</i> to<br>prepare for the college entrance exam, and she wasn’t inclined to deny her<br>children the same advantage. Ho-gil had not, and he didn’t think it was<br>necessary. In fact, he wasn’t convinced that a college degree was essential,<br>which to most Koreans is as radical as saying that he didn’t need hot water.</span></p><br><br><p><span>When they do return to their jobs, they will both face an<br>hour-and-a-half-long commute each direction. They consider that a concern for<br>another day. Ho-gil picked up Eun-byul, who bounced on his lap with a contented<br>sigh. He said, “Of course I have doubts, and I wonder what my life would have<br>been like if I hadn’t chosen to have a family.” But he’d been wrong to assume,<br>as his friends did, that “fatherhood eats away at your personal life.” Still,<br>my (male, unmarried, dog-owning) interpreter, who told me later that such<br>affectionate behavior was uncommon among Korean fathers, couldn’t help but ask<br>him, “Aren’t you bored?”</span></p><br><br><p><span>There’s a philosophical view, best associated with the<br>scholar L. A. Paul, that the decision to have children is fundamentally<br>irrational. A rigorous cost-benefit analysis might produce an estimate of a<br>child’s expected value, but the experience is transformative in a way that<br>renders the calculation irrelevant. You will have made a decision by the lights<br>of a person you will no longer be. There’s something inescapably patronizing<br>when parents make this argument. I remain unsure if it’s true, yet I’ve heard<br>myself repeat it. For the usual reasons of work-life intractability, writing<br>this piece has taken me away from my own little boys. When I asked my<br>eight-year-old why someone should have children, he stopped punching his little<br>brother long enough to say, “We’re excellent company.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>The leap-of-faith argument makes sense only if we, and the<br>society we live in, remain open to such transformation. In Korea, one graduate<br>student told me, “The standard life course is boring. Surprises are not<br>virtues. We can imagine all of the things until we die.” Before the Asian<br>financial crisis, in 1997, the economist Kim Seongeun told me, the top scorers<br>on the collegiate entrance exam often went on to Seoul National University to<br>study physics. When a faltering economy prompted large companies to fire their<br>scientists, he observed, many parents converged on the idea that medicine was a<br>safer path. It didn’t take long for the top scorers to become doctors instead.<br>Kim wasn’t exempt from the tendency to hedge his bets: “How can I place my own<br>son in a small boat?” To become a parent at all, I remarked offhandedly, was to<br>perceive all boats as too small. He laughed and thought for a moment, then<br>said, “Maybe the low fertility rate here is because people are smart. The<br>risk-free asset in a diversified portfolio is zero kid.” He just wasn’t sure<br>what to make of it all in the end. He said, “The low fertility rate is not<br>really good or bad. We just don’t know.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>This is the intellectually responsible position.<br>Emotionally, it’s a little evasive. Rotkirch, the Finnish demographer, recalled<br>a newspaper item in which a young woman asked why she should sacrifice her body<br>and her partnership for a pregnancy. Such anxieties are a natural prelude to<br>any vault into the unknown. Still, Rotkirch marvelled, “My idea was that it<br>just happens and it’s normal to be nervous.” Chang Pilwha, who has been an<br>influential women’s-studies scholar for forty years, echoed this bewilderment.<br>“Many of my best feminist friends say the best thing they’ve ever done is have<br>a child, and nobody should brand that as conservative or liberal,” she said.<br>She is apprehensive about what society will look like once fewer and fewer<br>people are parents. As she put it, “Becoming a mother or a father is a precious<br>process of learning to be human, and the lack of that experience with<br>vulnerability is only going to create more ruthlessness.”</span></p><br><br><p><span>Child<br>rearing is not a necessary condition for vulnerability. It’s not even a<br>sufficient one. But there may nevertheless be something irreducible about the<br>shared experience of parenthood—a life in which your fragile heart now seems to<br>beat on the outside of your body. You see the guardians of a sleeping child on<br>the subway and think, These are not just random strangers but fellow-passengers<br>with utterly exasperating human beings for whom they would unequivocally die.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Children have long played a symbolic role in a debate that<br>was carried out far over their actual heads. For everyone who saw them as the<br>ultimate affirmation of life itself, someone else saw our treatment of them as<br>reason to despair. The poet <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2004%2F07%2F26%2Ftwice-collected"><span>Philip Larkin</span></a> wrote,<br>“Man hands on misery to man. / It deepens like a coastal<br>shelf. / Get out as early as you can, / And don’t have any<br>kids yourself.” It didn’t much matter. Most people went ahead and had them<br>anyway.</span></p><br><br><p><span>It seems as if we might now be transforming an old and<br>insoluble philosophical conflict into an empirical experiment with real stakes.<br>Sometimes it seems as though we’re in a hurry to do so. The fertility-rate<br>culture war wields children as symbolic extensions of ourselves. People look to<br>the birth rate as an index of what is normal, and no one is safe from the dread<br>of judgment. Conservatives with large families fear they are seen as zoo<br>animals. Liberals without children fear they are seen as selfish careerists or<br>libertines. This may not just be a consequence of the fertility decline; it<br>might be intensifying it. Children could survive being yoked to the value of<br>humanity as a whole. It feels much more perilous to treat them as instruments<br>of our own identities.</span></p><br><br><p><span>Children are variables in our lives. But they are also<br>strange birds of their own. Religious people talk about them as carriers of the<br>divine spark, technologists as messengers from the future. Secular humanists<br>are content to mumble something about the imagination. In any case, they should<br>probably be prevented from sticking their fingers into sockets or setting fire<br>to our homes. But we might otherwise trust them to figure out what they mean,<br>or how to mean it. We might stand before them as models of humility and<br>ambivalence. It is not fair for us, as individual parents or as a society, to<br>expect them to bear the weight of our certainties. They are, after all, just<br>children. ♦</span></p><br><br><p><span>Published<br>in the print edition of the <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2025%2F03%2F03"><span>March 3, 2025</span></a>, issue,<br>with the headline “The End of Children.”</span></p><br><br><p> </p></div></p></div>
