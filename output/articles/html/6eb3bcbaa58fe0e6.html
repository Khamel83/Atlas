What a time to be alive. </p><p><span>Writing about politics is kind of a lose-lose. No matter what I write, a bunch of people will hate it. When I wrote </span><span>Democrats got mad at me for even considering Trump, and Republicans got mad at me for believing there was anything redeemable in the Democratic Party. </span></p><p>The truth is, though, there is nothing happening right now that impacts the types of companies I write about and invest in ‚Äî Vertical Integrators and crypto, which LPs thought was an insane combination when I raised Fund III ‚Äî than what‚Äôs happening in politics now. </p><p>Among the biggest risks to any of these companies is that government regulation (or regulation by enforcement) will dramatically slow them down or even stop them dead in their tracks. I believe that these companies are the highest-leverage way to improve the human condition, so to me, there‚Äôs almost nothing more important than making sure they‚Äôre free to try to succeed, and politics is a big part of that. </p><p>As I‚Äôve been watching American politics play out live for the past week, though, I noticed that there‚Äôs a lot more in common between the current moment and the types of things that I normally write about here, and even more reason to be optimistic than I expected. </p><p>That‚Äôs the Not Boring mission: to make the world more optimistic. In other words, Make America Optimistic Again. </p><p>I just ask that you read with an open mind. </p><p>Let‚Äôs get to it. </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e2eaf225-b046-4438-ac66-8db9fec5e5b8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F520feff9-9991-45fa-af81-8c96c5b34557_1200x600.png"></a></figure></div><p><span>My hunch is that we‚Äôre in the beginning of the mother of all bubbles, a bubble machine, the bubble that spawns a thousand bubbles: </span><strong>the Trump Bubble</strong><span>. </span></p><p>One of the most shocking things about last week‚Äôs Presidential election is just how excited so many people seem to be that Donald Trump won. </p><p>Not everyone is, of course. Some people think this is the end of democracy. But some other people are ecstatic. They believe this election changes everything.

After all, both Trump and bubbles get a bad rap, both at least partially deserved. </p><p><span>When you hear the word ‚Äúbubble,‚Äù you might think, ‚ÄúOverinflated thing that is bound to pop.‚Äù The word has negative connotations, earned in particular by the bad bubbles.

If you bet that the future will look mostly the same, you can take on debt to lever up your bet. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Inflection bubble: ‚Äúinvestors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past.‚Äù Think: the dot-com bubble. If you think that the future will look meaningfully different, you buy equity in the things you think will benefit most from the difference. </strong></p></li></ol><p><span>Inflection bubbles, they argue, drive progress. Their argument is similar to the one I made in </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/245214d1-bfb4-47da-9f73-a2deddecca1a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Infinity Missions</a></em><span>: bubbles attract resources to important projects that would not make sense to fund or work on under a normal cost-benefit analysis. </span></p><p>Take the Apollo Program: </p><blockquote><p><em>When President John F. Kennedy declared in May 1961 that ‚Äúthis nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon,‚Äù no one knew how to do it. Rockets, launchpads, space suits, hardware, software, zero-gravity food ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt exist, and there were no experts in these domains‚Ä¶</em></p><p><em>It wasn‚Äôt just that the space program lacked what was necessary to get to the Moon ‚Äì scientists weren‚Äôt even sure it was possible. </em></p></blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe Manhattan Project succeeded because definite optimists were powered along by bubble dynamics,‚Äù they write. ‚ÄúThe same could be said of Apollo.‚Äù </p><p>Bubbles pull the future forward by concentrating tremendous amounts of financial and human capital on very specific visions of the future, and allowing for otherwise-wasteful exploration and parallelization in the pursuit of making it a reality.</p><p>Things that may not have happened - ever - without a bubble, happen rapidly with them. </p><p>Byrne and Tobias make a compelling case that Moore‚Äôs Law itself is responsible for Moore‚Äôs Law: ‚ÄúThe industry has exhibited the classic bubble behavior in which predictions about the future ‚Äì particularly bold and nearly indefensible ones ‚Äì end up driving behaviors that make those predictions come true.‚Äù </p><p>Expectations that chips would continue to improve let people design products that would take advantage of better chips which let chipmakers know that there would be demand which spurred the investment that made chips improve. </p><p><span>In other words, a sufficiently compelling vision can bring itself about.

A bubble in what, exactly?</p><p>Elon Musk, who was instrumental to Trump‚Äôs victory and will likely be instrumental in the Presidency, has called Tesla‚Äôs Gigafactory ‚Äúthe machine that builds the machines.‚Äù Work on the Gigafactory, get that right, and making the cars themselves is easy. </p><p><strong>America is the machine that builds the machines that builds the machines.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Viewed as a machine, America has accumulated gunk in its gears. </p><p><span>It still builds excellent machines (companies) that build excellent machines (their products). ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù never resonated with me, because </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/a633f2ed-85d3-42b7-8eac-42a5879fc769?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">I think America is still the greatest country in the world</a><span>. But it‚Äôs slower and clunkier than it used to be. </span></p><p>Comparison to other countries masks a deeper truth: America is not as great as it could be.</p><p><strong>The Trump Bubble, if it materializes, will be about upgrading and cleaning the gunk out of the machine that builds the machines that builds the machines so that it can run at full capacity.</strong><span>  </span></p><p><span>As Santi Ruiz wrote yesterday in </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e7df657d-aeb9-4a8a-8f8f-3fa93b8f825d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">The Five Things President Trump Should Do On Day One</a></em><span>, ‚ÄúPresidents come into office with a list of policy priorities and campaign promises, and they don‚Äôt tend to be excited about reforming the nuts and bolts part. But they should be.‚Äù</span></p><p>I think the reason there‚Äôs so much excitement, much more than I expected, about Trump‚Äôs second election is that people believe this President will be. That this administration is going to tighten the nuts and bolts on the machine so that they can run their own machines more smoothly. </p><p>For people who believe in America, capitalism, and themselves, there‚Äôs no more inspiring vision. </p><p>As of today, it feels strong enough to induce the strongest bubble ever blown. </p><h3><strong>Signs of a Bubble</strong><span> </span></h3><p>While the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Program are the two case studies in the book with direct government oversight, I think the Trump Bubble will look more like Moore‚Äôs Law. </p><p>‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law,‚Äù Byrne and Tobias write, ‚Äúis perhaps the most compelling and enduring example of a two-sided bubble, wherein the expectation of progress in one domain spurs progress in another, which then propels growth in the first.‚Äù </p><p>There‚Äôs a two-sided bubble at play here, too. The Trump Administration is telling people that it will be easier to build, invest in, and accomplish big things, which is already making people more excited to build, invest in, and accomplish big things. The more energy and excitement there is behind what people are building, the easier it will be for the government to fix the machine. </p><p>Rainmaker‚Äôs Augustus Doricko captured the sentiment as well as anyone: ‚Äúwe have a 4 year window to go as hard as fucking imaginable.‚Äù </p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/99ceb825-37ed-44f6-ae92-eb296c42386f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed27ad3-60c2-43c3-b316-208825fa64f9_908x586.png"></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/0d7f96da-398f-4ab9-8c84-1264f520107b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Link to Tweet</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>With control of the Senate, House, and Executive, the government is promising to streamline processes and remove friction.

Add it, or something like it, back! </p><p><span>I think we‚Äôll be surprised, though (or maybe we won‚Äôt) with just how much there is to streamline and optimize, and just how smoothly things run when you do. People are excited ‚Äì filled with </span><em>thymos, </em><span>or ‚Äúspiritedness,‚Äù ‚Äì precisely because this is the first administration in a long time that they believe will actually try to push the limits and see where it breaks. </span></p><p><span>More than anything, though, a willingness to break things is a </span><strong>return to embracing risk</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Right in Chapter 1, Byrne and Tobias call out risk aversion as a main source of stagnation. ‚ÄúWhat these symptoms of stagnation and decline have in common is that they result from societal aversion to risk, which has been on the rise for the past few decades,‚Äù they write. </p><p><span>It‚Äôs an argument I made in </span><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c46843ff-6315-4cbb-adbe-cfd3b27765b1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Riskophilia</a></em><span>, which I concluded by saying:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>I refuse to believe that America‚Äôs best days are behind it.

Like any good bubble, it‚Äôs risk-on. </p><h3><strong>Risk On</strong></h3><p>Sometimes, as a writer, you get lucky.
