        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Here’s the link to apply now for the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card with a 125,000-point bonus after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months.

If you’re the type of traveler who prefers to get the most nights out of your hotel points, this article — and the entire “Stretch Your Points” miniseries — is for you. In recent installments of this series, I’ve presented some low-tier Marriott properties, domestic Hyatt properties, international Hyatt properties, domestic Hilton properties, international Hilton properties and domestic IHG properties where you can stretch your points.

It’s not a secret that my husband, JT, and I have stayed at a lot of IHG properties since giving up our apartment over two years ago. In fact, we’ve actually stayed at many of the properties described below. So, even more so than the previous installments of this series, the list below isn’t simply a theoretical discussion of IHG’s best international properties that you can book for 10,000 points per night. Instead, it’s a compilation of hotels that we’re likely to visit (or revisit) due to their location and how far our points can take us there.

Let’s continue this miniseries by studying how many nights you can squeeze out of the current 125,000-point sign-up bonus on the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card, as well as look at some international IHG properties where you can stay for just 10,000 points per night.

How many nights can I get from the bonus?

The IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card currently offers an increased sign-up bonus of 125,000 points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months. The card provides an anniversary free night that’s valid at properties costing 40,000 points or less, which makes it relatively easy for most cardholders to justify the $89 annual fee. But the card’s other perks, including IHG Platinum Elite status, can also provide significant value. Plus, cardholders get a fourth night free on award stays, which means you can stretch your points even further when you stay for four nights or longer.

IHG award nights normally start at 10,000 points per night. So not counting the points earned while meeting the spending requirements to trigger the welcome bonus, you could squeeze 16 nights out of the IHG Premier Card’s 125,000-point bonus if you stay in increments of four nights at 10,000-point properties (aka four nights for 30k points). TPG’s most recent valuation pegs the value of IHG points at 0.5 cents each, so 10,000 points are worth about $50 and the 30,000 points needed for a four-night stay at a 10,000-point property are worth about $150.

Alternatively, you could book select properties from the PointBreaks list for as little as 5,000 points per night. This means you could theoretically squeeze 33 nights out of the IHG Premier Card’s 125,000-point bonus. But, since the properties on the PointBreaks list change every few months and are removed from the list once the PointBreaks allotment for that property is exhausted, this guide only considers properties that normally cost 10,000 points per night.

Property profiles

IHG currently has 366 10,000-point properties globally and 248 of these properties, or 68%, are outside the U.S. Here’s the breakdown based on brand of the 10,000-point IHG properties located outside the U. S:

Many of these properties are practical hotels along highways or in the suburbs. But some of the IHG Rewards Club hotels bookable for 10,000 points or less per night are real gems.</p><p>After stumbling across a few 10,000-point gems, I undertook a time-consuming project to find the best IHG Rewards Club hotels bookable for 10,000 points or less per night. Then, I wrote this guide and a guide to the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/stretch-your-points-ihg-domestic/">best IHG Rewards Club hotels in the US bookable for 10k points per night</a>.</p><p>Today I'll start by introducing the basics you need to know about <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/redeem-points-ihg-rewards-club/">redeeming IHG Rewards Club points</a>. Then, I'll discuss how many nights you can squeeze out of the sign-up bonus on the IHG Rewards Premier Credit Card and the IHG  Rewards Club Traveler Credit Card.

So, now the number of IHG Rewards Club points required to book a reward night varies based on the specific hotel, your travel dates and when you book.</p><p>Luckily for my research, many of the hotels that were bookable for 10,000 points per night pre-dynamic pricing are still available at that rate. However, now you'll also find some IHG hotels bookable for as little as 7,500 points on select dates. Based on <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/">TPG's valuations</a>, 7,500 IHG points are worth $38 and 10,000 points are worth $50.</p><p>IHG doesn't have a calendar search tool to find the least expensive reward nights at a particular hotel. And, IHG doesn't provide a points range for each hotel. As such, I can't guarantee that all of the hotels described in this guide will be bookable for 10,000 points or less per night on your dates.</p><div><picture><img src="https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg"></picture><div><div>Daily Newsletter</div><div>Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter</div><div>Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts</div></div></div><h2>Maximizing the IHG Rewards Club credit card bonuses</h2><p>One easy way to <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/earn-points-ihg-rewards-club/">earn IHG Rewards Club points</a> is to sign-up for an IHG Rewards Club credit card.

Based on <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/">TPG's valuations</a>, this bonus is worth $750. There's an $89 annual fee (waived for the first year). However, I've found I can <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/ihg-premier-annual-fee-worth-it/">justify the IHG Premier's annual fee</a> by using the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/top-hotels-ihg-premier-card-free-night/">anniversary night</a> and taking advantage of the card's automatic <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/what-is-ihg-elite-status-worth/">Platinum Elite status</a>.</p><p>If you don't want to pay an annual fee, there's also the no-annual-fee IHG Rewards Traveler Credit Card.

Based on <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/">TPG's valuations</a>, this bonus is worth $300.</p><p>One valuable perk offered by both cards is a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/how-to-get-ihg-fourth-night-free-award/">fourth reward night perk</a>. This perk reduces the cost of every fourth reward night to zero when you redeem points for a stay of four nights or longer.

But, most of the hotels I describe in this guide cost 10,000 points per night on most dates. So, I'll assume 10,000 points per night for this calculation. And I'll also assume that you'll <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/maximizing-redemptions-ihg-rewards-club/">maximize your IHG Rewards Club points</a> by staying in four-night increments.</p><p>So, you could squeeze 15 nights out of the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/ihg-rewards-credit-card-offers/">IHG Premier Card's 150,000-point bonus</a>. And, you could stretch the IHG Traveler Card's 60,000-point bonus for 8 nights. However, you'll have more points to work with since these calculations don't consider the points you'll earn while <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/ways-to-meet-minimum-spending-requirement/">meeting the minimum spending requirements</a> to trigger the sign-up bonus.</p><p><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/">TPG's most recent valuation</a> pegs the value of IHG points at 0.5 cents each, so 10,000 points are worth about $50. And, the 30,000 points needed for a four-night stay at a 10,000-point property are worth about $150. Now, let's take a closer look at some of my favorite IHG properties outside the U.S. that are usually bookable for 10,000 points or less per night.</p><h2>Hotels in Europe</h2><figure><div><img src="https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2020/04/Berlin-Christmas-Market-scaled.jpg?width=1080"></div><figcaption>Christmas markets in Europe can be a compelling reason to visit.

Here are a few of the most appealing IHG hotels in South America bookable for 10,000 points or less on most dates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/fortaleza/frlbr/hoteldetail"><strong>Holiday Inn Fortaleza (Brazil)</strong></a>: This hotel is situated along the shore of Iracema Beach near Beira-Mar Avenue.

And, unlike most Holiday Inn hotels, this property includes breakfast in your room rate.</li><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/ibouk"><strong>Holiday Inn Manaus (Brazil)</strong></a>: This hotel is on Manaus's outskirts in an industrial area, but could be an excellent place to stay before or after a trip deeper into the Amazon.</li><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/764co"><strong>Holiday Inn Sao Paulo Parque Anhembi (Brazil)</strong></a>: This hotel is in northern Sao Paulo but has a free shuttle to a nearby metro station and mall.

(Photo by Katie Genter/The Points Guy)</figcaption></figure><p>Within Asia, most of the IHG hotels that are bookable for 10,000 points or less per night are in mainland China. Unfortunately, many of these hotels aren't in cities U.S. tourists typically visit. But, it's worth checking IHG if you're <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/high-end-hotels-off-the-beaten-path/">traveling off the beaten path</a> in China as I did on my <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2018/03/chugging-past-yurts-camels-and-remote-outposts-a-trans-mongolian-train-review/">Trans-Mongolian train review</a>.</p><p>Even if you don't want to travel far off the beaten path, there are several IHG hotels in Asia that you may find appealing for 10,000 points per night. Here are four of my favorites:</p><ul><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/hlmmx"><strong>Holiday Inn Resort Batam (Indonesia)</strong></a>: This resort is in <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/indonesia-family-friendly/">Indonesia</a>, just a short ferry from <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/singapore-best-times-to-visit/">Singapore</a>. The resort even provides free transfers to and from the Sekupang Ferry Terminal and Waterfront Ferry Terminal. There are four restaurants, two bars, three pools, a kid's club, a water slide and a game room at the resort. I visited this resort earlier this year and can't want to return.</li><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/svsbp"><strong>Holiday Inn Express Taoyuan (Taiwan)</strong></a>: I've stayed at this hotel multiple times on <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/how-why-mileage-run/">mileage runs</a>. Each time, I enjoyed the friendly staff. And, on numerous stays, I was given impressive upgraded views as a Platinum Elite. The hotel is an inexpensive Uber from Taipei airport. But, Taoyuan is also an interesting city to explore in conjunction with a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/07/know-before-you-go-taipei/">trip to Taipei</a>.</li><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/mcia6"><strong>Holiday Inn Express Shanghai Putuo (China)</strong></a>: This hotel is in the western part of Shanghai, about halfway between Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) and downtown Shanghai. The hotel is a four-minute walk from a metro station, which means you can easily reach attractions throughout Shanghai.</li><li><a href="http://brandcycle.shop/8ym4s"><strong>Holiday Inn Express Suzhou New District (China)</strong></a>: This hotel is in Suzhou's New District, within walking distance of two metro stations. The hotel is near Suzhou Amusement Park and offers hot breakfast daily as part of your room rate.</li></ul><p>If you decide to travel to China, it's a good idea to have <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/apps-need-for-vacation-to-china/">these useful apps installed on your phone</a> and a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/3-ways-to-secure-your-data-while-using-public-wi-fi/">VPN installed on your computer</a>.</p><h2>Map of all 10,000-point hotels</h2><p>Here's a map of all the 10,000-point IHG properties outside the U.S. as of Aug. 14, 2019. I didn't check that all of these properties are still part of IHG Rewards Club or bookable for 10,000 points per night or less on most dates. But, as most properties I checked are still bookable for 10,000 points per night or less, I decided this map was still worth including in this guide.</p><p>Dark blue pins are Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites, light blue pins are Holiday Inn Express, green pins are Holiday Inn, dark green pins are Holiday Inn &amp; Resort and purple pins are Holiday Inn Resort.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>I've planned trips around visiting some of the IHG Rewards Club sweet spots described above. And, I plan to visit some of these hotels once the coronavirus pandemic subsides. In particular, I plan to visit the Holiday Inn &amp; Suites Mexico Zona Rosa on an upcoming <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-time-to-visit-mexico/">trip to Mexico</a>. And, I look forward to returning to the Holiday Inn Resort Batam for its fabulous <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/most-amazing-spas/">spa</a> and the Holiday Inn Express Taoyuan for its fun views and friendly staff.</p><p>Although this guide focused on international IHG properties, there are also many <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/stretch-your-points-ihg-domestic/">IHG hotels bookable for 10,000 points in the U.S</a>.
