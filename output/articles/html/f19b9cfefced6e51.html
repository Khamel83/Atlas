            <p>Welcome to Camp52, where we're recapturing the fun of summer as a kid. All month long, you'll find playful, carefree ideas for snacks (s'mores and popsicles, anyone?), drinks, crafts, games, field trips, packing tips, and more.</p><p>In our oh-so busy digital world, I’ve found that one of the most relaxing things you can do on vacation is truly disconnect. And what better way to get off the grid than heading out into the woods for a summer camping excursion?</p><p>Personally, I love camping (even if I don’t do it as much as I’d like!). There’s something so calming about sleeping under the stars and relaxing in nature—without Wi-Fi or video games to distract you.</p><p>However, if you’re planning your first-ever camping trip, you might not know what gear to buy and bring with you. Luckily, there are thousands of avid outdoorspeople who are more than happy to share their thoughts on popular equipment. To that end, here’s a list of some of the most highly rated camping gear that’s sure to make your trip a success.</p><p>First up, you need high-quality sleeping equipment if you’re going to be rested and ready for adventure.</p><p>Reviews: 7,000+Rating: 4.4 stars</p><p>It’s easy to see why this Coleman tent is so popular. It comes in a variety of sizes, sleeping anywhere from two to six people, and even the larger sizes are still incredibly affordable at under $100. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and its rainfly and welded floors will keep you dry, even if the weather outside is soggy.</p><p>Photo by Amazon</p><p>Reviews: 600+Rating: 4.4 stars</p><p>If you need a more spacious sleeping space, this tent from CORE can accommodate up to nine people or two queen-size inflatable mattresses. It includes a room divider, as well as in-wall storage pockets, and the pre-assembled frame makes it incredibly fast and easy to construct. It’s the perfect option if you’re camping with the whole family!</p><p>Photo by Amazon</p><p>Reviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.3 stars</p><p>Don’t feel like carrying an air mattress out into the wilderness? Just bring one of these inflatable sleeping pads instead. They weigh just 16 ounces, so they won’t drag you down, and they’re quick to inflate, unlike full-size mattresses. Plus, they have thousands of glowing reviews—what more could you ask for?</p><p>Photo by Amazon</p><p>Reviews: 4,000+Rating: 4.3 stars</p><p>Coleman is one of the go-to camping brands for frequent adventurers, so it should come as no surprise that they’ve pretty much perfected the sleeping bag. This affordable single-person sleeping bag is ideal for snoozing in 40- to 60-degree conditions, as the plush interior will keep you cozy all night long.</p><p>Photo by Coleman</p><p>Reviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars</p><p>Want to cuddle up with your loved ones under the stars? This queen-size sleeping bag has more than enough room for two people, and it comes with two travel pillows, too.

Folks swear by this particular bug spray from Repel, which contains 40 percent DEET—the highest concentration available in a spray container.

When applied to fabrics (such as your clothing, tent, and sleeping bag), this chemical will keep bugs like ticks and mosquitos away. The best part? It lasts for up to six washes or 40 days, so you won’t have to reapply constantly.</p><p>Photo by Amazon</p><p>Reviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.7 stars</p><p>Once the sun sets on your camp, you’ll need a few lanterns to illuminate your surroundings, and there’s no better option than this one from Streamlight.
