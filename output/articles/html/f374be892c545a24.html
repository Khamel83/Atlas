    <div class="content"><p><font>December 2019<br><br>Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I<br>felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living<br>virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.<br>But did I want them now? No.<br><br>If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since<br>I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had<br>no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,<br>to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.<br>Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be<br>terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they<br>prevailed.<br><br>When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,<br>because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at<br>all.  "Better you than me," I was thinking.<br><br>Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and<br>I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.<br><br>What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded<br>turned out to be wonderful.<br><br>Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical<br>changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was<br>born.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt<br>protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was<br>driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a<br>crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking "I have<br>to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is<br>someone's child!"<br><br>So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is<br>great.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you<br>that you'll be happy if you join the cult too  but only because<br>joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you<br>happy to be a cult member.<br><br>But not entirely. There were some things<br>about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.<br><br>For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my<br>observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed<br>that I wrote "Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids." Of course<br>the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only<br>noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed<br>them?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only<br>times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.<br>Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler<br>is something very few parents enjoy.<br><br>What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were<br>all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about<br>these much  the magic is hard to put into words, and all other<br>parents know about them anyway  but one of the great things about<br>having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is<br>nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be<br>doing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just<br>be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing<br>them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments<br>for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but<br>that's what you feel.  You don't need to look any<br>further than where you are right now.<br><br>Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they<br>were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.<br><br>My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that<br>was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble<br>for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was<br>essentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times<br>too.<br><br>I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd<br>really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this<br>woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected<br>her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling<br>the truth.<br><br>She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been<br>interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.<br>You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're<br>really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously<br>fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty<br>times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised<br>me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely<br>not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it<br>does.<br><br>There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,<br>terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience<br>that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I<br>implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for<br>the lifeboats.<br><br>Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They<br>definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some<br>people get their act together, but if your act was already together,<br>you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're<br>going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not<br>sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only<br>way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,<br>you tend to have to work on their schedule.<br><br>You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill<br>promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had<br>kids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,<br>whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be<br>times when you have to stop, even if it is.<br><br>I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds<br>a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens<br>at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had<br>kids, I get enough done.<br><br>I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part<br>of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It<br>hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But<br>if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The<br>fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more<br>about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum<br>game. Only one idea at a time can be the <br><a href="https://paulgraham.com/top.html"><u>top idea in your mind</u></a>.<br>Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it<br>will less often be some project you're working on.<br><br>I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when<br>I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That<br>drives me to get things right. And when I was writing <br><a href="https://paulgraham.com/bel.html"><u>Bel</u></a>, I told<br>my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you<br>say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.<br>Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to<br>Africa.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net<br>ahead. But the wind is there, no question.<br><br>On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it<br>won't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?<br><br>And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't<br>overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like<br>before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the<br>ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.<br>That was so great. Why did I never do that?<br><br>See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before<br>kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used<br>it.<br><br>I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up<br>happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,<br>there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it<br>on tap, almost any bedtime.<br><br>People's experiences as parents<br>vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I<br>had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other<br>parents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that<br>kids bring.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the<br>fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year<br>olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris<br>for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></p></div>
