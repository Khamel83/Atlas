        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Via Miles to Memories,  there is a valuable new AMEX Offer!  You’ll receive 4,000 bonus AMEX Membership Rewards points when you pay $300+ for a Marriott stay by February 28, 2018.

AMEX Offers are an easy way to save on purchases you might make anyway.  Just add the offers to your AMEX card and use that card for your spending!

Use Your Eligible AMEX Card to Book a $300+ Stay at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach & Spa and Earn 4,000 AMEX Membership Rewards Points

AMEX Offers are targeted, so sign-in to your American Express online account to see which deals you qualify for.

AMEX Offer for Marriott Stays

When you spend $300+ on a Marriott stay, you’ll earn 4,000 bonus AMEX Membership Rewards points.  Here’s what you need to know:

Minimum spend can be completed with both room rate and room charges

You must pay for your stay by February 28, 2018

Valid only for hotels located in the US and US territories

You must make your reservation through an official Marriott channel (Marriott website, mobile app, etc.)

Excludes The Ritz-Carlton®, EDITION®, Bulgari®, Marriott Executive Apartments®, Marriott Vacation Club®, Protea Hotels®, and all SPG® Participating Hotels & Resorts brands

This deal should stack with Marriott’s MegaBonus promotion, or any other promotions they may publish.

AMEX Offers are a unique perk to American Express cards.  And a great way to offset any annual fees you’re paying!

American Express cards that are eligible for AMEX Offers include:

The Platinum Card® from American Express

The Business Platinum® Card from American Express OPEN

Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN

And don’t forget, if you have multiple AMEX cards, here’s the trick to get these discounts more than once.

Bottom Line
