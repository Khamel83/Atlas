In June ‘24, Chegg started cutting costs, laying off 441 employees (23% of the company) and closing two offices for an estimated cost savings of $40-50mm.</p><p><span>But the AI onslaught continued and the cuts proved insufficient. On top of competition from tools like ChatGPT, the company has been negatively impacted by </span><strong>Google’s AI Overview</strong><span> feature, which was rolled out broadly in August ‘24. After seeing the impact of Google’s AI Overview, Chegg announced a second round of layoffs in November ‘24, letting an additional 319 people go.

The June 17, 2024 8-K stated that Chegg would let 441 people or 23% of the company go (implying a workforce of 1,917 people before and 1,476 after). The November 12, 2024 8-K said that another 319 people or 21% of the current workforce were let go in the second round of layoffs (implying a workforce of 1,519 before and 1,200 after). The February 24, 2025 10-K stated that the company had laid off 760 people (foots with 441+319), but that this represented 22% of the workforce (implying a workforce of 3,454 before and 2,694 after). The 10-K states elsewhere that Chegg had 1,271 employees as of 12/31/24. Based on this, we are assuming that the 22% figure in the 10-K is incorrect and that the 760 people fired represent approximately 40% of Chegg’s pre-layoff workforce (760 laid off in ‘24 divided by 1,917 implied workforce prior to June ‘24 layoff). But, whatever. Whether they’re math is wrong or ours is, the company is straight-up screwed. </h5><h3>💥Another Failed Liability Management Exercise (Mitel).💥</h3><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/6ef09dd8-6b2d-4e81-b9dc-3eaf8ea51c76?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eac330a-4b0b-4cae-ad92-86c2ce6243b0_611x219.png"></a></figure></div><p><span>On March 9 and 10, 2025, </span><strong>Searchlight Capital Partners L.P.</strong><span> (“Searchlight”)-owned </span><strong>Mitel Networks, Inc. </strong><span>(“Mitel”) and 15 affiliates (collectively, together with Mitel, the “debtors,” and together with their non-debtor affiliates, the “company”) filed prepackaged chapter 11 bankruptcy cases in the Southern District of Texas (</span><strong>Judge Lopez</strong><span>).*</span></p><p>You may recall these guys scored a New Year’s Eve win in the New York Supreme Court's First Appellate Division, which upheld this beast of a liability management transaction (the “LME”).</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e782249d-bb60-45c4-8435-4cb6684b44f8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9286a026-074a-4632-8e69-d22f63a6eb9a_1078x734.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p><span>We noted it in passing </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/e729d2ce-9f80-436e-b202-3246cbeaf901?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">here</a><span> and covered the complaint </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/74d92cbb-518f-4b16-98c9-5c72ef0162db?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8">here</a><span>, so we’ll try not to retread old ground.

Notwithstanding these initiatives, by November 2024, the Company determined that it would not be able to pursue a refinancing of its existing funded indebtedness and would not be able to service its existing interest expense beyond the first quarter of 2025.”</em></code></pre><p>Value accretive indeed! Honestly, the chutzpah it takes to put those two sentences back-to-back — that was only two months after the Zoom deal signed! Did future debt service just sneak up on you?!</p><p>Starting in November ‘24, the company engaged with an ad hoc group of senior lenders (i.e., the new money and uptiered loans from ‘22)(the “ad hoc group”). A month later, in December ‘24, it skipped out on a junior loan interest payment and entered into a forbearance agreement with the ad hoc group, which, through extensions, brought everyone to the petition date.</p><p><span>During that time, the company, the ad hoc group, those litigious junior lenders, BTG, as well as “</span><em>certain</em><span>” holders of priority lien loans, got into a room together and (quite impressively) negotiated a fully-buttoned-up restructuring support agreement (“RSA”), which has the support of 100% of the ABL loans, 72.1% of the priority lien claims, and “</span><em>over</em><span>” 81.1% of the non-priority lien term loan deficiency claims (i.e., the 2L, 3L, and legacy term loans) (the “non-priority lien claims”).

This apparently prompted rumors of a possible merger between another recently-bankruptcy telecom, </span><strong>Audacy, Inc.</strong><span>, with CMLS since the man behind Renew Group, </span><strong>Manoj Bhargava</strong><span>, is also a large shareholder in Audacy. Homeboy apparently has a hard-on for busted telecom companies!</span></p><p>Synergies with another radio company that just emerged from bankruptcy last year? Good luck, Mr. Bhargava, this, on just the CMLS side, is what you’re going to have to contend with:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/397c405d-e9d0-47f4-9831-2ef0c9ef6abd?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f74a301-ba2b-42d1-a55f-1dbbcee74df6_700x241.png"></a><figcaption>Source: PETITION LLC, Company Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>CMLS</span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d813958b-0caf-4f60-840b-0a0891d43334?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"> reported</a><span> FY’24 earnings on February 27, 2025 and … well … you can see how that went over with the market:</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/407506df-c522-493f-bd10-35f07d0d5585?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec1e071-2775-4e34-8fe1-2751b57a4d2a_661x491.png"></a><figcaption>Source: Google.

For FY’24, the company announced total revenue of $827.1mm (a 2.1% YoY decline), adjusted EBITDA of 82.7mm (a 8.8% YoY decline), and a net loss of $283.3mm.</p><p><span>Ok, yeah, sure, the company (sorta) recently completed an LME transaction that, among other things, captured debt discount and kicked out maturities but it still left itself with $671.6mm of funded debt and now sits on just under $64mm of cash. Go ahead. We’ll wait. You can take all of these figures and run some pretty gnarley ratios if you feel like it. The ratings agencies sure felt like it: both </span><strong>Moody’s</strong><span> and </span><strong>S&amp;P Ratings</strong><span> have the company sitting comfortably in junk territory. Similarly the market has taken it all in. As of March 3, 2025, the New Notes were pricing at 35c on the dollar. The new term loan wasn’t faring any better at ~38c on the dollar.</span></p><p>We often hear about companies that have undertaken LME deals being primetime candidates for more potential restructuring down the road. You know, kind of like Mitel ⬆️. Given the secular decline of legacy media and the fact that FCF has gone into the red, the need for this radio operator to right the ship is critical. Absent perfect execution and some innovation, this sucker’s debt looks like it’ll be awfully challenging to refi when the time comes. </p><p>Something tells us you can predict what headline we’ll use “when the time comes.” </p><h5><strong><span>*CMLS ended up reporting that there was a 97% participation rate in their</span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/c3b9d87f-525e-4a90-ad5f-449b879be6d0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"> 1Q’24 press release</a><span>. </span></strong></h5><div><div><div><p><strong>PETITION</strong> is a reader-supported publication.
