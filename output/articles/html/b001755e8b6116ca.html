($WBA)</strong><span>(“Walgreens”) operates a jaw-dropping 8.5k(!) retail pharmacy stores across the US, easily making it the second largest pharmacy chain in the country behind fellow behemoth </span><strong>CVS Health Corporation ($CVS)</strong><span>. Size, however, doesn’t necessarily translate to success: Walgreens’ stock is down a brutal 77% over the past five years and for its part, CVS is down ~33% over the past year.

There’s been a perfect storm of sh*t over the past number of years. To name a few issues, (i) pesky pharmacy benefit managers have pressured the pharmacy chains on pricing, causing increasingly squeezed margins, (ii) massive opioid litigation sparked panic and pause amongst investors, and (iii) new online entrants like </span><strong>Amazon Pharmacy</strong><span> increasingly threaten incumbents and what was historically their most competitive advantage, a convenient neighborhood location. You know what’s more convenient than a convenient neighborhood location? A prescription landing in your mailbox the next day without you having to get off your fat a$$! </span></p><p><span>To counteract these headwinds, Walgreens decided to make a synergistic acquisition. Enter value-based primary care operator, </span><strong>Village Practice Management Company LLC</strong><span> (d/b/a “VillageMD”).</span></p><p>In July ‘20, Walgreens announced a $1b investment in VillageMD for a ~30% equity stake. The thesis was simple: having an in-store primary care clinic attached to a drugstore should drive higher prescription counts. Patients (with a special focus on those with chronic conditions) will go straight from the physician to the pharmacy next door to fill the prescription. This convenience, the thinking went, would drive higher medication adherence rates and, in turn, improve patient outcomes.</p><p>In October ‘21, Walgreens put an additional $5.2b into VillageMD and increased its ownership from 30% to 63%. Curious to see if this strategy worked? Here is the stock performance since the VillageMD acquisition:</p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/bc535055-ab5c-46ed-a0da-30f308ef3941?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1330,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7c2ff0b-ff94-4d74-b6eb-5529091ac590_665x503.png"></a><figcaption>Source: Google. </figcaption></figure></div><p>That’s right.

Andres Rubio, CEO: I do not.</code></code></pre><p>So, whether these cases should even continue in ‘Murica, rather than, you know, be heard in any one of 22 potential other jurisdictions, was a bit of a hot button issue.</p><p><span>But before we get there, why are the debtors looking to restructure? Per Mr. Rubio, things haven’t exactly been going great over in Sweden. High inflation, high interest rates, a slowing European economy, and of course, our favorite first-day boilerplate, COVID have put pressure on the company and negatively impacted its portfolios. Moreover, in recent years, the company decided to branch out: rather than just servicing the loans of </span><em>others</em><span>, it purchased its own “</span><em>portfolio investments.</em><span>” Ahhh, servicers becoming investors, what could go wrong? Anyone want to guess how that went? Yuuuuup, turns out picking winners and losers is a helluva lot harder than servicing, so in ‘23, the company tucked its tail between its legs, “</span><em>embarked on a shift to a ‘capital-light’ business,</em><span>” and “</span><em>pivot[ed] towards its investment management capabilities</em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>In connection with that “</span><em>strategic direction</em><span>,” Intrum offloaded a bunch of </span><s>that crap</s><span> </span><em>those investments</em><span> to </span><strong>Cerberus</strong><span> in January ‘24 as part of a JV transaction, which the market dumped all over.*** Since then, the company’s suffered more headwinds in the form of credit downgrades (</span><em>“Between January and July of 2024, Moody’s and S&amp;P each downgraded the Company’s corporate family rating four times (Moody’s was downgraded from B1 to Caa2)</em><span>”), low debt trading values (“</span><em>The Company’s unsecured notes traded as low as in the 50-cent range immediately prior to the Company’s restructuring efforts</em><span>”), and a decline in equity value (“</span><em>During the course of 2024, Intrum AB’s equity shares have lost more than 80% of their value”</em><span>).

That resulted in two noteholder groups forming: a “majority ad hoc group” represented by </span><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong><span> </span><strong>LLP</strong><span>****</span><strong> </strong><span>and the minority ad hoc group represented by </span><strong>Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP </strong><span>(</span><strong>Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP</strong><span> has since subbed in).*****</span></p><p><span>After months of “</span><em>extensive, good faith</em><span>” (</span><em>y’all, this phrasing is so, so tired…</em><span>) negotiations, the company entered into a lock-up agreement with the majority ad hoc group — given the group’s name, hopefully this doesn’t come as a surprise to anyone — which was amended in August ‘24 to bring in the company’s revolving lenders.****** As of filing, 97% of the company’s revolving lenders and 73% of its noteholders support the debtors’ restructuring. Under the proposed deal, (i) the revolving facility would be extended by two years in exchange for more fees, higher pricing, and more collateral (🤑) and (ii) the unsecured notes would take a 10% discount to face in exchange for 10% post-dilution equity, a second lien security interest, and, for consenting noteholders, fees, fees, fees. All other claims would be paid in full, the company would receive $573mm in new money from the issuance of new 1.5-lien secured notes, and equity would ride right on through.</span></p><p><span>But unfortunately for Intrum and its cohort of cheerleaders, that level of support wasn’t enough to get this deal done without an 11, so in October ‘24, Intrum Texas — with a certificate of formation that was still warm — did what it was born to do: stepped up and, in a brazen act of fraudulent transfer, obligated itself on Intrum’s debt to give the debtors </span><em>some</em><span> argument for why they wound up in an American bankruptcy court. The debtors also commenced solicitation of their chapter 11 plan, which happens to contain a very convenient injunction (discussed 👇) arguably prohibiting creditors from objecting to any follow-along Swedish proceeding, which everyone agrees is necessary here. You see, Swedish courts aren’t heaps keen on U.S. courts restructuring Swedish companies, so they don’t recognize those U.S. proceedings (and a Swedish proceeding was always in the cards).</span></p><p><span>Three days after filing, and not in love with the prospect of taking a haircut on near-maturity debt, the minority ad hoc group dropped a motion to dismiss (“MTD”) for lack of good faith, taking shots at the company’s lack of financial distress, “</span><em>blatant attempt to manufacture U.S. venue</em><span>,” and the fact that any confirmation order entered by the court means exactly squat as far as Sweden is concerned.</span></p><p>A few weeks later, on December 12, that same group tossed in a confirmation objection, asserting the plan wasn’t filed in good faith, it impermissibly paid original issue discount (OID), and that the injunction noted above non-kosherly impaired creditor due process rights by preventing them from objecting to any future Swedish proceeding, teeing us up for a confirmation battle royale, which took place from December 16 through 19, 2024.</p><p><span>During that contest, the minority ad hoc group made a few pointed observations: (i) over the past year, the company had repeatedly affirmed its solvency, (ii) Mr. Rubio and the company’s chairman (</span><strong>Magnus Lindquist</strong><span>) were dumping several million dollars into Intrum stock purchases as recently as November ‘24, and (iii) the debtors had zero non-ginned up connections to the U.S. Here’s a live clip of Mr. Finestone in court: </span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/006ff824-d330-47de-b444-7f83f5b0ad34?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_512,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda82acdf-66f7-4446-92d4-34ad7e304e50_512x275.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY. </figcaption></figure></div><p>You’d think that second point would be some decent evidence that the company wasn’t in too bad of a shape: rational actors don’t usually piss away their moolah, but then again, #YOLO. </p><pre><code><code>Andrew Leblanc, counsel to the debtors: Mr. Lindquist, you were asked … whether you waste your money, I think it was?

Nah, we all know there’s only one outcome.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of course the court bought, hook, line, and sinker, into the debtors’ narrative and ruled in their favor on both the MTD and confirmation.******* Where do you think we are?</p><p><span>Taking a page from the </span><em>Serta</em><span> and </span><em>Mitel</em><span> courts, Judge Lopez delivered that ruling on every judge’s new favorite date: December 31. Up first, the MTD. While the court quickly noted that the Bankruptcy Code’s definition of “cause” for dismissal isn’t limiting (for the legal scholars out there, it’s an “includes” definition), it gives sixteen-odd examples. The court’s takeaway:</span></p><pre><code><code>“...[W]e do learn something from [those examples]. They all refer to post petition acts, failures to act, or events that occur after an estate is created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Therefore, this quite intentionally non-exhaustive, non-limited definition is very much limited after all, and we can — nay, must — happily ignore all the </span><s>gamesmanship</s><span> strategizing that made a chapter 11 even possible (like forming Intrum Texas in October ‘24, making it a guarantor of Intrum’s debt, moving cash into the United States). To boot, the court found that the company was in good, old-fashioned financial distress, at least enough to support a filing — debts were going to be coming due, dammit, and it’s </span><em>quite </em><span>inconvenient to have to give meaning to a few billion in equity value and the millions poured into stock purchases by management in recent months — best to ignore that. The Bankruptcy Code having been dealt with and inconvenient facts tucked away, the court arrived at good faith and the MTD was toast.</span></p><p><span>With that off the table, confirmation of the plan was a </span><em>fait accompli</em><span>. The court quickly found that it was filed in good faith — technically a different standard than the MTD, but all the same not surprising with the court’s ruling 👆 — and with a few general nods to “OID is a claims resolution issue,” “the plan is a global settlement,” and “the minority ad hoc group is relatively small” to dispose of the OID argument and sidestep fees paid only to consenting noteholders. Turning to the injunction, let’s start with the language:</span></p><pre><code><code>“Upon entry of the [confirmation order], all Persons and Entities shall be enjoined from taking any actions to interfere with the implementation or consummation of this Plan or the vesting of the Estates’ assets in, and the enjoyment of such assets by, the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to this Plan.”</code></code></pre><p>After reading that provision, the court, with a straight face, delivered the following:</p><pre><code><code>“[T]he injunction provisions are I think are customary and appropriate. I don't think they preclude parties from raising issues of Swedish law.”</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/655b6fb2-ac59-4050-bd0d-3d51e7d7fc82?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_336,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F562ab9ac-7cb8-4377-804f-e0450e87f0df_480x480.gif"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Really</em><span>? What do you think the chances are that, if the minority ad hoc group so much as lifts a finger in the Swedish court, the debtors will go tattling to Judge Lopez, arguing that the group is interfering with “</span><em>the implementation or consummation</em><span>” of the plan? We’ll peg it at “damn high.” To minimize that issue, perhaps the minority ad hoc group ought to borrow from the debtors’ playbook and form its own totally legit Swedish sub to contribute its claims into.</span></p><p><span>Taking this ruling on its face, what company, no matter how tenuous its connections to the United States, can’t seek chapter 11 relief? It seems nigh impossible not to qualify — just set up a sub in your choice jurisdiction (SDTX, </span><em>obvi</em><span>), load it up with the company’s debt, and throw some cash into a retainer account.</span></p><div><figure><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/7e2281c3-8b7c-4a40-bd11-1f5f81d5f771?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_550,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa719c162-bcc0-49ea-8296-7fcc2e4d3b71_640x356.gif"></a><figcaption><span>Source: Tenor.
