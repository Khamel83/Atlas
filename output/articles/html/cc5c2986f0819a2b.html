Plykea grew out of the men's mutual realization that there was no centralized node committed to simplifying a process that many homeowners tried to do on their own: to enliven their IKEA kitchens with a wider, more aesthetically-enticing array of materials than the particleboard offered to them. The two often found that re-outfitting IKEA's METOD line with new, birch plywood fronts was unsettlingly expensive, a byproduct of this decentralization.

So the two teamed up to offer a solution to other homeowners suffering from this same predicament of trying to make their IKEA kitchens feel more personal without totaling their wallets. Both are pretty high-profile designers—Diacon is a co-founder of design agency Normally, while Vergette is an alum of furniture company Vitsoe—and they settled on a simple, obvious name, a portmanteau of plywood and IKEA.

I’m afraid that Plykea only ships within the United Kingdom for now, but they’re a mere month old. They’re hoping to expand to continental Europe and, eventually, the United States. Bummer! It’s a resource I imagine many people around the world could use. Let’s hope it lasts.

In the meantime, distract yourself with never-ending permutations of the Frakta tote.
