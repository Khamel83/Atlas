        <blockquote>If you, as a child or as an adult, read Calvin and Hobbes, you'll remember Calvin's transmogrifier. Ostensibly, the transmogrifier was a cardboard box—but we know that it was magic, capable of transforming one thing into another thing almost instantaneously (though only Calvin and Hobbes could see its effects).
