Today: For nights when you don't have time (and need a bottle of wine).

It's 4 P.M. and you're daydreaming of dinner—you would kill for a simple roast chicken and a cool glass of white wine. Yes, you decide, that's what I'll have for dinner tonight. But as 8 P.M. rolls around and you haven't even fired up the oven, your high hopes of a golden roast get replaced by less time-consuming alternatives, like another bowl of pasta with leftover pesto—but they don't have to. Not only does this roast chicken take a quarter of the time of a traditional roast, but it only uses one pan so you'll have less to clean afterwards. The trick to the quicker chicken is two-fold: First, ask your butcher to cut it into 8 parts for you for faster cooking; second, braise it over the stove top for crispy skin so you only have to bake it for 15 minutes. So help yourself to that bottle of wine—just save some for the chicken.
