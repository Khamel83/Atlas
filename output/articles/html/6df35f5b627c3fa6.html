        <blockquote>When it comes to privacy controls, we may now have too much of a good thing. Smartphone owners must now make more than 100 privacy decisions about how how much data their apps can share on Apple’s iOs and Google’s Android operating systems. That number will only climb as privacy settings affect more of our devices and software.

The result is not more privacy. It’s confusion. “Most people although they care about privacy won’t spend huge amounts of time playing with those settings,” said computer science researcher Norman Sadeh at Carnegie Mellon University in an interview. “Doing the right thing in this space means, in principle, giving more control to users but it becomes unmanageable and underused.

Tired of waiting for the tech giants to fix the problem, Norman Sadeh’s team at Carnegie Mellon University developed a personal privacy assistant app powered by machine learning. The app learns your preferences by asking a few key questions about privacy, and a machine learning algorithm uses this data to group users into distinct profiles.

The CMU team presented findings from a study with the app at the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security in Denver this June. Users accepted 79% of the app’s privacy settings recommendations significantly reducing the time users needed to select the desired privacy controls (about 20% of the settings were entered by users, and only 5% were changed from the app’s recommendation). Participants were also generally permissive. Of the 3,559 app requests for data, users rejected only 19% in their privacy settings.

That makes privacy something that has to be solved by closing the distance between the users’s desire to safeguard their data and the complexity of doing so today. By using machine learning to simplify personal privacy settings, Sadeh believes “we can help overcome this gap,” he said.

Maybe people will start using them.</blockquote>
