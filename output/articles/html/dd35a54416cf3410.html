Even during the most chaotic of times, we can rely on the world producing (at least) five optimistic stories worthy of coverage in </span><em>The Weekly Dose of Optimism</em><span>. It’s like clockwork. This week, Joe snuck in some huge last minute plans for a nuclear buildout, plus the future of nanotechnology, distributed networks, gene editing, and much more. In fact, this might be the most action-packed Dose in a long time.

In addition, the plan calls for 35 gigawatts of new capacity within a decade. </p><p>This is one of the most ambitious plans for nuclear energy ever laid out by a U.S. president — instead of maintaining the status quo or focusing entirely on safety concerns, the plan meets bipartisan momentum for nuclear energy, which has been pulled forward by the AI boom and other geopolitical issues. Nuclear buildout has stagnated for the last 50+ years, with barely any capacity added since the 90s. This plan flips that with a goal to not only increase nuclear capacity, but triple it within 25 years. </p><p><span>The plan itself is pretty on point.

The plan calls for capacity expansion through the construction of new sites and the revival of idle plants, the deployment of small reactors, and public/private partnership to make it all happen. The plan also calls for a number of regulatory and policy changes to make this all possible: expanding the skilled-labor workforce to build and work on these sites, removing regulatory barriers to construction and operation, and tax policies to make it all economically feasible. </span></p><p>Let’s just hope DOGE doesn’t come after this specific governmental initiative…</p><p><em><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/0733c0d2-4515-406f-b0bf-fe0afc7d55e0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">Jacob Rintamaki</a></em><span> </span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong><span>The creation of </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/06d89564-4e07-4f71-a27a-a2a6d4b84d69?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">molecular nanotechnology</a><span> (highly capable molecular machines that assemble products with atomic precision) could </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/f49681ad-3cde-4b12-9c5f-564e89b6bb93?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">rival</a><span> or </span><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/187e0240-ae83-4e7f-a03b-0859a3dd3174?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU">surpass</a><span> the impact of the Industrial Revolution. </span></strong></em></p><p><em><span>Our physical production capacity could be increased by many orders of magnitude while making our current computers, medicines, and machines look primitive by comparison.

This new methodology could restore the sweetness of tomatoes, without sacrificing size constraints or negatively impacting farming yields. </p><p>Of course, tomato sweetness is really just the start. It’s not a huge leap to imagine this technology being used to increase the flavor profile of a number of other fruits and vegetables, and importantly, doing so in a way that doesn’t negatively impact farming productivity or economics. Genetic modification of foods has gotten a bad wrap over the years — in reality, it’s a bit more nuanced: being able to mass produce safe, tasty food has come with tradeoffs. But this type of CRISP gene medication is generally viewed as better. It offers precise, natural-like genetic modifications without introducing foreign DNA, reducing unintended effects and improving safety and efficiency as compared to traditional GMOs.</p><p><strong>Bonus 2:</strong><span> </span><strong>I tried to melt down a real-life nuclear reactor</strong></p><p><em>Christian Keil for First Principles</em></p><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/9a254c77-57f5-4c23-a22c-625e58804e39?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/MXOxv_nKUQM"></a><p>Friend of Not Boring Christian Keil takes his show, First Principles, to Austin to pull the control rod out of a nuclear reactor and see what happens.
