Quick Thoughts

DAmex seems to be making a push to get their cards in position for your Amazon spend. Last month, there was the Fire Sale of sorts (See: Can I interest you in 40 Amazon Fire tablets?). There was another $25 off of $50 that surfaced in the interim and now this 20% off discount. This discount can be split over several purchases up to a maximum benefit of $50 off. In other words, whether you place a single order for $250 in items or you place 5 orders that are $50 each, you’ll have gotten 20% off and will be capped. That said, it’s nice that this works on multiple purchases, so you don’t need to hunt for the perfect use to max it out all at once.

Don’t forget to go to Amazon and click to activate this promotion (as seen in the screen shot above) before making your purchase. If you were targeted, you should see the “click to activate” button when visiting that link.

Note that this promotion is only valid with American Express Membership Rewards points. This one is not compatible with Discover points or Citi Thank You points.

Doctor of Credit lists some good ideas for items to purchase to take advantage of this discount. Check their post for more details.
