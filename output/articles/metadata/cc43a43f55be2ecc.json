I suggest you try it.\n\nYahtzee\nEveryone should have their own signature dice shake, because even if you come in second, you'll look cool doing it.\n\nGuillotine\nSomewhat macabre in title, but pretty harmless in practice. You line up a bunch of characters from the French revolution and collect them with action cards—gather the most points (i.e. the most valuable characters), and you win.\n\nFor The Readers and Wordsmiths\n\nTaboo\nMoby Dick, The Card Game\n\nTaboo\nDon't say it, don't say it!
