For everyone else, all you need is something thoughtful, and who cares what it costs? Getting the best stuff and the best prices is easy as long as you know where to look. Use this guide to fill the family’s stockings, or just crush it at the office white elephant exchange, all for less than a quarter-Benjamin.\n\nXiaomi Selfie Stick\n\nYou’ve heard that old saying about photos, right? That they don’t really exist unless you’re in them too? Pretty sure that was Ansel Adams, or someone. Use this handheld shooter ($18) to get your arm out of the shot, gives everyone the proper number of chins, and gives you room for the whole gang in the same shot.\n\nCredit:\n Amazon\n\nYou've heard that old saying about photos, right?

Mrice has developed a sort of cult following among audiophiles, and has a history of making headphones whose abilities way outperforms the price. The only bad thing? They’re tough to find.

It feels good, it writes well, and it looks like something every Fancy Businessperson needs to have prominently displayed on their desk. Fisher’s $25 model is so good it’s also for sale at the New York Museum of Modern Art. That means you’re writing your cable bill check with a work of art.
