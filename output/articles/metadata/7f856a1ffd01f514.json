For those of us sick of this long winter, OpenTable has released their list of the 100 Best Restaurants in America for a Big Night Out, right in time for al fresco dining weather.\n\n“The list features an array of buzz-worthy restaurants, from up-and-coming to established, trendy to tried-and-true, across 24 states and Washington, DC,” said Caroline Potter, OpenTable’s chief dining officer. “Whatever your notion of a big night out entails, whether it’s a bustling bar scene or a spot to see-and-be-seen, fun is on the menu at any of these honorees.”\n\nWith 18 restaurants on the list, California boasts the highest number of restaurants for a night on the town, with Florida slightly behind with 17 locales. In total, 50 cities are on the list; New York and Las Vegas appear more than any other destination, with Chicago trailing closely behind with seven restaurants.\n\nThe list of the 100 Best Restaurants for a Big Night Out is generated from more than 12 million verified OpenTable diner reviews collected between February 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018. All restaurants with a minimum “overall” score and number of qualifying reviews were included for consideration; qualifying restaurants were then scored and sorted, according to the percentage of reviews for which “hot spot” was selected as a special feature.
