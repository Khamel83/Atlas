So you’ll be able to catch new episodes of shows like The Flash, Supernatural, and Riverdale sometime in 2018. (Lucky viewers in regions like the UK and Australia will reportedly be able to watch new episodes on Netflix shortly after they air on TV.) Netflix also usually gets new seasons of top AMC shows like The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul before the next season begins; season seven of The Walking Dead is up on the service now ahead of its Oct. 22 debut.\n\nWith a little patience, you can catch most of the season’s TV offerings without signing up for a costly pay-TV bundle.\n\nRead this next: For the cost of YouTube’s $35-a-month TV bundle, this is what you could get instead\n\nMost Popular",
