For example, participants were told to create a series of coin flip results—heads or tails—that would be as close as possible to one that might occur by chance.

Participants seemed to think with increasing irregularity from childhood up until their mid-20s—at which point people’s answers looked less like what would happen by chance. This arc means that most of us will hit our most diverse thinking around 25. “At age 25, people can outsmart computers at generating this kind of randomness,” Zenil told Scientific American. After that, computers are actually better at coming up with series without order.\n\nThis work, the team thinks, could be used to study neurodegenerative diseases that result in dementia. Being able to think randomly could be a test of a person’s overall mental capacities, and could be used to monitor the progression of these diseases.\n\nIn addition, Zenil thinks that being able to spew out truly random sequences shows how creative we are. If this is the case, then we would expect to hit our creative peak in our mid-20s.
