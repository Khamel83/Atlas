Simple and timeless and chic, like a little black dress.\n\nIf you want to make a good thing better, Canal House founders Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer suggest a few accessories: Say, bacon and olives. Or sherry and mushrooms. Between you and me, water and cardboard, too, would be wonderful with this chicken. But I had another idea:\n\nKale and croutons.\n\nWhile the chicken takes its sweet time crisping up, we’ll bring a pot of salty water to a boil. Throw in a mountain of chopped Tuscan kale, also known as lacinato, also known as dinosaur—the shiny, deep green, crinkly kind. Cook for less time than most songs. This gives the kale a head start on sautéing, seasons and hydrates it, too.\n\nNow find a loaf of crusty bread. It could be fresh, made this morning and from your favorite bakery.

Add the bread and toss in the fat, cooking until it starts to crisp and turn the color of dark honey. Now add minced garlic and chili flakes (because most things are better with them) and the kale. No need to squeeze or wring the kale out—that lingering water is welcome here, something like Italian pancotto. Nestle the chicken thighs on top. Serve them in the skillet. Or eat from the skillet.
