    "selection": "Each year, millions of Americans pack their bags, some heading off in search of adventure and discovery, others to find some much-needed peace and relaxation. For those looking to avoid the crowds and get back to basics, perhaps a less traditional lodging option is a better idea, especially one that playfully reinterprets the treehouse of your childhood, resulting in a whimsical — and slightly nostalgic — take on luxury accommodations. With eco-friendly construction and unique design elements, hotel owners have branched out and created fully functional, and sometimes quite posh, escapes in the sky. If you’re ready to go out on a limb (pun intended), grab a friend with a sense of adventure — and, preferably, not a fear of heights — and get ready to literally elevate your next vacation!\n\n1. Secluded Intown Treehouse\n\nLocation: Atlanta, GA\n\nPrice: From $375 per night\n\nWhere to book: Airbnb.com\n\nWith more than 230 guest reviews and an average rating of five stars — seriously — it’s no surprise this treehouse was Airbnb’s 2016 most wished-for listing worldwide. Located just outside Atlanta, the host estimates a drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) will take between 16 and 55 minutes, depending on the traffic.\n\nA charming bridge between rooms gives this treehouse a magical feel. Image courtesy of Airbnb.\nThe treehouse is split into three separate spaces — a living room, bedroom and deck. The bedroom has one rolling double bed that can be positioned inside the room or pushed onto a small deck that overlooks a nearby stream. Such tranquil and picturesque settings make this the perfect getaway for couples.\n\nThe bed can be rolled out for an enhanced view. Image courtesy of Airbnb.\nThe simplicity of it all is what guests seem to enjoy the most. Despite its close proximity to downtown Atlanta, the property is quiet, secluded and relaxing. It’s important to note that this treehouse is intended only for one or two guests. Any other requests must be made prior to booking and are rarely approved; the house is known and remembered for its tranquil aura, an impression the owners would like to maintain.\n\nThe treehouse is filled with antique furniture and classic design elements. Image courtesy of Airbnb.\n2. Treehouse Point \n\nLocation: Issaquah, WA, about 30 minutes from Seattle\n\nPrice: From $290–$390 per night, depending on the unit\n\nWhere to book: TreehousePoint.com\n\nTreehouse Point is a collection of six different treehouses, each with a slightly different flavor.

Image by Adam Crowley.\nFor guests requiring a private bathroom, Treehouse Point may not be for you. While only one of the treehouse units has a flush toilet and sink, all guests have access to three full-size shared bathrooms, which, of course, can be locked for privacy.\n\nThe Trillium treehouse features a loft-style design. Image by Adam Crowley.\nWhile the units themselves are quite small and only feature a couple of chairs and a small table, guests are encouraged to use the on-site lodge, which offers complimentary Wi-Fi, games, afternoon tea and snacks.\n\nEnter the Temple treehouse via a wooden suspension bridge.
