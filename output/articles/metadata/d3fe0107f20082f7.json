But traditional maps don’t show the locations familiar to the city’s millions of denizens: the corner in Queens where you can overhear Zulu and Jamaican patois, the trucks selling jerk chicken and dirty rice outside Hasidic synagogues in Brooklyn, the Staten Island Ferry that RZA and Ghostface Killah rode to go to grindhouse theaters in Times Square.\n\nIn their new atlas, Nonstop Metropolis, Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro share 26 maps of New York that prioritize bachata over Broadway, phở over pizza.
