    "selection": "All aboard! For the entire month of September at The Points Guy, we’ll be exploring the world of train travel with reviews, features, deals and tips for maximizing your trip by rail.\n\nIt’s possible to enjoy spectacular views when traveling by air, especially during takeoff and landing. But there’s often not much to see when you’re cruising at 39,000 feet.\n\nThat’s one reason why train travel has long been one of the most popular ways to see the world. In addition to a generally more relaxed form of getting from one place to the next — no plastic bags filled with tiny toiletries or endless crowds at airport security — trains can snake through scenic mountain valleys and connect charming, remote villages. They offer steadily panning views of stunning landscapes that are sometimes exceptionally difficult to access any other way.\n\nThere are trains you have to take (like the L train in New York City) but sometimes, a journey by rail can be a trip in and of itself. We scoured the globe and spoke to expert travelers about the world’s most scenic rail routes: You know, the kind that makes you want to wax poetic like Paul Theroux. From an Amtrak train that leaves New York City every morning to an ultra-luxury locomotive that’s been transporting people to the Golden Age of Travel (and, more literally, between two South African cities) these are 11 of the most scenic train rides on Earth.\n\nIn This Post\n\nSri Lanka Railways in Sri Lanka\n\n“The ride between Kandy and Ella takes you past colorful villages, lush rolling hills, tea plantations and more,” said TPG senior writer Lori Zaino. “It’s a whole cultural experience — locals in my car were singing and clapping the entire time. For an adrenaline thrill, hang out the window (at your own risk) and watch the world go by.”\n\n(Photo by Lori Zaino / The Points Guy)\n\nThe seven-hour ride is extremely inexpensive, and a great way to explore the Sri Lankan countryside. Just be sure to opt for a second class fare so you can look out the window and enjoy the view (but not ride next to, say, livestock).\n\n(Photo by Lori Zaino / The Points Guy)\n\nBook through an agency, like Zaino did, to get your ticket secured in advance (from £13, or $I6). Though tickets purchased at the station may only be a few bucks, don’t underestimate the convenience of having a seat reserved before your arrival in Sri Lanka.\n\nPilatus Luzern in Switzerland\n\nBook any train of any type in Switzerland, and you’ll probably enjoy uninterrupted views of the Alps, charming Alpine villages and glass-like lakes. But for something a bit more adventurous, head to Alpnachstad to ride the Pilatus Luzern, which is the steepest cog railway in the world — ascending to a grade just shy of 50%, though the journey only lasts about 30 minutes.\n\nPhoto by Melanie Lieberman / The Points Guy.\n\nBut you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views from the summit of Mount Pilatus and — if you choose — opportunities to disembark and hike, climb or picnic in the surrounding mountains and valleys. Fares start at 72 Swiss Francs, or about $72.\n\nThe Northern Explorer in New Zealand\n\nFly into Auckland and board the Northern Explorer, which chugs through Hamilton, Otorohanga, National Park, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu en route to the capital, Wellington. Exploring New Zealand by rail, you’ll see everything from volcanic peaks to the rugged coast while stopping to hike the Tongariro Alpine Crossing or navigate the glowworm lit chambers of the Waitomo Caves.\n\n“Every time I’ve done the Northern Explorer train, I’ve needed to get between the two places but haven’t been in too much of a hurry,” travel writer and TPG contributor Elen Turner said. After all, the 12-hour journey isn’t exactly the fastest way to get around New Zealand. So be sure to expect a leisurely ride. Prices begin at 135 New Zealand dollars ($85) for children and 189 New Zealand dollars ($120) for adults.\n\nRocky Mountaineer in Canada\n\n“Traveling through the Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer train from Banff to Vancouver is definitely one of those ‘you-only-live-once’ experiences. It takes you through the most remote areas — ones you could never access any other way. Imagine postcard-perfect scenery in every direction,” journalist Michele Sponagle told The Points Guy. “Be prepared for a forced digital detox since you won’t get a cell signal or have onboard Wi-Fi access frequently throughout your journey.”\n\n(Photo by Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe “First Passage to the West” tour is a four-day journey from Vancouver to Banff that crosses the Continental Divide and passes through the so-called “Spiral Tunnels” carved into the Rockies. Fares start at $1,540 per person and include four meals, three nights in hotels, a tour and national park pass, as well as station transfers and luggage handling. Shorter journeys onboard the Rocky Mountaineer start around $1,2417 per person. \n\nAmtrak Adirondack Train in New York\n\nSure, there are faster ways to get to Montreal from New York City — much faster. But for travelers who are looking for an affordable way to experience the romance of train travel, the Amtrak train that runs daily between New York-Penn Station and Montreal’s Gare Centrale is a leisurely way to experience the Hudson Valley and the shores of Lake Champlain. Bonus points if you take the trip in the fall as the leaves are changing, though sadly, the train’s iconic two-level glass-domed passenger car was just retired. Just remember, this isn’t a luxury experience, so bring a good book, pack a favorite lunch, and don’t even think about relying on Wi-Fi. Prices start at $70 one-way.\n\nBelmond Andean Explorer in Peru\n\nFor both stunning views and gorgeous interiors, opt for a luxury Belmond sleeper train experience, such as the Andean Explorer, which travels from Cusco to Puno, on Lake Titicaca, and the gleaming white stone city of Arequipa.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Belmond.\n\nNo comforts have been overlooked onboard, and the train is even fitted with oxygen tanks and masks for passengers who find the high altitude uncomfortable. Bunk bed cabins with two single beds are available from $3,900 (double occupancy) and include all onboard meals, as well as pre-dinner cocktails and canapés; tours; and transportation too the airport upon arrival in Arequipa.\n\nAmtrak Pacific Surfliner in California\n\nThis summer, TPG’s Mommy Points, Summer Hull, boarded the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner from Anaheim to San Diego.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Amtrak)\n\nDepending on which direction you’re heading, you’ll want to carefully select a seat on the “surf” side of the train, which hugs the coastline as it works its way back and forth between the Los Angeles area and San Diego nearly a dozen times every day. Prices start around $30 each way.\n\nBlue Train in South Africa\n\nSince the 1920s, South Africa’s Blue Train has been carrying travelers between Pretoria — near Johannesburg — and Cape Town in luxurious cars with panoramic windows (best for admiring the passing vineyards and major attractions like Table Mountain).\n\n“I took the Blue Train back in 2012 with a South African friend,” recalled Nadine Jolie Courtney, a luxury travel advisor with Elite Travel International. “I can’t imagine a more spectacular way to see the South African countryside . . . It felt like being transported back in time to an elevated, bygone era of travel, with white tablecloths, private ensuite bathrooms (complete with tubs!), a dress code for dinner and jaw-droppingly gorgeous scenery . . . The night sky was particularly memorable. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen so many stars, and it felt as if the whole of the Milky Way was visible.” Rates start at 18,405 South African rand, or about $1,212.\n\nDurango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Colorado\n\n“I’ll never forget the unique Colorado vistas, cliffs and being surprised by what was around the next bend,” recalled Swanette Smith (aka Grandma Points).\n\n(Photo by Roxanne Davis.)\n\nRide a vintage coal-fired, steam-powered locomotive and enjoy stunning views as you crisscross the Animas River, navigate the San Juan National Forest and hug the sheer edge of the mountains. “[It’s] short, very scenic,” said TPG’s executive news director Scott Mayerowitz, who said the 45-mile, three-and-a-half hour ride is really about the views, not the destination. Prices start at $69 for adults and $42 for children in the off-season. \n\nShinkansen in Japan \n\nIn addition to reliable service and ultra-clean cars, a ride on Japan’s bullet train is a great way to see the country’s scenery while traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto. “On my way … I enjoyed a beautiful view of [mountains] and Japanese towns and, if you’re lucky, you can spot the famous Mount Fuji,” said Adrianna Qi, TPG’s paid social associate. (If you’re originating in Tokyo, watch for the mountain to appear about 40 minutes into the journey — and be sure to snag a seat on the right side of the train.) Both Qi and TPG’s senior executive assistant, Christie Matsui, said that you’ll want to be sure to pick up a bento box at the train station beforehand. Seven-day Japan Rail passes begin at 29,110 yen, or $273. A one-way ticket to Kyoto from Tokyo can cost 13,080 yen, or $123.\n\nJacobite Steam Train in Scotland\n\n“Aboard the Jacobite Steam Train, which played the role of the Hogwarts Express in the “Harry Potter” movies, passengers feel like they’re on their way to Hogwarts,” Canadian travel writer and photographer Johanna Read told TPG. “Starting at the base of Scotland’s highest mountain, Ben Nevis, the train passes by Scotland’s moors and lochs and then slows for photos as it traverses the 21 arches of the curved Glenfinnan Viaduct also featured in the films. The end of the line is the pretty seaside town of Mallaig, rather than Hogsmeade.”\n\n(Photo by Darren Murph / The Points Guy)\n\nRead recommends that travelers on a budget consider the “less magical” ScotRail train, which follows an identical route. “You can [even] take a photo of the Jacobite engine as it departs from Mallaig before hopping back aboard your own train,” Read said. Prices start at $28 for children and $50 for adults.\n\nMaximizing Train Travel\n\nIt can be harder to redeem points for train travel through Cape Winelands than for a flight, but it’s not especially tricky to maximize booking your adventure. If you’re booking a trip on one of the iconic Amtrak routes in the US, such as the Adirondack or Pacific Surfliner, earning and using points is still very much an option on the table either via Amtrak Rewards or fixed-value points program.\n\nThe Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and Chase Sapphire Preferred Card will both earn you 2x on your train trips, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Citi Premier both earn 3x on travel.\n\nBuilt-in credit card protections are also still relevant when booking an adventure by train.\n\nStay tuned to TPG throughout the month for lots of additional train-related content as we walk through train travel award redemptions, maximization strategies, reviews, stories from the rails, routes and more.\n\nSign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more travel tips!\n\nFeature photo by Darren Murph / The Points Guy.",
