    "selection": "You can’t undersell the benefits of a good night’s sleep; you can, however, undersell yourself on quality bedding. I myself have been a convert to linen sheeting for years now. Linen’s naturally rumply state is a part of the appeal, yes (I hate making my bed), but it’s also incredibly soft, breathable and easy to wash.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone who grew up needing to make their bed before leaving the house every morning might gravitate towards sateen or percale sheets; to each her own. While I can’t claim to know what’s right for your best night’s sleep, I can say that I’ve looked into a lot of options and come away with a few top contenders for the best sheets at every price point—pressing optional.\n\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nHawkins New York Stonewashed Linen Bedding\n\nFrom $198 for a queen sheet. The dynamic design duo behind Hawkins New York has a way with linens, and their sheets are no exception. Made in Portugal from Belgian linen, each set is available in a range of mix-and-matchable colors that are sure to keep you happily nesting, no matter the season. Pillow cases, sheets, and duvet covers are available in the Food52 Shop, in king and queen sizes.\n\nSnowe Sateen Sheets\n\nFrom $188 for a full set. Sateen sheeting could seem unnecessarily fancy at times, but Snowe’s long-staple cotton sheeting is decidedly unfussy, delivering downtown attitude with an uptown twist. Available in full, queen, and king sizes.\n\nStonewashed Linen Bedding (Queen)\nSateen Sheet Set, Snowe Home\n\nLinge Particulier Pillowcase & Flat Sheet\n\n$245 for a flat sheet. The fantastic French brand Linge Particulier makes a whole range of home and decor accessories, including aprons and curtains. But it’s their breathable stonewashed linen sheeting in a range of saturated hues that knocks it out of the park.\n\nIn Bed 100% Linen Sheets\n\nFrom $140 for a twin fitted sheet. Another great company with a focus on linens—and yes, as their name suggests, initially bed linens—In Bed’s pre-washed linen flat sheets are basically made for Pin-spiring bed situations. Ever kept your mattress on the floor next to a stack of books? These babies are calling your name.\n\nFlat Sheets, Linge Particulier\nLinen Flat Sheet, In Bed\n\nLibeco Santiago Collection Bed Linens\n\nFrom $185 for a twin fitted sheet. Luxe? Yes. But worth it? So worth it. With a company history spanning 150 years, Libeco's craft has been passed down for generations. Not to mention that sustainable production is core to their mission.\n\nGarnet Hill Washed Sateen Bedding\n\nFrom $48 for a twin fitted sheet. Available in five on-trend colors, Garnet Hill’s garment-washed sateen bedding is just like a messy updo—low-maintenance in the best way possible.\n\nSantiago Sheets, Liberco Home\nSateen Sheets, Garnet Hill\n\nFrette Single Ajour Sheets\n\nFrom $475 for a queen set.\nMade in Italy of extra long-staple Egyptian cotton, this is the kind of sheet set probably best suited to people who don’t make their own beds. But for the avowedly fancy, Frette linens are an absolute must.\n\nSociety Nite Bed Sheet\n\nFrom $350 for a flat sheet.\nSomewhere in between sateen and percale sheeting, Society’s covetable cotton bedding is low-key glamorous—machine washable and no need to iron. Plus, it’s available in a range of cool colors that both sexes are sure to love.\n\nAjour Sheet Set, Frette\nNite Sheet, Society Limonata\n\nParachute Percale Sheet Set\n\nFrom $50 for for a twin flat sheet. Made in Italy of long-staple Egyptian cotton, Parachute’s affordable, machine-washable sheeting is calling your name when simplicity is key.\n\nFlaneur Sateen Sheets\n\nFrom $400 for a queen set. Flaneur’s Supima cotton sateen sheets are dyed to order in Los Angeles, creating a family of uniquely rich hues to choose from. That’s not the only detail worth noting—corners are specially mitered for a more polished-looking bed (without the effort), plus they use biodegradable sewing thread and a Swiss-engineered zipper. They're the Apple Watch of bedding.\n\nPercale Sheets, Parachute Home\nSateen Sheets, Flaneur\n\nDo you prefer linen, cotton, sateen sheets—or another kind? Tell us in the comments.",
