We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card, you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nWe are in the midst of a price war between Los Angeles (LAX) and Hong Kong (HKG), thanks to a new player coming to the route — and it’s already making an impact. Hong Kong Airlines launches transpacific service between the two cities in December, but will drop its price to just $427 round-trip in January. This has led to both American Airlines and Air Canada dropping their fares to match. When airlines compete, travelers win.\n\nTo be sure, Hong Kong Airlines isn’t exactly a budget carrier. You’ll get free carry-on bags and two free checked bags; even better, you’ll be flying on a brand new Airbus A350-900 (which was just delivered today).
