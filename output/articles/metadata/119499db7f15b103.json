Let’s walk through how to set-up your Priority Pass account for digital use.\n\nFirst, you’re going to need your physical Priority Pass card and know your Priority Pass membership expiration date to complete the digital setup. If you don’t have access to both of these, you can call Chase via the number on the back of your card.
