Per triennial data from the US Federal Reserve published this week, people with college degrees these days have a median net worth more than four times that of people without. “Shares of income and wealth held by affluent families have reached historically high levels,” the Fed wrote in its report.\n\nIt’s not that college-educated Americans are making dramatically more money than before—in fact, their median net worth has only grown 2% between 2013 and 2016—but rather that those without college degrees still have a long way to go to catch up. In that three-year period for which Fed data was collected, the median net worth for those with only a high school diploma actually jumped around 25%, from $54,100 to $67,100.

Of course there’s no panacea—but a combination of government policy programs pledging free or reduced college tuition, university-led initiatives to make degrees more accessible to a wider population, and shifts in employers’ hiring priorities could all help.
