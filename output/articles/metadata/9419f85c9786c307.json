    "selection": "White women voters disapprove of President Donald Trump’s job performance, but nonetheless view him more favorably than other voters — showing that even as a large Trump-era gender gap seems to have opened up, gender remains a less significant marker of political behavior than race and ethnicity or even age.\n\nTracking polling from Civiqs available online makes it easy to examine Trump’s approval rating among demographic subgroups of registered voters and illustrate the point.\n\nTrump famously won a majority of white women’s votes in 2016, but he is currently unpopular with this group.\n\n        Civiqs\n\nIt’s important to note, however, that Trump was unpopular on Election Day.
