Niantic now says the game will enter a beta phase “very soon.”\n\nNiantic also says it’s building “new forms of gaming” for both smartphones and AR glasses, although the company did not elaborate on exactly what headsets from which companies it may be building for. “Currently, we have more than 10 new games in development including prototypes for AR wearables, each with unique and innovative gameplay, centered around outdoor exploration, movement and social interaction,” the company says.\n\nIn December 2019, Qualcomm announced it was working with Niantic on a smart glasses reference design as part of the chipmaker’s Snapdragon XR2 platform.
