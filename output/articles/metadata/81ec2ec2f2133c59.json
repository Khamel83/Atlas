    "selection": "So you came out of the holidays with a fancy new 4K TV? It doesn’t get much better than that. After managing to unbox it and finding the perfect spot in your living room to put it, the next crucial step is downloading the right apps that can showcase that big screen.\n\nThe easiest, fastest way to locate these apps is to open the app store on your TV — whether it be a Roku TV, Samsung TV, LG, Sony, Vizio, or something else — and look for a list of the most popular downloads. You’ll likely spot many of the choices that I’ve included below right there. If your TV comes with a voice remote, you can also look for them that way.\n\nNote that not all of these apps will be available on every smart TV. The best way to maximize your content selection is to buy a set-top box such as a Roku Premiere, Fire TV Stick 4K, or Apple TV 4K. (For complete information on how to choose which hardware you need for which apps, check out The Verge Cord Cutter’s Guide: Hardware, Software, and Services.)\n\nI’ve divided the list into several categories: “TV Everywhere” apps, which are associated with traditional cable stations; TV streaming services, which are an alternative to cable; and standalone, specialized apps.\n\nWe’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used apps, games, and utilities. Look for our picks for iPhones, PCs, and Mac; our favorite games for iOS and Android, and our top choices for the PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch.\n\nTV Everywhere apps\n\nThese are apps that require a cable account login to get the most from them. If you want to watch full-length episodes, you’ll have to sign in. Most major cable networks have their own app.\n\nThere’s nothing necessarily better about watching your programs via these standalone apps versus just pulling up the on-demand options for these channels on your cable box. But if you prefer to keep things separated or hate your cable interface, they’re a nice option to fall back on. I’ve listed them here along with the services where they’re available.\n\nNote that many of these apps now accept login credentials from DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other OTT TV providers such as FuboTV.\n\nA&E Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nABC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nAMC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBBC America Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBET Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nCBS Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nComedy Central Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nThe CW Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nE!
