In marketing, it can uncover the Instagram influencers who are best positioned to sell a company’s product.\n\nBut social network theory—the study of how different people or things interact with one another, often revealing the most influential and well-connected people among a certain population—can also, unexpectedly, explain the entire history of popular music.\n\nQuartz recently highlighted the musicians who affect our lives the most by looking at the artists whose work has influenced the most number of other artists, using information supplied by online music database AllMusic. Here are the top 25:\n\nDigging deeper, we can get even more profound insights into the trajectory of popular music by looking at measures outside of direct influence.\n\nFor instance, one simple measure is how much an artist has influenced multiple “generations.” The following chart combines musicians’ number of direct influences with the number of artists that those people have in turn influenced; think of the musicians topping the list as the “grandparents” of pop music, inspiring singers and songwriters decades down the line. Looking at the data this way, rock pioneers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard rise in the rankings.\n\nTo go even further, we can also look at the artists that serve as the connectors amongst other artists—a term known as “betweenness centrality.” This measures, essentially, the artists that would be most frequently brought up in a game of six degrees of separation. The artists that jump the most in the rankings by this metric are James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Michael Jackson, and Frank Zappa.\n\nMatthew Denny, a social network analysis researcher at Penn State University, explains the stylistic pattern behind these numbers: “A high betweenness centrality suggests you were more important in passing on traditions. Also, someone who created their own branch of music would score higher by this metric.” James Brown, for example, was influenced by early blues, rock, and jazz musicians and went on to inspire a generation of funk and hip-hop artists. His central place in music history stems from his role as a conduit for a range of musical traditions.\n\nBetweenness Centrality Ranking\n\nRank\n\nArtist\n\nChange in rank vs. direct influence\n\n1\n\nThe Beatles\n\n=\n\n2\n\nBob Dylan\n\n=\n\n3\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\n+5\n\n4\n\nMiles Davis\n\n+8\n\n5\n\nJames Brown\n\n+12\n\n6\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n-3\n\n7\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\n+9\n\n8\n\nBrian Eno\n\n+5\n\n9\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nThe Velvet Underground\n\n-4\n\n11\n\nKraftwerk\n\n+4\n\n12\n\nElvis Presley\n\n+11\n\n13\n\nStevie Wonder\n\n+16\n\n14\n\nSonic Youth\n\n=\n\n15\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\n-4\n\n16\n\nPrince\n\n+15\n\n17\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\n-12\n\n18\n\nPink Floyd\n\n+4\n\n19\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\n+8\n\n20\n\nNeil Young\n\n-13\n\n21\n\nThe Clash\n\n-2\n\n22\n\nDuke Ellington\n\n+14\n\n23\n\nMichael Jackson\n\n+30\n\n24\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\n+9\n\n25\n\nFrank Zappa\n\n+33\n\nAnother measure commonly used in social network analysis is “closeness centrality”: how many steps it would take for one person to reach all the other people in a given population.
