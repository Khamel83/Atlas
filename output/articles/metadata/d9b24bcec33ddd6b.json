Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter, and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @tpg_alerts.\n\nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using The Platinum Card® from American Express, you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nNow’s a great time to plan your fall (technically spring) getaway to the South Pacific. Qantas and Virgin Australia are currently offering flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to major cities in Australia and New Zealand, such as Auckland (AKL), Brisbane (BNE) and Sydney (SYD), from $707 round-trip.
