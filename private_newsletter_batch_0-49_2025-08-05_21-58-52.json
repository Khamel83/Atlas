It has to go beyond the zeitgeist.\"</p><p>\"All learning requires us to suffer an injury to our self-esteem.\"</p><p>Going forward, I plan on releasing a few of these per week.

The company derived ~76% (or ~$166.9mm) of its FY24 revenue (~$219.6mm) from Personal Genome Service (“PGS”) offerings – the one-trick pony of hocking a loogie into a test tube, slapping that puppy in the mail, and waiting a few weeks for the debtors to serve up a breakdown of your ancestry. In a nutshell, that’s the problem with the entire business; there’s no recurring demand, and competition from others, along with first-day faves COVID, inflation, and increased costs, only made matters worse. Most of the rest of that revenue ⬆️ comes from the debtors’ plain vanilla telehealth platform </span><strong>Lemonaid</strong><span>, coming in at a sweet ~16% (~$35.1mm), with the ~8% balance (~$17.6mm) deriving from research services, largely through a now-done-and-dusted deal with a </span><strong>GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) </strong><span>affiliate.*</span></p><p>So what’s new since our prior updates? For one, in a none-too-surprising move, employee count is down yet again, to ~286 as of the petition date, a ~20% fall from November ‘24’s already-decimated headcount of ~359.** For another, on March 21, 2025, the debtors executed settlement agreements addressing various litigation claims stemming from their cyber-security breach for $37.5mm all-in. Just in time for bankruptcy too: the debtors executed the definitive docs on March 21, 2025, three days before the petition date.</p><p><span>On governance, the debtors appointed </span><strong>Thomas Walper</strong><span>, formerly of </span><strong>Munger Tolles &amp; Olson LLP</strong><span>, to their board and special committee, where he rounds out the latter’s membership at four, alongside November ‘24 appointees </span><strong>Mark Jensen</strong><span>, </span><strong>Andre Fernandez</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Jim Frankola</strong><span>, and will undoubtedly provide substantial insight into the committee’s “</span><em>special review</em><span>” of claims against directors, officers, equity holders, and “</span><em>other</em><span>” company insiders.</span></p><p><span>And we already said this is a sale case, so turning to that, there’s, lol, no stalking horse. Even though the debtors began soliciting third-party interest back in January ‘25, engaging with 103 potential counterparties and executing 42 NDAs, and only received a single offer – from then-CEO and still-board-member </span><strong>Anne Wojcicki</strong><span> – that provided for an out-of-court solution, they couldn’t line one up. Oh, why “</span><em>then-CEO</em><span>”? Because on the petition date, Ms. Wojcicki clocked out from the company’s employ to focus on buying it back.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/09c708de-7943-4f9b-a9cc-4547a8a4cb34?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3777da4f-f872-4937-99f2-77f9ac8c7bf2_584x1094.png\"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b4d9d94b-0778-470c-b862-81b68ce6fae0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">@annewoj23</a><span> on X</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Her enthusiasm was not shared, lol: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/651c15eb-7bad-4f60-a9d7-df55f222ab03?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e852fe8-c715-4109-bc08-eb025e81dc5e_534x314.png\"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/57d9ba9b-1008-48b8-b5c9-e6b8cc5ed6ee?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">@digijordan </a><span>on X</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Anyway, CFO </span><strong>Joseph Selsavage </strong><span>replaced Ms. Wojcicki as interim CEO and President, while </span><strong>Alvarez &amp; Marsal North America, LLC</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Matthew Kvarda </strong><span>is serving as CRO.</span></p><p>While we wait to see what Ms. Wojcickis’ next bid looks like, we can’t help but notice her prior offer of 41¢ per share and contingent value rights of up to $2.53 is looking more appealing by the minute.

Unsurprisingly, Ms. Wojcicki tossed in an undisclosed proposal for that too, but the special committee opted for </span><strong>JMB Capital Partners Lending, LLC</strong><span>’s (“JMB”) term sheet, which provides for a $35mm senior secured term loan.****** But because the debtors aren’t pulling up to St. Louis on fumes (not yet anyway — almost half of the debtors’ cash on hand will be burned on pro fees between the petition date and June 6), they’re not seeking immediate funding. Instead, court approval to flip the term sheet into definitive documentation sufficed. Approval of the term sheet paid out a $100k work fee and $700k commitment fee, equal to 2% of the total commitments, to JMB, while the second-day hearing will bring the definitive docs and, if approved, an immediate injection of $10mm, with the remaining $25mm locked up until the court approves a stalking horse agreement that either pays JMB off in full or has its support. Why that condition? Because Ms. Wojcicki’s 41¢ offer would have paid $12.1mm in current cash, and JMB definitively doesn’t want to get left holding the bag. The DIP will carry a 14% cash-pay interest rate and, in addition to those other fees, a 4% exit fee is doled out at each stage of funding, which should provide a nice return under a budget that forecasts getting (barely) through the sale with cash on hand and, therefore, zero DIP draws.</span></p><p><span>The debtors’ first-day hearing went forward on March 26, 2025, at which the court granted all requested relief and scheduled a second-day hearing on April 22, 2025. Despite stretching nearly 3.5 hours, the hearing went about as smoothly as it could under the circumstances, with most drawn-out discussion coming from those government lawyers noted above, as well as plaintiffs’ lawyers who didn’t like the debtors’ attempt to make them sub-agents of </span><strong>Kroll </strong><span>by forcing them to forward, through court order, documents to their clients. That got hashed out by removing the language in toto, but can’t blame ‘em for trying.</span></p><p><span>No doubt an unsecured creditors’ committee will force itself into the conversation before long, and we hear rumblings that an equity committee isn’t out of the question.

K&amp;E is frustrated as sh*t. It was damn near palpable every time Mr. Sussberg and Ms. Greenblatt spoke. They’ve tried every logical approach, including inviting “</span><em>principals and advisors of both lender groups for an in-person settlement discussion at K&amp;E in New York on February 28, 2025</em><span>” to no avail. The ad hoc group of first lien lenders (the “ad hoc group”), represented by</span><strong> Paul Hastings LLP </strong><span>(Jayme Goldstein, Daniel Fliman, Jeremy Evans, Isaac Sasson, Nicholas Bassett), showed up. But the Freedom Lender Group? They had better sh*t to do apparently and didn’t make it, although Mr. Lauria tried to explain that away with this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“There was confusion on our end regarding the logistics and ultimately based on the large gap between the various positions, my clients concluded that it was not worth their time to fly cross country for a meeting that they felt was very unlikely to result in anything constructive.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>So was it confusion? Or that you weren’t going to get to a deal? Because we checked, and confusion aside, there are at least 22 </span><em>direct </em><span>flights per day from Los Angeles and Newport Beach, CA (where Freedom Lender Group members </span><strong>Irradiant Partners, LP</strong><span> and </span><strong>Pacific Investment Management Company LLC</strong><span> are based) to NYC, so getting there shouldn’t have been the issue regardless of when that “confusion” cleared up. </span></p><p><span>Listen y’all, you should listen to the audio — it’s that good and you can find it </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cc66ce78-0a57-4ff2-a03c-729f899b67bf?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">here</a><span>. But because you’re going to ignore us, here’s the gist.</span></p><p><span>📍Fed up with lack of progress, the debtors intend to break the “</span><em>logjam</em><span>” by having the OpCo debtors’ independent directors cut a deal directly with the HoldCo independent and file a 9019 motion on an expedited timeline, reserving the right to do the same for the plan voting deadline. As Mr. Sussberg bluntly put it, “</span><em>It's really not that complicated at the end of the day. The numbers pretty much speak for themselves.</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>📍That deal will likely result in the settlement of claims as between the OpCo and HoldCo debtors, with causes of action to be dropped into a single litigation trust and allocations to be resolved at a later time by a trust advisory board, with representation for GUCs and the official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”), whose counsel is </span><strong>Pachulski Stang Ziehl and Jones LLP</strong><span> (Robert Feinstein, Alan Kornfeld, Theodore Heckel, Bradford Sandler, Colin Robinson).</span></p><p><span>📍The settlement would also provide for all but a sliver of the equity to go to the first lien lenders, with that sliver reserved for the 2Ls (93% of whom are part of the Freedom Lender Group). To boot, the 2Ls would receive warrants based on </span><strong>Greenhill &amp; Co. Inc.</strong><span>’s expert valuation report and a juicy cash payment for peace and to stop the admin burn.

It is the effort of disgruntled out of the money creditors, whose only hope at a recovery is to make these bankruptcy cases as long and expensive as possible in the hopes that, faced with mounting legal fees and delay, the First Lien Group will pay their ransom to make them go away.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>We know that the plan retains claims against the Freedom Lender Group and their clients and and their members, right? Barring the potential resolution, they will not be released. And so the party should expect that barring a deal, when we get to confirmation, there will be claims against the Freedom Lender Group and their members, including claims for the payments they received prior to the bankruptcy, including for the conduct undertaken during the bankruptcy, including for the role in the take private transaction. All of these will be retained and will be pursued. So very critically, Your Honor, even though the Freedom Lender Group does not care about the legal fees being expended by the estate, and they probably view this as house money at this point, they should definitely realize that by now, they're exposing themselves not to a free option, but potential risk if this goes forward.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>With each day that goes by, with each one of these hearings we have, and with each day, you have the debtors working towards trial, you've got the committee, you've got us working towards trial.

So the debt’s all over the place, which is one of the bigger issues in the cases, but we’re not there yet.</span></p><p>Turning to the business, the debtors have three, IP-based primary assets:</p><p><span>📍Library Assets. First, there’s a film library consisting of 108 feature films (the “library assets”) of which 91 were developed through co-financing and co-production agreements between the debtors and </span><strong>Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. ($WBD) </strong><span>(“WB”). All in, the library assets generate ~$50mm in revenue per year.</span></p><p><span>📍Derivative Assets. Second, the debtors also own derivative rights attached to their library assets (the “derivative assets”). Essentially, they provide payment rights for derivative productions, like sequels and prequels, based on successful movies, but unlike the library assets, the value is simultaneously “</span><em>more difficult to concretely ascertain</em><span>” but “</span><em>have historically brought monumental value</em><span>” to the debtors. (</span><strong>PETITION Note: keep that vague phrasing in mind as you make your way down</strong><span>).</span></p><p><span>📍Studio Business. Third, the debtors’ own a studio business, their newest venture, that launched in ‘18. Since then, it’s </span><em>developed</em><span> 99 feature films, 67 unscripted TV series, and 166 scripted TV series for the tidy sum of $47mm. Of those 322 ventures, you wanna take a guess at how many made it to production? It was THIRTEEN: six films, five unscripted TV series, and two scripted TV series. $3.6mm a pop. Damn near impossible to be profitable or sustain a new business in the industry on those numbers, and of course, the debtors didn’t, so we’ll peg the value of that one at </span><em>nada</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>But the failed studio business isn’t the only reason the debtors hopped the redeye from sunny SoCal to Delaware. No, they also have COVID (of course), the ‘23 writers’ and actors’ strikes, and “</span><em>streaming wars</em><span>” (i.e., getting beat down by </span><strong>Netflix ($NFLX)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Hulu</strong><span>, </span><strong>Disney+ ($DIS)</strong><span>, etc.) to blame.</span></p><p><span>Oh, and recall that WB relationship ⬆️? Yeah, that’s some sour sh*t now. Under the WB co-financing and co-production agreements, the debtors had a right to co-own and co-finance future works derived from shared assets. However, per </span><strong>Accordion Partners LLC</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Keith Maib</strong><span>, the debtors’ </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4adadf1a-e0eb-4782-b567-a227b71f58c7?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">first day declarant</a><span> and CRO, WB froze them out entirely, and it got nasty enough that the debtors filed a complaint on February 7, 2022 to thaw those rights out, which also raised, of all things, a claim relating to the “day-and-date release”*** of </span><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em><span> on WB-owned </span><strong>HBO Max</strong><span>.

Johnny after wasting two hours. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In any event, the court kicked the complaint to a super secret, confi arbitration where it belonged all along under the agreements, so we can’t dish on the drama that unfolded there (😢). But that’s not to say we know nothing because WB wasn’t all-in on Mr. Maib’s dec and sent </span><strong>O’Melveny &amp; Myers LLP</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Steve Warren</strong><span> to the March 18, 2025 first-day hearing to fire some undodgeable truth bullets. Here’s him laying it out for the court:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The dispute between the parties grows out of the Matrix franchise: Matrix Resurrections. That was a co-financing arrangement. We had understood that Village had committed to co-finance. Based on that reliance on that commitment, Warner spent $200mm to produce the film, $100mm to market it, and then Village did not step forward and provide the co-financing. That’s led to a years’ long arbitration that’s gone on for quite a bit.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>We very much contest, I know you won’t be surprised to hear, some of the characterizations of the redacted section [of the first day declaration] regarding what happened in the arbitration. And I can share some other facts with you … Liability’s already been determined. The arbitrators have already decided that Village breached its obligations with respect to the Matrix projects. That's done. All that's left is to determine the damages. Again, with respect to the public record, I can tell you Warner took the position at the inception of the dispute that it was approximately $100mm, maybe even more, and that number hasn’t gone down.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>LOL, yeah, doesn’t seem like anybody’s being frozen out now, does it? Mr. Warren also didn’t like another thing, the debtors’ ‘24 “</span><em>bifurcation</em><span>” of assets. Mr. Maib barely mentions it, and only in connection with the prepetition marketing process. We’ll let him speak for himself first:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“During the first half of 2024, Goldman marketed a sale of the equity in the Company, seeking to sell the business as a going concern. While the Company received meaningful interest and entered exclusivity with a potential purchaser, the unknown outcome of the WB Arbitration ultimately stifled the ability to close the transaction. Thereafter, Goldman continued to market the Company and its assets – in whole or in part – to a broad array of potential purchasers. It became evident following negotiations with potential purchasers that the Company may receive the highest value for its assets by bifurcating them: the Library Assets as a distinct and high value asset, and the Derivative Rights and the Studio Business (together with the Library Assets, the “Business Segments”), which attach to greater liability.”****</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s it. No other references in the doc. Before we go back to Mr. Warren, we’ll highlight that the entities subject to WB’s arbitration claim are the four outlined in red in the bottom-right quadrant of the chart. You printed it out, right? Okay, have at it, Mr. Warren:</p><blockquote><p><em>“After Warner Brothers succeeded in establishing liability in the arbitration, the derivative assets were moved out of entities that were obligors, our obligors, part of ours, into newly-created special purpose entities for a dollar, for a dollar a piece. These are rights that Village had taken the position that were worth quite a lot of money, and for a dollar, they transferred them out and then we subsequently found out that those new entities guaranteed and pledged those derivative rights, which could not have been pledged under the agreements with Warner up to the parent’s debt. And we’ve taken the position that the transactions were fraudulent transfers, and we’ve taken the position that the pledges were fraudulent, intentional or constructively fraudulent transfers.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Hot damn, break out the 🍿; we love first-day fraudulent transfer flicks — we’re already stoked for the second-day sequel. Mr. Warren’s also got thoughts on the debtors’ proposed DIP, which is being provided by the senior noteholders of those newco SPVs, </span><strong>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board</strong><span> and </span><strong>Falcon Investment Advisors LLC</strong><span>, because it includes an all-debtor roll-up of what was ~$5.8mm in prepetition bridge financing. Debt that his entities are not currently liable on. But that only comes on entry of the final order, so it’ll either be resolved ahead of the April 11, 2025 second day hearing or be the subject of a brawl then.</span></p><p><span>The DIP’s otherwise a $12.8mm term loan, apropos enough in term sheet form,***** composed of $7mm in new money ($500k interim) and that roll-up ☝️. It carries a delectable 16% interest rate, a 3% commitment fee, earned on the petition date, and a 2% exit fee on the new money, earned on funding, and has priority over everything except the ABS notes with respect to their collateral (ergo, Mr. Warren’s beef). The DIP also had a “</span><em>novel</em><span>” feature: a transaction support agreement (“TSA”) attached, which the debtors tried to get the court to bless on the first day.</span></p><p><span>Who’s it with?

Disney Inc. ($DIS) absolutely besmirched their precious Star Wars IP, not to mention the recent wave of completely unnecessary and insufferable Marvel fare. Game of Thrones failed to stick the landing. All of the recent Lord of the Rings fare has been hot trash. And, man, this Matrix movie. Cynical hot garbage designed purely to take advantage of our collective love of nostalgia. The reviews featured above are, frankly, far too kind. The only properties that have stuck the landing are anything with Tom Cruise and Cobra Kai. Convince us otherwise.</h5><h5>**If you saw that formation date, immediately thought “fraudulent transfer,” and skipped down here to confirm, congrats, you’re today’s lucky winner!</h5><h5>***A “day-and-date release” means a flick is released on multiple platforms on the same day, bypassing the typical theater-only process, and is also known as the much-more straightforward “simultaneous release.” Unnecessary industry jargon, 🙄.</h5><h5><span>****Around early ‘24, the debtors engaged </span><strong>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ($GS)</strong><span> to lead a sale process, which ground to a halt by the end of the year on account of the debtors’ “</span><em>dire</em><span>” financial distress. Goldman was sacked in favor of SOLIC Capital Advisors, LLC in February ‘25 as the debtors were booking their flights to Wilmington (well, Philly).</span></h5><h5><span>*****The whole case may not get a DIP credit agreement. Per the term sheet, “</span><em>[i]f requested by the DIP Lenders, then the Debtors agree to enter into a credit agreement with the DIP Lenders on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in this DIP Term Sheet.</em><span>”</span></h5><h5>******That said, WB ain’t keen on letting secured claims creep into its debtor boxes, so they’re going to fight the roll-up all the same. Then, of course, there’s the whole fraudulent transfer litigation about those derivative assets being dumped into newly-formed SPVs.</h5><h3><strong>📚Resources📚</strong></h3><p><span>We have compiled a list of a$$-kicking resources on the topics of restructuring, tech, finance, investing, and disruption. 💥</span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2b3e3125-b424-4106-80ab-8aa4485ea219?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">You can find it here</a></strong><span>💥. </span></p></div>",

Mitochondria is — say it with me now — the powerhouse of the cell! They are tiny structures in cells that turn food into energy, making them essential for everything your body and brain does.</p><p>The research team used spatial transcriptomics (study of RNA) and proteomics (study of protein) to analyze 703 brain samples, measuring both gene activity and protein levels related to mitochondria. They combined this with microscopy to count actual mitochondria and assessed the expression of over 1,000 mitochondrial genes. By layering this data onto a 3D model of the brain, they created a detailed energy map (see above) showing how mitochondrial density and function vary by region and cell type.</p><p>The study found that newer, more complex parts of the brain—like those involved in thinking and planning—have more mitochondria and more efficient energy use than older brain regions. Mitochondrial activity also varied by cell type, with neurons generally showing higher energy needs than support cells. The findings show that energy production is closely tied to brain function and evolution. </p><p>While this is generally useful to map out and know, it’s particularly helpful in understanding why certain parts of the brain are more prone to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how energy maps through the brain could aid the development of treatments for things like Parkinson’s and Alzheimers. </p><p><em>From OpenAI</em></p><blockquote><p><em>At OpenAI, we have long believed image generation should be a primary capability of our language models. That’s why we’ve built our most advanced image generator yet into GPT‑4o. The result—image generation that is not only beautiful, but useful.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cf8173f7-68d5-4388-9ca9-f80935c4ab36?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_322,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff548b45f-dcb0-43fe-bbfe-fa5ce66def25_800x1200.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>Unless your wifi’s been offline for the past 48 hours, you’ve probably noticed the flood of AI-generated images—many in Studio Ghibli style—taking over the internet. That’s because OpenAI added advanced image generation functionality to its 4o model.</p><p>OpenAI’s new image generation now allows users to edit images directly with text prompts (the inability to do this previously was a huge pain) and generate images within chat, making the whole process generally more flexible and enjoyable. And importantly, the image generation is just better: more accurate, detailed, and reflective of the actual prompt.</p><p>Tough to say exactly how this will change the world or media or whatever, but as a very real first use case, marketers have taken to vibe marketing. No more spending thousands of dollars on designers to sketch up static image Meta ads. Just upload a template, some pictures of your product/brand, and prompt the model to generate new ads for you. Who knows if that type of creative will ultimately be rewarded by Meta, but it is an example of a decades old workflow being potentially disrupted by an OpenAI model upgrade.</p><p><span>In the meantime, while we watch that play out, enjoy the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/076142e6-449b-4172-92c8-501a82ac853f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Ghiblification happening on X</a><span>. </span></p><p><em>Brian Potter for Construction Physics</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Looking at the backgrounds of Nobel Prize winners can tell us about where some of the best scientific work is being done, and the sort of people and institutions that are doing it.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ecd0a1fa-b9df-442d-b705-588087a5f5a7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31a9f872-759d-4f75-b8ab-7b3579e3ca7f_1464x1003.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>Brian Potter, the writer of one of our favorite Substacks, </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/272a1414-256b-46c8-b5b3-aece9c3bb3c2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Construction Physics</a></strong><span>, did an in-depth analysis of Nobel Prizes to better understand how and where scientific breakthroughs occur. The whole piece is worth a read but here were the main takeaways:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Scientific output is concentrated:</strong><span> A small number of universities (Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia) produce a large share of Nobel-winning research.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Geographic dominance:</strong><span> The US leads in Nobel-winning work post-WWII; UK and Germany out-punch their weight.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Labs are getting more important:</strong><span> Most prizes stem from academia, though government and private labs are growing in influence.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Recognition lags:</strong><span> Time between discovery and Nobel award has doubled (from ~10 to ~25 years), even though breakthrough work still occurs around age 40.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Progress may be slowing:</strong><span> Fewer transformative discoveries—or delayed recognition—could signal a scientific slowdown in Nobel fields.</span></p></li></ul><p>Potter doesn’t necessarily offer any solutions for increasing the rate of scientific breakthroughs based on his analysis. However, it certainly seems to me that the consolidation of knowledge and resources under powerful institutions — whether it’s nations, universities, or government/private labs — has historically led to more scientific breakthroughs. It makes me wonder how the erosion of trust in these types of institutions could impact scientific breakthroughs in the future. </p><p>The past is certainly not predictive of the future — distributed scientific work is certainly more possible today than it was in the 1950s — but these historical trends do call into question what the proper balance of institutionalized and distributed opportunity is for scientific innovation. </p><p><em>Kiel Porter and Loren Grush for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The billionaire who was behind the infamous Mt.

Even better when that wealth isn’t just tech wealth, but crypto wealth. Made billions on magic internet money?

And he’s investing about 1/3rd of that money into building Vast.</p><p>Vast is aiming to build the first commercial space station, called Haven-1. The goal is to eventually replace the aging ISS and the plan is generally in-line with NASA push to privatize low-Earth orbit infrastructure. The company is growing very quickly: it now has over 700 employees, is closely partnered with SpaceX, and is planning to launch its first station in 2026.</p><p>Turning XRPs into ISSs — that’s a winning trade for society. </p><p><em>Dan Carlin on Common Sense</em></p><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png\"></div><img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ad08e93668498337c12532b85\"><p>Show 324 - What's Good for the Goose</p><p>Dan Carlin</p><p>Episode</p><p><span>You’ve likely heard of </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/00d0cf66-f4f0-4790-8589-6b2461837b4a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Hardcore History</a><span>, the absolutely epic history podcast series from Dan Carlin.

Which is to say, Dan really picks his spots these days.</span></p><p>I greatly respect Dan' Carlin’s political perspectives: he’s read just about as much history as anyone, he’s extremely non-partisan, and fiercely independent. He’s also not overly reactive — he looks at things on decades or century long timelines.</p><p>This episode is not necessarily going to leave you feeling optimistic about the future. The whole episode is Carlin ringing the alarm on U.S.’ current political environment.

The idea is really simple. I read a lot of great essays every week and I wanna talk to the people who write them. The topics will be broad. If there's a great essay written on a tech company on the internet in a given week, obviously I wanna talk about it. If there's a great essay written on peeling an orange on the internet that I really, really love, I wanna bring that person on and talk about that essay too.</p><p>To kick things off, I'm discussing the essay that made me wanna do this in the first place, because it's an essay I wanted to write myself, but that my friend Tina wrote better than I possibly could have. I've known Tina for about five years. We met on the internet because I loved her writing. At the time, she worked at a venture capital firm here in New York City called Pace Capital. Then she left to start a company called Station, which I invested in. She sold Station to Coinbase, where she now works on Base, Coinbase's Layer 2.</p><p>While she was out there being an entrepreneur, she stopped writing on one of my favorite blogs on the internet, Fakepixels. Recently, as of February 8th, she's back. Every week since early February, Tina has been writing a different essay on what's going on in the world now that AI is here, I would say. Tina is technical and philosophical and tasteful and thoughtful. And so the pieces are really, really good and really, really unique.</p><p><span>Last week she dropped an essay titled,</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5c8915af-9026-47b4-a6b7-a4071b3d5a01?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5c8915af-9026-47b4-a6b7-a4071b3d5a01?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Jevons Paradox: A personal perspective</a></em><span>, which was exceptional. It's a better version of a few pieces that I've had kind of just sitting there in drafts, not able to figure out how to do it right. But it addresses the question, like, look, you assume that AI is gonna put us all out of a job and that when AI makes things easier to do, we're all gonna work less. What if the opposite is true? What if the fact that we can do so much more in any given hour with these tools available to us now means that we just have to work more and more and more and more? How do you break out of that? What metrics are the right metrics to track to make sure that we're actually being productive and not just spinning our wheels?</span></p><p>And most importantly, how do you figure out who you are, what you wanna do, and how you wanna experience your life on this earth? So it's a fascinating conversation to start. I'm really excited for Hyperlegible and I hope you enjoy it too.</p><p>Without further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with Tina He.</p><p><strong>Packy (02:25)</strong></p><p>Tina, tell me about your personal perspective on Jevon's paradox.</p><p><strong>Tina He (02:30)</strong></p><p>So for those of you that might not be familiar, Jevons paradox is this kind of re-emerging word in the world of venture and just tech in general to understand kind of valuation of stocks like Nvidia and whether, you the kind of increase in capabilities and compute is actually gonna drive potentially cost down and potentially make the resource way too abundant in a kind of purely economic sense. But in reality, Jevons paradox kind of stated that it actually will only increase demand when you have more resources.</p><p>And that actually was inspired first by coal consumption in England when the word was invented which kind of this concept has been in my mind for a bit as people started discussing it again.</p><p>And when I saw this post on, on X that I kind of referenced in my essay where someone kind of tweeted that they're dying of overworking, because now with the overabundance of these amazing AI tools, they just feel like the opportunity cost of not working became skyrocketed, became so high, that every single passing second, almost the opportunity cost now is so high that it's like, he's basically overwhelmed guilt. And that really resonated with me. And I was like, this is basically Jevons Paradox applied to a personal and psychological perspective and probably one of the more impactful kind of psychological looms that's going to just loom over us in this like age of AI. So that's what inspired the piece.</p><p><strong>Packy (03:57)</strong></p><p>It's something that I've been thinking about a lot as we kind of talked about a little bit offline, that there is this just like...</p><p>Why are we doing this? And like the fact that you can work more and more and more, I think makes the question kind of to what end more important and we'll get to that because you address some of that in the essay. my first question though, cause that original Kache tweet where he talks about being overworked and like there's just so many opportunities to build great software and you can build all of these like scripts and you can run them and you just have a folder and like your development gets better and like you can't not do it.</p><p>Like it's just like this panicked thing where like you have to work more and more and more because you can build such great stuff, which leads me to the question like, where is all of the great software? Like my software has not gotten that much better.</p><p><strong>Tina He (04:40)</strong></p><p>I think you are doing a line of work that is like...</p><p>Really, really great. It's like not going to be replaced by AI, I think, anytime soon. You're playing the role of a human curator of knowledge and information. And I do think that that role will continue to become important as we discuss later as this kind curatorial role for condensing and kind of creating the subjective view for information versus just kind of content generation, like from a much more practical sense.</p><p>So to kind of make that more practical, think that like probably you have seen on X and a lot of these platforms, really the biggest kind of adoption comes from code generation And that has a lot of downstream effect because code generation, yes, it's writing software and kind of the most tangible example that we're seeing is, you know, somebody from Paris. Like I follow this guy because he's just cranking out like a B2B SaaS software every single day. And like now he's like basically running a business.</p><p>The last time I checked I think they're doing like five million in revenue already or something like that where he's just using lovable, which is this no code two generation to build B2B software. And actually I've tried, actually took on a client and myself and I just built a B2B software for them. And that's not something I would dare to take on before this, because I wouldn't say I'm a very good software engineer. But now with some basic understanding of software and some taste for design, I'm able to create end-to-end software. And that's like quite literally if you don't do it.</p><p>Like, you know, and it takes so little time like I think it took me end to end probably five to ten hours to deliver this Then it's like basically opportunity costs. So that's like one tangible example but now with like, you know, very rapid development of like previously kind of LLMs and code generation is in this very contained environment where Because LLMs are trained on basically like the knowledge of the web and all the all the basics that I think your audience already know</p><p>like not very capable of generating, for example, code in like Blender or Unity or being able to integrate with third party tools and data sources, at least for amateur. It's like the rag pipeline and there's like all these tools that help you do that are still not like really sophisticated enough to kind of manipulate these third party tools. People that are very sophisticated and pro are able to make it work.</p><p>But recently,Anthropic released this also new standard called MCP that's all over the timeline. It's model context protocol essentially. You can think of it as an API, like an API moment for AI software. And the API moment, what did that enable? I think that previously it was such a shocker to the software community that Lyft And a lot of these really high performing apps were all built with microservices and API and Twilio and whatnot. And that was a huge topic. And people now, they don't think about API anymore, just kind of exist and every company has an API.</p><p><strong>Packy (07:30)</strong></p><p><span>I was just thinking about this that I wrote. I think in 2021 wrote a piece called </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a0d8a648-e68c-4169-b676-8d990322c9c0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">APIs All the Way Down</a></em><span> where I was like, Whoa, like what is an API? This is amazing. You get like the Collisons in your pocket by plugging in Stripe. And now it is like so obvious just four years later that everything runs on, on APIs. So yeah, very interesting.</span></p><p><strong>Tina He (07:36)</strong></p><p>100%. Totally. And that's what's happening with MCP, where now I can use my cloud desktop, which is a consumer experience, to interact with Blender. So there's crazy demos on Twitter where I can say create a CAD like 3D model of this like Eiffel Tower. And it's just going to render in real time in Blender.</p><p>Basically, I think that for someone that is creative, that always wanted to build software end to end, or always wanted to create these kind of digital experiences, a lot of times, which is the beautiful part about software is they were literally not able to because tools are not great enough. They have to hire someone. So now for people with ideas, like you're enabled with basically the full stack team that are probably junior members of the team, but still team members that are able to empower you. So a lot of the software right now are impacting kind of the software creation tools, but over time probably can see downstream effect to more industries as well.</p><p><strong>Packy (08:39)</strong></p><p>So you've kind of updated me on how good these things are now. And I hear myself in some of the like, it's like not that good because it's not perfect there. And so like that makes the problem that you described in the essay in my mind, at least like even worse, like the better these tools get, the more challenging the problem gets.</p><p>You mentioned at some point in the piece, the fact that kind of metrics around like what productivity means or like what being good at work means have evolved over time. and this one to one relationship between capabilities and expectations, it kind of mean we're on this like “limitless treadmill,” I think is the phrase that you used. So how have our metrics evolved and like how do they just kind of keep evolving? Is there any way to catch up and to be like to exceed our own expectations?</p><p><strong>Tina He (09:17)</strong></p><p>Yeah, taking a step back here, I think the most fascinating thing about when I was writing this essay was I think it's so easy for an essay like this to sound critical, to sound like, you know, these technologies are like potentially causing some problems and, you know, make like, get us on this limitless treadmill. But I think maybe one of the kind of more implicit thing that I was trying to get across was basically like these type of game theory or you know, labor market dynamics. And I kind of call it Malthusian trap, like of needing to compete in the labor marketplace and be competitive. Like that dynamic actually has always existed in human history. And, and then it's just the reason why it's a Malthusian trap and the reason why, you know, there's a system in place for people to compete. think there's something that's like, it sounds a little bit like, like make me sound like agentic, but at the same time, right? That that's kind of the reason why it's so difficult to, to basically overcome any of these forces because it's the system itself. And I think that's a very important, like,part of the piece is that, you know, this is the dynamics and what do we like, what can we do to, kind of live with this dynamics? Because it's not like if we wave a magic wand or we try to practically solve the problem, like the problem will go away. I don't even know if it's a problem. It's just a thing that's happening. And yeah.</p><p><strong>Packy (10:34)</strong></p><p>Yeah. I mean like this is what I loved about the piece so much is that I like I wrote a draft of something not nearly as good but similar ish and it did come across as kind of critical or like, you we talked about lovable and I think it's like amazing and I think the fact that like these companies are growing so quickly is unbelievable that feels like another one of these Malthusian traps or it's like well, you know, maybe actually like some sustainable growth and like kind of like being a little more subtle in the beginning so you don't attract a bunch of competitors like might be competitively advantageous over time.</p><p>But now in this market like good luck raising for an AI product if you're not making $12 million in your first month. And so everyone kind of has to get on that treadmill and it's nobody's fault and people are acting rationally and yet the overall system might not be optimal. It's one of the most interesting dynamics I think in your piece.</p><p><strong>Tina He (11:20)</strong></p><p>Totally, exactly. And back to your question about metrics, I think one thing that I was thinking about is like, a lot of my friends recently kind of resorted to becoming farmers after they made enough money and they wanted to retire like some exit founder or like some hedge fund person that like wanted to leave. And I was like, yeah, you know, planting vegetables and growing fruits, right? Those were legitimate professions in the past and now they've become a status symbol of leisure.</p><p>So like how we define and how we perceive work is also evolving. Like can imagine maybe in the future, right, writing software is something that people perceive as like a profession. It's because people use the word vibe coding and it's because vibe coding I think is the perfect brand for what's happening now with these no code tooling is because it's legitimately pretty fun. Like if you are a software nerd, of course, and then like you like building games and software maybe as a kid and you just didn't have enough skills or just enough resources to do it, like you can now do it with natural language prompts.</p><p>Software writing which was like one of the most reliable sources of I think scarcity and demand I think the demand for that would maybe will only also increase because of some Javon's paradox dynamics at play But then the nature of that work may change right like more software engineers are serious actually no one I talked to actually enjoy especially the really really good one They don't enjoy writing code like on a line-by-line basis.</p><p>Obviously I've met craftsmen that that really do just enjoy that but I think some of them more visionary technical kind of leaders that I've met, they really just enjoy architecturing and designing the system and designing how the entire thing works. And if you ask them to write the entire thing by themselves, and that's why they need junior devs. Then it's actually pretty draining for them. They actually enjoy the higher level part of system design. In the future, all the kind of line by line kind of software engineering or even designing may become almost a craft where no one kind of makes their clothes from scratch anymore.</p><p>When you restore back, then that becomes a hobby and that becomes a leisure activity that people can do. Just build beautiful personal software that you can show up to your friends and make your mom use.</p><p>So I think that's like a very kind of more optimistic and potential to take on how the metric potentially evolves now. I think some companies unironically might be measuring employees by the lines of code they've written, the number of commits that they have.</p><p>I think I've seen somewhere, I'm not gonna reference anybody, but someone kind of showed off their like Cursor bills where it's like, okay, this is like the number of credits that our engineers commit. But to be quite honest, I don't think that, you know, the kind of your Cursor bills probably directly correlated with the number of tokens that, you know.</p><p>you're generating and that actually doesn't signal anything, right? It could just mean that I'm tons of data or like shit into Sursor that led to like this this like really big bill. But then like it looks interesting. It's like like our engineers are super cracked and and they're like, you know writing a lot of code and using AI tools.</p><p>So yeah, and the metrics, yeah, like I mentioned a little bit in the essay, like have always evolved, like, you know, from agrarian society to industrial to information. So given these sets of constraints, some of these metrics become so silly, which I think is a good thing. It makes us really question what actually matters and like, how can we measure success in a different way, which I feel like it's one of the, yeah, yeah, one of the good ways to combat this dynamics.</p><p><strong>Packy (14:41)</strong></p><p>It's weird for me to not be the optimistic one in the conversation, but it seems to me that the metrics get sillier and sillier and sillier and more abstract maybe over time. you talk about the fact that before it's like, can you feed yourself and stay alive? And now it's things like, what is your cursor bill? Do you think without an intervention? Let's just say we stay on this path and we'll get to the interventions.</p><p>Where do you think this goes in the limit? That like we just keep making up harder and harder and harder metrics for ourselves as the things that you talk about kind of happen, productivity breeds new demand, competition intensifies. Like where does it go if we don't do something?</p><p><strong>Tina He (15:17)</strong></p><p>Yeah, I actually this might not come across explicitly in my essay, but actually I do believe these dynamics will accelerate. But then there's ways that you don't have to opt in completely with whatever the system metrics would be to be successful or to do well. So one example, like this dynamics already exists in like our day-to-day marketplace of content as an example, and you're in the business too, where, know, Packy you could be creating every single day, you could be like playing the algorithmic game and like always be on top of other people's But you're choosing not to do that and do play another game that suits your audience. It's what you want to do.</p><p>And defining your own kind of you know algorithmic like optimization frontier I was almost like there's like an efficiency frontier and and like a maximal return point I don't know what what that exact mapping would look like but but my guess is that there's some like productivity gain or like algorithmic gain from playing the game and there's some personal gain on the other axes and then there's probably like an efficiency frontier of like where's the optimal point for you to get the most personal fulfillment but still be able to play with the system and I think everyone just needs to start thinking about their personal kind of efficiency frontier and optimization point in this larger system, but I actually don't know if that acceleration-ism is going to stop existing.</p><p>And people these days are very skeptical or becoming a little bit more cautious of China. But I still pay attention a lot to Chinese tech because I genuinely think that the consumer internet in China is just always a couple months or years ahead in terms of their ability to create this even more capitalistic, ironically, system than the West. And it's almost like a little bit of glimpsing into the future.</p><p>And if you look at this like Little Red Book, which is this alternative platform that people flock to when TikTok was going to get banned in America. I go on that platform probably once a month just for anthropological observation and everything you see on there is about how to make money, how to be rich and how to hack the game of the algorithm. And if you think that content creators here are going out of hand with their podcasts and whatnot on the feed, they're kind of creating 10 content a day.</p><p>Like if you want to get rich, like you have to work this hard. Like if you don't work this hard, like don't even talk to me. Like, and it's like a beautiful woman that's like saying these things. And then like, you know, you can tell her face almost is kind of going through this like algorithmic optimization to be like just capturing it, like captivating enough for people to click into her video and listen to her kind of criticize you for not posting enough. So yeah, yeah, these dynamics I think will always exist. So I think, yeah, back to the point.</p><p>And I think the conclusion of the essay, which I'm sure we'll get to, is like you kind of have to protect your own and design your own efficiency frontier.</p><p><strong>Packy (18:01)</strong></p><p>It does to me seem like a little PVP and like you're dividing this like one pie. There's like, you know, a pool of money and you fight in the algorithm to determine who gets it. But you talk about experimental new ways of measuring that people are working on. You mentioned three of them. What are those three ways that people are kind of thinking about using to determine how they're doing?</p><p><strong>Tina He (18:20)</strong></p><p>Yeah, so generally the three of them, one of them is essentially there's like different countries that are like Switzerland and a couple others. They're like experimenting with like new measurement of wellness index, which I honestly think it's pretty hard to measure.</p><p>I think there's just a lot of bias kind of intrinsic in that type of NPS related metrics but then I do like kind of you know applaud the attempt to have a different metrics than just GDP growth which I think for many of the developing countries and for developed countries that is one of the big benchmark and I think in the US right like we don't really talk about like citizen well-being as much, which I kind of observe as pretty interesting as someone that kind of immigrated here when I was like a teenager.</p><p>I think that in America, it's like the language is very market oriented, which I actually do think it's a feature of the society where all we care about is rates. then like, I think the American population is generally obsessed with a couple numbers that the Fed is obsessed about, like rates, like inflation and debt and these numbers. like, how does that actually impact in a very practical way to an everyday kind of citizen of America?</p><p>I don't think there's anything good or bad about that and I think in America obviously there's also a lot of like long tail communities that value different things. And that's the beauty of the system where if you want to be a Buddhist, if you want to be a monk, if you want to just opt out of the system completely and be a farmer, you can find somebody that does that here. But I'm kind of just portraying the mainstream culture here and obviously and not to be super reductionistic.</p><p>And then in some other countries, like for example, like I know Thailand decently well where yes, like economic development matters, but it's just so clear that people are optimizing for another set of metrics, you know, Material wealth they know it's important but I think that they don't pursue it as the end as much where like it's not as much of a proxy of Success like actually they will everyone there will say that they love money and they want more of them but I think it's actually for the end of enjoyment of life. And if you go there, I think that people just have a much more communal and also convivial sense of like, okay, we're here to have fun, like, life should be fun.</p><p>Versus I do think that it's very interesting where I, when I look at the Nvidia customer list, I think that 60 % of them are like maybe American companies if I remember correctly and then like the next in line is Singapore which is like probably 16 % or something like that and then it's China and then I look at these countries and I was like it makes so much sense and I think there's some correlation here with like how competitive and how basically optimized for these metrics that we're saying here and also sadly kind of their dominance in technology and capitalism because they like explicitly optimize for things that, you know, are kind of have these properties that, you know, is very favorable to the game of capitalism, right? Like they were trying to basically invest in technology for what? For lower, like increasing productivity, lowering cost and producing more things. So, yeah, totally. It works.</p><p><strong>Packy (21:24)</strong></p><p>It works.</p><p>You mentioned time affluence too I really like that that phrase what's time affluence</p><p><strong>Tina He (21:31)</strong></p><p>Yeah, totally. I think that this becomes much more of a cultural phenomena. I think in the recent, I would say decade or so, and now it's becoming even more prominent where there's a concept that like Cal Newport has published a book called Deep Work. And then there's like a class of books, like Four Hour Work Week, or, you know, these like level of like what tech bros read as like the canon of like productivity of being able to like, you know, the underlying message of all these books is like you want to condense.</p><p><strong>Packy (21:53)</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Tina He (21:59)</strong></p><p>And I think everyone recognizes that to some degree. It's very hard to kind of combat against the dynamics of always wanting to work as we discuss in the piece. But I think that, you know, even companies, recognize it where they're trying to basically now forcefully induce because they know that the Malthusian Trap of employees out working each other that is the system level, you know It's not even the company is telling them to work harder.</p><p>But it's because yes, like every year you have a certain amount of allocation for promotion you have a certain amount of allocation for bonus and You know, and then there's no actually probably better system design for that. You can't incentivize workers that work less, right? So I think there's like a limit of what companies can do and then they also recognize that at some point if you burned out as an employee and work too hard like you're productivity curve is going to decrease.</p><p>And that's like the point, which is also kind of mentioned in this Scott Alexander kind of very iconic on Moloch where basically he made a very cynical argument, like companies would not reduce work time because they want to reduce productivity. They would only reduce work time because it actually increases productivity because if you overwork somebody, you would just burn down and stop being like a functional part of the system.</p><p>So that's a very cynical view, but I do think that companies that recognize time affluence as a very critical piece of doing any real creative work is on to something there. And I think that I've only worked at an at scale company at Coinbase. So Coinbase, for example, they do like recharge week, which I find a very interesting concept. Basically in that week, no one is allowed to work. Of course, there's a customer support members and a couple that needs to stay on the line and they will be rewarded for another recharge week. But basically everyone takes off and it's like a mandatory holiday because one of the studies that you probably have seen is like if you give</p><p><strong>Packy (23:39)</strong></p><p>Yep.</p><p><strong>Tina He (23:50)</strong></p><p>employees, unlimited PTOs, then they're just never going to take it off. They don't take it off, which is the fascinating dynamic, right?</p><p><strong>Packy (23:53)</strong></p><p>They don't take it.</p><p><strong>Tina He (24:05)</strong></p><p>Yyeah. So, yeah. So, so basically companies are doing these recharged weekend. We recently had one that I really love. It's called no meetings week.</p><p>So essentially you are empowered, like no matter what level you are, you're empowered to just say no if someone wants to meet with you because you can just say that it's no meetings week, I want to work. So it basically allows people the abundance of time to like work on a hard technical problem. And it's just so hard at like a company of any scale, like even a serious B startup, I bet it's pretty hard to actually get consistent work done unless it's nights and weekends because you're just in meetings all day.</p><p><strong>Packy (24:30)</strong></p><p>Yeah, mean, this, this, all of that speaks so clearly to me that like for a long time when I, when I worked in companies and be like, yeah, weekends are like when you actually get work done. I love going to the office on the weekend. Cause you then you can actually get things done. I've tried to make myself more time affluent this, this year and it's been actually like hard. I tweeted something about this the other day that like I've been meditating more and like giving myself more time to write and not having like the stress and the deadlines is like actually like, think makes me maybe a little bit less creative. So I'm now going back and trying to like jam</p><p><strong>Tina He (24:50)</strong></p><p>Ha</p><p><strong>Packy (24:58)</strong></p><p>more in and we'll see what the right balance is. But yeah, everything that you're saying resonates in a big way. And the third way you talked about measuring it also resonates, which is impact. Can you talk about that one a little bit?</p><p><strong>Tina He (25:09)</strong></p><p>Basically the idea of being able to just measure success in a completely different way, like is I think one of the more impactful ones, compared to even the other two, because the first where it's like you want a wellness index or some type of other, like way of measuring, wellness.</p><p>I think that that is helpful, but I'm worried that it kind of fall into Goodhart’s Law, of like whatever you measure stops working essentially, whatever the goal is, like you stop making progress with the goal when you make that a goal. And the second piece was time affluent, like you said, like I think it's a very individually holistic exercise. And when company kind of impose that on a top down level, I think it's very helpful. But at the same time, the efficacy is also very hard to know given like what are people going to do when they're taking time off?</p><p>Like ideally they're actually taking time off and doing creative work. But I don't think you can just switch the mindset just like that. I think it actually takes probably more than a week to get into the mindset of slow thinking that may produce different levels of work than this rapid back to back meeting type cadence.</p><p>And the last piece, which is a little bit nuanced in the first one, the first bullet point that I mentioned around just like changing the conception of success completely, which is very, very hard to do. And I think that's also like both on a macro level and on a micro level, you need to systematically change something meaningfully.</p><p>So if your goal is to like, you know, get a promotion or to start another company, raise a million dollars, whatever that is, then maybe you have to change that completely and say that I want to read, you know, five books this year. I want to run 10 miles this year. And I think that that has worked out really well for a lot of my friends who are like very type A in our same share industry and maybe have been a successful founder, maybe have like, and after they finished doing that, they have this long loss period of like, now what do I do with my life?</p><p>And I'm not like, you know, momentum is toxic. Like you mentioned, if you're publishing a post every single day and getting this positive feedback, just like all of a sudden, abruptly interrupting that with maybe your meditation retreat, it's going to feel very jarring because you feel like you kind of lost your wind out of your sail. And it's like, what do I now do with my life? And I think that life is like the kind of place that we're in is like, you constantly have to adjust this, like micro game that you're playing with yourself and then like taking a step back and look at a macro and then like maybe you can actually plot yourself in another vector space completely and then move into a very different direction if you want to.</p><p>Obviously you're losing out like you know on maybe some compounding if you just keep moving towards one direction but maybe it's actually very productive where by moving into another direction you see new things completely. So like for example I bet someone that I know actually decided to be a teacher for some time. So they basically became a primary school teacher after being in like the world of product and kind of tech for a long time. And I don't know what is gonna come out of the other side for that, but I kind of suspect that he's not going to leave just tech forever. Like there's going to be some time when those two fields collide again.</p><p>And actually this is not someone that's, I wouldn't call her my friend, but someone that I know of when I interned at Facebook. She was like this very cool manager that like all the interns talk about her. And she's like, she's so cool. She's this product designer at Facebook that she also makes DJ. She's also a DJ on the side and she makes music. And then she basically said at work to our interns that like, okay, if I hit this many followers and whatnot, like I'm gonna leave and probably just do music full time. And then recently, actually, a lot of people, I think she got viral on Twitter for something. And I was like, I know this person. And someone would basically was tweeting like, this like an electronic artist that I absolutely adore, like finding out that she was a product designer at Facebook blew my mind that she was one of us. She was like a tech worker. And then she basically</p><p><strong>Packy (28:55)</strong></p><p>She did it.</p><p><strong>Tina He (28:56)</strong></p><p>She did it. And then she retweeted that and then she said something very thoughtful and then she said without building products, I don't think I will ever be a musician. She's always loved music, but then I think that the fact of becoming a writer, becoming an architect, becoming a musician just sounds so overwhelming that but then in product, you know, I think that we all learn that no one knows what's going on. Like we just have to iterate and ship and find out it's OK to fail because that's intrinsic of the culture.</p><p>And like without that, I think training at Facebook of like probably running a lot of experiments, probably failing a lot, probably iterating a lot, learning that mindset. She's able to apply that to music. And then she basically iterated her way into finding product market fit in her music and for the right audience. So I think that's also broadly true where if you just give up one set of metrics where she's definitely not, you know, wanting to be like the best product designer at Facebook, maybe, but then she opted for something else. And then by playing different games, you're able to see more perspectives. That leads to potentially a good intersection.</p><p><strong>Packy (29:55)</strong></p><p>It strikes me, because that really resonates with me, it strikes me that a bunch of these are available if you've already played the game and won, and maybe in the old system, played the game and won and have the resources to be like, I'm gonna go DJ now. I've made enough money at Facebook, I'm gonna DJ, I hope it works, I hope I'll iterate myself into success, and if it doesn't, I'll still eat.</p><p><strong>Tina He (30:10)</strong></p><p>Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Packy (30:16)</strong></p><p>And so one, what do you think about that? Like just kind of more broadly, like how you would play the game, but then two, maybe this is like, if we actually do get abundance and everyone can eat and have housing and whatever, like maybe this is where we're all heading and these people are a bit of a preview. What are your thoughts on all of that?</p><p><strong>Tina He (30:31)</strong></p><p>Yeah, I believe in that. I do think that the playing field, although it doesn't feel like it, think inequality and the playing field leveling people think those are two contradicting forces where technology is democratizing and no one can deny that, right? Everyone can pick up a laptop if you have internet access.</p><p>Obviously there's more work to do to even increase internet access further, but if you do have an internet and you can, using the crypto, and then you can mine Bitcoin, when's the right time, can mine other coins. You can participate in the internet economy, you can publish content, you can write code. I think the level field actually has been...really reshuffled like over the past couple decades where now especially working in crypto you see some of the best talent just emerging from all these like different weird markets and you know when we go to these world tour and visiting these emerging markets and how they're using crypto they know like everything that's happening within the company which is kind of insane where you know, and everywhere you go, like you can see like consistently find like a couple hundred fans of like what you're doing, which is just so great and fascinating and many great founders are starting to emerge in those markets.</p><p>So I would say that the playing field is becoming much more leveled and I wouldn't say that's the case even like a couple years ago where I think that people were still like, people were making fun of VCs being all white male and you know, like they don't, they don't know how to invest in female products because like, know, without Sarah Tamil, they wouldn't have invested in Pinterest. There's no man uses Pinterest. Like that was very recent, right? Like we kind of heard that story is very recent and, and that has been changing a lot too, where I definitely don't think it's perfect by any means.</p><p>But I do think that the aperture of perspectives is increasing. But at the same time, if you create any type of market mechanism that's democratic and open market, like TikTok as an example, think it's an open market. Twitter is an open market. Obviously Twitter now may be less so because there's a very strong centralized control on the top, but assuming that it is, or just maybe the internet in general.</p><p>You wrote this great piece like a while back called The Great Internet Game, I think it's what it's called.</p><p><strong>Packy (32:36)</strong></p><p><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f038214f-ba7e-42b2-8c20-4e2008d4526f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Great Online Game</a></em><span>, yeah.</span></p><p><strong>Tina He (32:37)</strong></p><p>The great online game. Yes, exactly. So in the great online game, right, everyone can participate and potentially win. But at the same time with any of these dynamics, because of the like Malthusian dynamics that we talk about, it is PVP, like at least in the short term, not in the long term, because if you build new things, if you allow more idea generation, that's why I'm obsessed with tools companies, always long tools companies, because tools companies are essentially the ability for like, like enablement that creates literal leverage, like what will create more leverage and more literally get tools. And I think that's like a kind of consistent trend in humanity where if you like to invest, if you build a tools layer, then you can always see more interesting things happening. There's definitely wealth generation there, but then with that wealth generation, whoever invents the tools, which is probably in the minority usually ended up becoming wealthy, then, yeah. So basically there's always this inequality dynamics that the Gini coefficient of these marketplaces is very, very high because generally the more open something is, we can also see inequality sometimes also increases. So those two dynamics coexist at the same time.</p><p><strong>Packy (33:45)</strong></p><p>I think I want to kind of start closing out on one observation that you made that I loved and then one observation that I made about just kind of the way that you, the way this piece came together and both of them I think feel like a little bit of a guide to how to play the future.</p><p>One was your quote that said, “What if the most game optimal play in the new system is actually to become relentlessly unapologetically you,” and I think that comes across in this essay and would love your thoughts on that.</p><p>The other is just in terms of how this essay came about, it's so interesting to me that it seems like so much of the fodder for it, like we've talked about kind of online, but also just comes from conversations with friends in person. And it does feel like there's like a real importance and almost culturally like coming back to this a little bit that people just like maybe post COVID, maybe just like there's spending too much time on the internet and have internet brain, but there's just so much richness in talking to people and hanging out with people in person. So maybe being you in person with your friends is the answer. What do you think is the answer here?</p><p><strong>Tina He (34:43)</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think it really being you, it's very hard in this world where we are so programmed to optimize for some axis of either the market, the algorithm, the internet, whatever that is. Like I think that it sounds so cliche. It's like, okay, you have to find out who you are.</p><p>But if actually you ask this question to many people, it's a very overwhelming question, right? I think some people are very assured with who they are, but then they maybe are not aware who they think they are might not be who they actually are, right? Like it's just very hard to believe that if someone say who I am is that I want to build like 20 businesses until I die. And I've actually met someone like that before and it's very believable, but I've been there before where I also was really wanting to kind of prove myself to the system and wanting to do something.</p><p>To do so, like I still have the hunger in me, but at the same time, like you can hold different perspectives at the same time. And the game optimal way of you have to be apologetic yourself. It's actually like a logical proof. I think that a lot of my essays is my way of understanding like exactly if you lay out all the logical steps of a re a line of reasoning and those line of reasoning usually come from like a spark of inspiration from like a conversation or like from from some dynamics that I like notice this like larger system level dynamic, then you have to deduce like, okay, what's the second order effect? What's the third order effect? And like logically conclusion like, like what do I need to do to kind of like, you know, be a part of this system that I've just observed, which I think is both kind of self, maybe like self reliant in some ways and also self preserving, where I need to make sense of this.</p><p>And then I think if I'm trying to make sense of this, it might help other people. And like, basically the deduction that, you know, we've gone through with the reasoning is that, yeah, the only way you can because the the system changes in terms of one is if a centralizing system, the centralized rule maker can just change the game anytime. If it's a completely open system, then you're just always falling to this open market dynamics that we just talked about in depth. So there's actually no, either you build a system, which is great, right? Or there's really no way to opt out. So I would encourage you have to build a system if you don't want to participate in either of those paths.</p><p>That could like it might not mean like I want to build an alternative Twitter although that can be the case But it does mean that the only way you can have a competitive advantage Which actually if you think back on zero to one and what Peter Thiel wrote about about building Monopoly It's very resonant with that idea where you have to build your own personal Monopoly and that has not been a net new idea at all But I think that this idea is just way more resonant and relevant in our time and there's like case in point to prove It's like a step-by-step proof.</p><p>I'm like why that's the case and obviously there's like an aspirational aspect to it too, where it's like, just be yourself. Like that's probably the best way to go. And that's been like when people come to me for career advice, I was like, I cannot give advice. I don't know you. And if I know you very well, I may be able to give some advice and ask questions, but I don't give advice to strangers. I don't know you. And I just ask them like, just be your, like, what do you want to do? Tell me what you want. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Packy (37:39)</strong></p><p>Hahaha</p><p>Midwit Curve strikes again. Like it's be yourself. No, no, no, like I need to do all these things. Be yourself. And I think it actually is really true. It's like, I've been thinking about a lot of the same questions you have and I end up getting to that kind of same point at the end, which is like not for any other reason, but like.</p><p>assume we abstract away the economy and like everything is taken care of and that like all the jobs go like What are you here to experience and like what would you get out of? Unlimited resources and like you have to answer that question for yourself. It's just a very hard question to answer and I think that you writing things like this really helps and I'm excited to share it with more people. I guess two closing questions the first is:</p><p>Who's somebody that you've read recently that you don't think a lot of people know about, but that you've really enjoyed reading?</p><p><strong>Tina He (38:34)</strong></p><p>Totally.</p><p><span>I think she's getting much more well known so I'm not sure if she's like under discovered, but I really enjoy this woman called Cate Hall. You may have come across her writing before she wrote this piece called </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c9944acd-9f12-41b3-9082-618c74a4c748?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">How to Be More Agentic</a></em><span>. I mean, she's a very pragmatic writer. She's very sharp and And I think that a lot of my essays tend to be a lot more philosophical and like much more asking questions and trying to get to a conclusion with that deductive process that I just mentioned, but I think her essays feel very practical where this is how you can be more agentic like I wrote another piece called </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ccf53c08-0b98-419c-a518-53950e48527f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Last Human Choice</a></em><span> that essentially is about you know agency is probably one of like preserving agencies, one of the most important things to work on post-AGI is my personal opinion of like what's important.</span></p><p>But in that essay also, again, it's like an observation of the system. And then I think that that's why I think this is important, but it doesn't get to like, okay, if this is important, what do do with it? There are some hints at that, but I think she kind of complimented that essay very, very well where she actually, wrote about.</p><p>Like exactly how to be more agentic, right? Like take more risks, like enjoying low status and that's your moat, increase your luck surface area. And then she gave very personal and also tangible examples. So I think that her essay was very empowering to read.</p><p><strong>Packy (39:47)</strong></p><p>Love that. And then last one is if there's like a one, you know, one sound bite that someone can take away from the Jevons Paradox essay, what would that one sound bite be?</p><p><strong>Tina He (39:57)</strong></p><p>In the world where you can just do things, why don't you just be yourself?</p><p><strong>Packy (40:02)</strong></p><p>Amen. man,</p><p>Tina, thank you for very much being yourself. I think both writing it and then kind of by example. I've always been, as you know, a huge fan. And so thank you for guinea pigging this with me and thank you for writing.</p><p><strong>Tina He (40:14)</strong></p><p>Of course. That's so much fun.</p></div>",

Carved into a cliff some two hundred feet above the road that led from the Iranian plateau to Iraq, its survival had been ensured by its sheer accessibility. The chance to risk life and limb in the cause of deciphering ancient scripts, however, was one that the odd adventurer might positively relish. One such was Henry Rawlinson, a British officer on secondment from India to the Persian court. He first scouted out Bisitun in 1835, scaling the cliff as best as he was able, and recording as much of the inscription as he could make out. Then, eight years later, he returned to the site properly equipped with planks and ropes. Balanced precariously on a ladder, he was able to complete his transcription. ‘The interest of the occupation,’ he later recalled, ‘entirely did away with any sense of danger.’ By 1845 Rawlinson had completed a full translation of the section written in Persian, and sent it for publication in London. The Great King Spoke once more.</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s a long block quote, probably too long for an essay this length.

We are getting better at reading the world, just as a book that is entirely illegible to a two-year-old becomes entirely legible to a ten-year-old through improved skill.</p><p><strong>The second reason for Hyperlegibility is the more fascinating one: we are tripping over ourselves to make ourselves easier to read.</strong></p><p>Think Personal User Manuals. Think Tyler Cowen writing for the AIs. Think me, writing this.</p><p>We are game theoretically driven to share more and more of our best ideas, the ones that we might have once exploited in silence.</p><p>Here’s an example I like that hits close to home.</p><p>Imagine you’re a small emerging early stage venture capital fund. You’ve noticed something about the market that no one else has. Say you believe that quantum computing is closer than anyone else believes. You’ve identified a handful of promising companies that you want to back.</p><p>What do you do? Do you keep it secret or tell the world?</p><p>Well, what do you need to do in order to successfully invest against your thesis?</p><p>First, you’ll need to raise money from LPs. To do that, you’ll need to spell out as clearly as possible why you believe quantum computing is more investable than everyone else does and which types of companies you think are most investable. Maybe you have a network already, and you can do all of this behind the scenes. Maybe you don’t, and you need to yell your thesis from the rooftops: blog posts, podcast appearances, conference panels, whatever. One thing a differentiated view can get you is attention. So you trade a secret for the chance at money.</p><p>Assuming you raise, you’ll need to stand out to the companies you want to invest in. This is not the public markets; you can’t just invest in whatever you choose. They need to choose you, too. Maybe in the early days, you can know everyone – go to the conferences, meet them one-on-one, impress them with your insights and with the fact that you believe harder than anyone else does. Does that scale? Do your early investments pay off quickly enough to build a reputation in the community before other investors come in? How do you stand out?</p><p><span>Say you convince companies to let you invest early, you need to help them continue to raise money from downstream capital. </span><em><strong>Which means part of your job is to make quantum legible to the very firms who might one day compete with you.</strong></em><span> Sure, while your category is small, unproven, weird, and risky, they might let you win at the early stage. But eventually, they won’t. Either way, the proximate issue is getting your companies funded so your investments don’t go to zero before your ideas have had time to play out.</span></p><p>In all three pieces of your job, you are incentivized in the short-term to make yourself and your ideas Hyperlegible so LPs, founders, and downstream capital can find you. And without the short-term, there is no long-term.</p><p><span>Now imagine this dynamic playing out </span><strong>everywhere</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>My friend </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/32f33155-e830-4a65-b059-0f206cf7b5a2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Tina He</a><span> wrote an excellent essay last week, </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bb8ee6a4-f18d-4280-8086-24ac06d99889?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Jevons Paradox: a personal perspective</a></em><span>.

The ideas in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/dc6fb999-5cbc-48e6-bc53-a1bfe4952068?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Most Human Wins</a></em><span> are enhanced by thinking about Hyperlegibility. And I am quite certain that the more Hyperlegible most things become, the more people will crave mysteries and </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e023c0c0-7864-42a2-af73-0c65b9810c52?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Return of Magic</a></em><span>.</span></p><p>But for now, I’ll leave you with this: Hyperlegibility is our reality. There’s no going back.</p><p>There is a generation of people living among us who don’t feel the same nostalgia for newspapers and “not knowing the answer to something immediately” that I do, because they never had those experiences in the first place. And they’re a preview of what happens when you take all of human knowledge as a commoditized input.</p><p>I’ve been talking to more college students recently, and despite rumors of their demise, the kids are very alright. Maybe every generation thinks this, but I’ve walked away from a few recent conversations thinking, “If I were competing with these people I would be COOKED.” They’ve somehow read as much as I have but have the faster brains of youth. It’s a scary combination.</p><p><span>The other day, I asked one of them, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3623a520-cf3a-43ce-93af-2432ebeacb40?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Malhar Manek</a><span>, why so many of his peers seemed so scarily advanced. His answer was that they grew up on the internet, with access to all of the information imaginable. Not just the fire hose, but the blogs and newsletters and podcasts and YouTube videos that helped make sense of the stream. So it was easy for a relatively curious kid to figure out </span><em>what </em><span>to read to set a baseline, and then, baseline established while the brain is still fresh and curious, to jump off of that base of knowledge to ask their own </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d972e41c-bc79-41a0-ba2a-140c2744ade1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">questions</a><span>. To help answer them, they have all of the internet’s information, AI, and even one-DM-away access to experts.</span></p><p>I’d never thought of it that way, because I didn’t live it. But by making the world Hyperlegible, we helped create a generation of Hyperlegibility-Native Hyperlexics who take as an input the information we worked to turn into an output. And thus civilization evolves and compounds.</p><p><span>A priori, I would have guessed that giving everyone access to the same information would lead to a convergence of goals. That doesn’t seem to be happening. One of the people I spoke with wants to start a vertically integrated healthcare company, another wants to write a Great Book, and what I’ve heard very consistently from smart college kids is that </span><em>their</em><span> smartest friends are all working on biotech, specifically neuro, specifically </span><strong>brain-computer interfaces</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Which is to say, if you think the world is Hyperlegible now, just wait.</p><p><span>That’s all for today! If you have a minute, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a925daa3-e733-4060-8c05-a8b49a61d74d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">go get SOC-2 or ISO 27001 compliant</a><span>. </span></p><p>While you do that, we’ll be working hard on a Weekly Dose, and might even drop a new podcast on you in the interim. We’ll be back in your inbox… soon.</p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>Packy</p></div>",

tournaments, the maddest weekend of all is the first one, when fields of 64<sup><a href=\"#ipfootnote0\" class=\"ipfootnote_ref\">1</a></sup> are trimmed down to the Sweet 16; this means there are 16 games a day the first two days, and 8 games a day for the next two. Inevitably this means that multiple games are on at the same time, and Max has a solution for you; from <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/max-multiview-march-madness-2025\">The Streamable</a>:</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-youtube-wiz-3.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1\"></figure>\n<p>The 2025 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament starts today, and just in time, Warner Bros. Discovery has announced the addition of some very modern features for games that stream on its on-demand service Max. Fans can use Max to stream all March Madness games on TNT, TBS, and truTV, and that viewing experience is about to improve in a big way.</p>\n<p>The new Max feature that fans will likely appreciate most while watching NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament games is a multiview. This will allow fans to watch up to three games at once, ensuring they never miss a single bucket, block, or steal from the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>Except that’s not correct; Warner Bros. Discovery shares the rights to the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament with CBS, and there were times over the weekend when there were games on CBS and a Warner Bros. Discovery property — sometimes four at once. That means that Max multiview watchers were in fact missing buckets, blocks, and steals, and likely from the highest profile games, which were more likely to be on the broadcast network.</p>\n<p>Notice, however, that I specified <em>Max</em> multiview watchers; YouTube TV has offered multiview for the NCAA Tournament since last year. Critically, YouTube TV’s offering includes CBS, and, starting this upcoming weekend, will also let you watch the women’s tournament as well; from <a href=\"https://www.sportico.com/business/tech/2025/youtube-tv-march-madness-streaming-multiview-mens-womens-1234844217/\">Sportico</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Generally, events from the same leagues are kept together. On Friday, for instance, men’s and women’s multiviews will be offered separately. If you truly want to watch all of March Madness live, it’ll be time to break out that second screen again. However, in part due to user demand, YouTube TV says mixed gender multiviews will be available starting with the Sweet 16.</p>\n<p>The job of prioritizing selections has only gotten more complicated as interest in women’s hoops has boomed. Through the first two rounds in 2024, viewership of the women’s tourney was up 108% over the year prior. Though the “March Madness” brand is now used for both men’s and women’s competitions, separate media deals dictate their distribution. CBS and TNT Sports networks split the men’s games, including streaming on March Madness Live apps, while ESPN’s channels host women’s action. Disney+ will also carry the Final Four. Cable providers, then, are required for fans hoping to seamlessly hop back and forth between the two brackets, even as fans shift to a streaming-first future.</p>\n\n<p>That last sentence is the key: Warner Bros. Discovery only has access to the games it owns rights to; YouTube TV, by virtue of being a virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (vMVPD), has access to every game that is on cable, which is all of them. That lets the service offer an objectively better multiview experience.</p>\n<h3>YouTube TV’s Virtual Advantage</h3>\n<p>Multiview isn’t a new idea; in 1983 George Schnurle III invented the MultiVision:</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Multivision11-1680x1050.jpg\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-youtube-wiz-2.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1\"></a><figcaption>Mrmazda, CC-SA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This image is of the MultiVision 1.1, which took in four composite inputs; the 3.1 model included two built-in tuners — you provided the antenna. The Multivision didn’t provide multiview a la YouTube TV, but rather picture-in-picture, support for which was eventually built into TVs directly.</p>\n<p>Picture-in-picture, however, assumed that consumers had easy access to TV signals; this was a reasonable assumption when signals came in over-the-air or via basic cable. That changed in the late 1990s with the shift to digital cable, which required a set-top box to decrypt; most TVs only had one, and the picture-in-picture feature faded away. This loss was made up in part by the addition of DVR functionality to most of those set-top boxes; with time-shifting you couldn’t watch two things at once, but you could watch two things that aired at the same time.</p>\n<p>Cable companies offered DVR functionality in response to the popularity of TiVo; when the first model launched in 1999 it too relied on the relative openness of TV signals. Later models needed cable cards, which were mandated by the FCC in 2007; that mandate was repealed in 2020, as the good-enough nature of cable set-top boxes effectively killed the market for TiVo and other 3rd-party tuners.</p>\n<p>The first vMVPD, meanwhile, was Sling TV, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/daily-update-sling-tv-interview-makes-15-million-rokus-smart-tv-play/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.fSFYpvGPQXGCx3Xenn9OXXW2tuy5A-sVZTOO8j4_9lvWY2YixDNTz8XsxodP9fijFEoMHruYa9SIMckkgB8lT1evSrnNxq9di__VKldbs6Y3WoI4rRbJmt8Rje_mRsJzKzxa__55T1e8-H7kAiRARPLXAmC-42Tyxbr5A03fuW5zmaUN6-w52DLeVUSxkO_GuOqCa_t5Xu-gb1zIv0WAHjyrKoKveya-6_hc4-wHGuzDj2P9kxZ0AWn1o2KTguyUJhAYKoS7SK1QArwT2wb2BnjHpnismaqTRyPJtv7NA_5FEkn0BTKu0OHfKhClWfoLUomQ6YJZcH5TnflQiMy0cg\">which launched in 2015</a>.<sup><a href=\"#ipfootnote1\" class=\"ipfootnote_ref\">2</a></sup> YouTube TV launched two years later, with an old Google trick: unlimited storage for your cloud DVR, which you could watch anywhere in the U.S. on any device. That was possible because the point of integration for YouTube TV, unlike traditional cable, was on Google’s servers, not a set-top box (which itself was a manifestation of traditional MVPD’s point of integration being the cable into your house).</p>\n<p>This point of integration also explains why it was YouTube TV that came up with the modern implementation of multiview: Google could create this new feature centrally and make it available to everyone without needing to install high-powered set-top boxes in people’s homes. Indeed, this explains one of the shortcomings of multiview: because Google can not rely on viewers having high powered devices capable of showing four independent video streams, Google actually pre-mixes the streams into a single video feed on their servers.</p>\n<h3>YouTube TV + NFL Sunday Ticket</h3>\n<p>I mentioned above that YouTube TV offered multiview for March Madness starting last year, but that’s not quite right: a subset of the consumer base actually got access for March Madness in 2023; that was a beta test for the real launch, which was the 2023 NFL season. That was the first year that Google had the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which lets subscribers view out-of-market games. NFL Sunday Ticket was a prerequisite for multiview, because without it you would have access to at most two football games at a time; once you could watch all of the games, the utility was obvious.</p>\n<p>The point of this Article is not multiview; it’s a niche use case for events like March Madness or football fanatics on Sunday afternoons. What is notable about the latter example, however, is that Google needed to first secure the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket. This, unlike March Madness, wasn’t a situation where every game was already on cable, and thus accessible to YouTube TV; Google needed to pay $2 billion/year to secure the necessary rights to make multiview work.</p>\n<p>That’s a high price, even if multiview is cool; it seems unlikely that Google will ever make its money back directly. That, though, is often the case with the NFL. Back in 1993 Rupert Murdoch shocked the world by buying NFL broadcasting rights for a then-unprecedented $395 million/year, $100 million/year more than CBS was offering for the same package. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160403093658/https://www.si.com/vault/1993/12/27/130193/out-foxed-rupert-murdochs-upstart-network-snatched-the-nfl-from-cbs-in-a-coup-that-will-change-the-face-of-televised-sports\">Sports Illustrated explained his reasoning</a>:</p>\n\n<p>There are skeptics who think that Murdoch will lose his custom-made shirt over the NFL deal; one estimate has him losing $500 million over the next four years. Says Murdoch, “I’ve seen those outrageous numbers. We’ll lose a few million in the first year, but even if it was 40 or 50 million, it would be tax deductible. It was a cheap way of buying a network.”</p>\n\n<p>What Murdoch meant was that demand for the NFL — <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2023/the-rise-and-fall-of-espns-leverage/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIzL3RoZS1yaXNlLWFuZC1mYWxsLW9mLWVzcG5zLWxldmVyYWdlLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1NDIwODQ0LCJpYXQiOjE3NDI4Mjg4NDQsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.j8QKioMKZzeyqHYqde18Znk-LxYpChzRJPB7xyL5ARx8roYWcP5BGoasICqz7mUXP8h9SuAKdySjGvG8IQKQXF9N7gI9aaiYz19cTx1SINhtBcCnK_kEWgDn2ldT82waOr9zNNCz9UlNtwtCqKxBiqNZZ03AkdclEN0JijhAPBwgJkYvp-2jCNfLGXvQQ9EGi6HygcDZYXbJxo9TZfnuT9I4Fb1FvzApG5ftyNqDwHsdsnKk99_dmfUzb2uOVVLj6gTV1FcVQvP6HMqmVeSf5BfboygLvMwwbyTe1dY7HnKzPnSUP98dpsTx3ntsCsEEydN4I3qYgXgLZBG8gtj0Kg\">which had already built ESPN</a> — would get Fox into the cities where it didn’t yet exist, and improve its affiliate station’s standing (many of which Murdoch owned) in cities where they were weak and buried on the inferior UHF band. And, of course, that is exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>NFL Sunday Ticket is not, to be sure, the same as regular NFL rights; it is much more of a niche product with a subscription business model. That, though, is actually a good thing from Google’s perspective: the company’s opportunity is not to build a TV station, but rather a TV Aggregator.</p>\n<h3>YouTube TV’s Aggregation Potential</h3>\n<p>Google announced the NFL deal a month after <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/186700907/%F0%9F%93%BA-youtube-primetime-channels-are-here?hl=en\">it launched Primetime Channels</a>, a marketplace for streaming services along the lines of Amazon’s Prime Video Channels or Apple TV Channels; I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2023/google-earnings-youtubes-aggregation-bid-youtube-shorts-monetization/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.AvuOQitAa3snMQxztZ7wjIs-6eCPXGDpBPi7txiUOWracIGIqoRFVNOSfJWOdJ4y3W_PlSIe0n91HL7tzD3DdPbnhzBZWDgB2SezAfBjVExXrV1MfaV4RsDioJ_DDRhz69UPSDuhONOZf720eJTOqMK_GjTpyHv79WdDVqw7SdcWNSQUe_IdRB3GvYCWIgAOMUjsQRPsL6k2_C43eLbMD-hmxLfI2jWvS8xXmP0nYq_lLHRIV1sbCmIaeuU4-kNp73BCr7FOZ6IDGgpIqk7w883h9cXRxruWqxMd1WoOpJkzPXk0I4ZYBEqMoXc3RyJ63nKNJyxWBkhVVurKqOGgHw\">early 2023</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The missing piece has been — in contrast to Apple and Amazon in particular — other streaming services.

The idealized future is one where YouTube is the front-door of all video period, whether that be streaming, linear, or user-generated.</p>\n\n<p>YouTube’s big advantage, as I noted in that Update, is that it has exclusive access to YouTube content; it is the only service that can offer basically anything you might want to watch on TV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube TV has linear television, which remains important for sports</li>\n<li>YouTube proper dominates user-generated content</li>\n<li>Primetime Channels is a way to bring other streaming services on board</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The real potential with streaming channels, however, is to go beyond selling subscriptions on an ad-hoc basis and actually integrating them into a single interface to drive discoverability and on-demand conversions. How useful would it be to see everything that is on in one place, and be able to either watch with one click, or subscribe with two?</p>\n<p>This is going to be an increasingly pressing need as sports in particular move to streaming. It used to be that all of the sports you might watch were in a centralized place: the channel guide on your set-top box. Today, however, many sports are buried in apps. Prominent examples include Amazon Thursday Night Football and Peacock’s exclusive NFL playoff games, but as a Wisconsin fan I’ve already experienced the challenge of an increasing number of college basketball games being exclusively streamed on Peacock; the problem is only going to get worse next season when an increasing number of NBA games are on Amazon and Peacock, and when ESPN releases a standalone streaming app with all of its games.</p>\n<p>The challenge for any one of these services is the same one seen with Max’s multiview offering: any particular streaming service is limited to its own content. Sure, any one of these services could try and build this offering anyways — <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2023/an-espn-aggregator-google-magic-eraser-bing-chat-monetization/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2FuLWVzcG4tYWdncmVnYXRvci1nb29nbGUtbWFnaWMtZXJhc2VyLWJpbmctY2hhdC1tb25ldGl6YXRpb24vIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NDU0MjA4NDQsImlhdCI6MTc0MjgyODg0NCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.GKZ7IHEfvl8kQ1ItQQ6iyWz2XFyNUtAR_CmcJ8Gg3MpWSJJm1V6aZXfW7AxF94585B_hTRikaPmlZlmGwOjYCoOLhfQ3TBDEK-GvtKmdabjIT8xFUlbKIFR6Gx9ibSDd_3O-unh5l5Wb-R6rL-3Umf7NO7AGxZBzBlzU1HScsIxHY5USiNGAkP2gTznMt_8Ci2sWkSCyqLNHqpSNozG-IEuzxdNZxF2Xr9kBDwm1964ReV8nqcGwf2AGmEW22zRcIxj9F6FYP_6vV-f0ZtGu8qC2NBKADyfiFN_NLcPSx-vQ44C2-hy8nADV2l6S6U19lFLXeZr1F_nCFLZl7vwHww\">ESPN is reportedly considering it</a> — but then they run into the problem of not being a platform or marketplace with a massive audience already in place.</p>\n<p>The reason why that is an essential prerequisite is that executing on this vision will require forming partnerships with all of the various streamers — or at least those with live events like sports. On one hand, of course each individual streamer wants to own the customer relationship; on the other hand, sports rights both cost a lot of money and also lose their value the moment an event happens. That means they are motivated to trade away customer control and a commission for more subscribers, which works to the benefit of whoever can marshal the most demand, and YouTube, thanks primarily to its user-generated content, has the largest audience of all, and thanks to YouTube TV, is the only service that can actually offer everything.</p>\n<h3>Google’s Product Problem</h3>\n<p>Two quick questions for the audience:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Did you know that Primetime Channels existed?</li>\n<li>How do you subscribe to Primetime Channels?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer to number 2 is convoluted, to say the least; on a PC, you click the hamburger button in the upper left, then click “Your movies &amp; TV”, then click the “Browse” tab, and there you will finally find Primetime channels; on mobile the “Your movies &amp; TV” is found by clicking your profile photo on the bottom right.</p>\n<p>And, once you finally figure this out, you see a pretty pathetic list:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-youtube-wiz-1.png?resize=768%2C159&amp;ssl=1\"></figure>\n<p>As the arrow indicates, there are more options, but the only one of prominence is Paramount+; there is no Disney+, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, or Netflix.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Netflix’s resistance to being aggregated is long-running; they were the stick in the mud when Apple tried to aggregate streaming <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-should-buy-netflix/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE2L2FwcGxlLXNob3VsZC1idXktbmV0ZmxpeC8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0NTQyMDg0NCwiaWF0IjoxNzQyODI4ODQ0LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.LKOdwxfrqMKpeWz68aAXm1OTEXNV2c7_7Fvwf7ZGnNKN-eU_9r9s6CkgDex6QpNijSNFKRDxlUBwbjiS09PvvuceUcJY-laNtSy0PAmlL_K6kD9Ydn8c1Vbby-kyP7OYdWkNF3gYad4UgN4V4BULUcplSQhT4OME0oz3Z5QUX2voTsTa9MvzCWr3EtmngiGbBjMEIjYhHGEGCAIULwaGotmSULdUlLIJyghd4r__kU0xJRFBZmm1F47ehXEt-_ruuHXeA2T9Ap5BZs8YcHm9PZ4IpMtCTN8Sq_I7XXRiO9QsfHwBHD8xRaPaOzRYN9mY7OOTMUD3i6dpluj91nPIOQ\">a decade ago</a>. The company gets away with it — and are right to resist — because they have the largest user base amongst subscription platforms. The biggest bull case for Netflix is that many of the other streamers throw in the towel and realize they are better off just selling content to Netflix.</li>\n<li>Disney+ actually could pull off a fair bit of what YouTube is primed to do: no, Disney doesn’t have YouTube’s user-generated content, but the company does have Hulu Live, which gives a potential Aggregation offering access to content still on linear TV.</li>\n<li>Amazon and Apple are Google’s most obvious competitors when it comes to building an Aggregator for streaming services, and they have the advantage of owning hardware to facilitate transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That leaves Peacock, and this is where I hold Google responsible. Peacock has large bills and a relatively small userbase; there is also a Peacock app for both Amazon devices (although you have to subscribe to Peacock directly) and Apple devices (where Apple enforces an in-app subscription offering). If Google is serious about Primetime Channels specifically, and being a streaming and sports Aggregator generally, then it should have Peacock available as an offering.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing, though: it’s not clear that Google has made any sort of progress in achieving the vision I perceived two years ago in the wake of the launch of Primetime Channels and the NFL Sunday Ticket deal. Yes, YouTube continues to grow, particularly on TVs, and yes, multivision is slowly getting better, but both of those are products of inertia; is Google so arthritic that it can’t make a play to dominate an entertainment industry that is getting religion about the need to acquire and keep customers profitably? That’s exactly why Aggregators gain power over suppliers: they solve their demand problem. And yet Primetime Channels might as well not even exist, given how buried it is, and it might as well be, given that Google hasn’t signed a meaningful new deal since launch.</p>\n<h3>Google’s Wiz Acquisition</h3>\n<p>This is all convoluted way to explain why I approve of Google’s decision to pay $32 billion in cash for Wiz, a cybersecurity firm that has absolutely nothing to do with the future of TV. From <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/google-agrees-to-buy-cloud-security-firm-wiz-for-32-billion\">Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Google parent Alphabet Inc. agreed to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz Inc. for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent. Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.</p>\n<p>The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision. The companies have agreed to a breakup fee of about 10% of the deal value, or $3.2 billion, if the deal doesn’t close, according to a person familiar with the matter. Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Wiz provides cybersecurity solutions for multi-cloud environments, and is growing fast. This makes it a natural fit for Google Cloud, which is a distant third place to AWS and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud’s biggest opportunity for growth is to be a service that is used in addition to a large corporation’s existing cloud infrastructure, and Wiz provides both a beachhead into those organizations and also a solution to managing a multi-cloud setup.</p>\n<p>Google Cloud’s selling point — the reason it might expand beyond a Wiz beachhead — are Google’s AI offerings. Google continues to have excellent AI research and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/gemini-1-5-and-googles-nature/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L2dlbWluaS0xLTUtYW5kLWdvb2dsZXMtbmF0dXJlLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1NDIwODQ0LCJpYXQiOjE3NDI4Mjg4NDQsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.MEPoxgeG8fdpzNW-UjwXTJKEeop8Y2gbD5zj0MvKTZc7JZraJFuoH7kurws9c7hFT4FEvlUGXbsQh1nvuWFJ_yJjj5-oRfBDww9q2qRMcgfkh5G7KFr7kndZ3R-OYuYOi1Yath8-h364nyvcXd5kH_avY6o0zbldPLmZRb2WhWwodrxndQxSk-pCkkMH5yPV-flPjwX2rcqwKRi8Y1JVWi9PJWmdppWipIIeAz_sL0N5BCUM2AJxFxT71G9eaXCYHwar9qvrCeXWsZsmzjDvwWuz-uR87dxOoaTKnAWEW2NlkZZA16Uhnyag2T4DDkGbzTd0u5wjMYTp19dylylQ1Q\">the best AI infrastructure</a>; <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/more-chip-curbs-google-llm-status-check/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L21vcmUtY2hpcC1jdXJicy1nb29nbGUtbGxtLXN0YXR1cy1jaGVjay8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0NTQyMDg0NCwiaWF0IjoxNzQyODI4ODQ0LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.m-llYs-oeDM7DsTxjhJsa31wFTr1FZcUdY80UhhITevQcTk4efukLdj21yyshNUFKotOssZFnAAVxNRyyIPoKUIF8pBObjtenm-mmL0ZH74AuQ-XSncuckBIAAuzLR0EW7qJVErL3rtIoc9_rc5h0Ujmdrx9cXZxnot8qQ6UMbXbVpSCjjugb8XPUKDbe5sfwemfQbRAhTnNb056-S0qdyA6Oj48KVuxmynfkxZFLE3RCyvYw2yrM0WjQTgJwCOtKuNodI811V8joQZlsPJJAgzPJw7YX_jgW4W8-y3Litbf4VZDrHsFHXwxaX7MekUHR2TRZk5ylwuaoH4U5bxjPg\">where the company is struggling is product</a>, particularly in the consumer space, thanks to some combination of fear of disruption and, well, the fact that product capability seems to be the first casualty of a monopoly (Apple’s declining product chops, particularly in software and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-ais-platform-pivot-potential/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L2FwcGxlLWFpcy1wbGF0Zm9ybS1waXZvdC1wb3RlbnRpYWwvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NDU0MjA4NDQsImlhdCI6MTc0MjgyODg0NCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.jKveplJ8n1ObwPt36rGyUKZhlcz0dGlo57DfdpCb89bjQT4-iko1LF4ga82S5QxeTiw1x09FKQwPFkuuOhQmwvZkyxKARq47bgizYbJV-viYZtZyBV_QQo2O_a8oX-7mWR7Fund6Hr_wH8H9HmlWFKQnqn7Wxm0HbsDpDGuLrxVlSABVTsJgLX98HEdhz46rPgytIMWqUHMlDquV3DbzT0IbQfA3y-3P--ACHx_Exw8qFZfVnwb44nGE-6xPis6d5w9YYwASTXMl2sJV-998jR4NpXIWazFoJUYA2ACeW7J9pjzcwtW97fdWWgRnHTWm-AoP-OTNNqxkM6T5Mz3OpA\">obviously AI</a>, is another example).</p>\n<p>The company’s tortoise-like approach to TV lends credence to the latter explanation: Google is in an amazing position in TV, thanks to the long-ago acquisition of YouTube and the launch of YouTube TV, but it has accomplished little since then beyond agreeing to pay the NFL a lot of money. Arguably the ideal solution to this sort of malaise, at least from a shareholder perspective, would be to simply collect monopoly rents and return the money to shareholders at a much higher rate than Google has to date; absent that, buying product innovation seems like the best way to actually accomplish anything.</p>\n<p>In other words, while I understand the theory of people who think that Google ought to just build Wiz’s functionality instead of paying a huge revenue multiple for a still-unprofitable startup, I think the reality of a company like Google is that said theory would run into the morass that is product development in a monopoly. It simply would not ship, and would suck if it did. Might as well pay up for momentum in a market that has some hope of leveraging the still considerable strengths that exist beneath the flab.</p>\n\n

In </span><em>Abundance</em><span>, Thompson and Klein, two of the more influential progressive pundits of the last decade, call for a proactive government to unlock supply and make goods and services more abundant and affordable.</span></p><p>The Abundance Agenda is the ideological first cousin of, what I’ll call, our Optimism Agenda. Both believe that the future can be better — that we can progress — and that individuals and organizations have agency in bringing about that future. And at the core of each agenda is action — in order for society to progress, we need to take more action and we need to build more.</p><p>Abundance is also, as far as I can tell, the leading and most compelling vision for America’s new Democratic Party. The Democratic Party, at least in theory, stands for a social safety net, economic equality, civil rights, and progressive policies on healthcare, climate change, and education. These outcomes are the same desired outcomes of the Abundance Agenda. But the Abundance Agenda offers a new roadmap for how we can achieve them. Whether or not the Democratic Party or a compelling Democratic politician fully embraces that roadmap is still very much TBD. I, for one, hope they do.</p><p><span>Perhaps no ideological theory has been written about more — directly or indirectly — in the </span><em>Weekly Dose of Optimism </em><span>than the Abundance Agenda. Now, thankfully, that entire theory is presented to us in a full book.

The two set out for an 8-day mission aboard Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft but ended up spending 313 days on the International Space Station due to Starliner propulsion issues. Over the last couple of months, the “extended stay” was politicized by both parties — including Elon Musk — but thankfully the astronauts adapted to their situation —conducting research, spacewalks, and coping with physical tolls of prolonged weightlessness.</p><p>Ultimately SpaceX did save the day. NASA relied on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which was already docked at the ISS as part of regular crew rotation capsule, to bring the two back to earth. We’re just glad that they’re back and that the private space industry is in such a place that these types of blunders can be relatively easily righted.</p><p><em>Ritwik Pavan on Hardware Nation</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Imagine never having to do a household chore again.</em></p></blockquote><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/838c9aa1-f90f-426b-936e-3d548eafff05?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/AoUnXZg0Wb0\"></a><p><span>Packy here.

If you’ve never been or haven’t heard of it, it’s an absolutely massive (and overwhelming) display of the latest CPG innovations and trends. Think protein-everything, functional sodas, newfound supplements…think creatine gummies. The Expo has gotten bigger and bigger each year, in line with both consumer demand for better-for-you options and the growing consumer realization that our food system in the U.S. is pretty fucked. And despite all of the showcasing brands and all of the hype, the truth is that a few companies in the country still drive the vast majority of purchasing volume. The top five firms—Nestlé, PepsiCo, The Kraft Heinz Company, General Mills, and Unilever — control a substantial portion of the market. And I think it’s wrong to view these companies as evil. It’s that they’re operating in a system with poorly aligned incentive structures and serving consumers that have been poorly educated.  </p><p>There’s really two ways to change this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Government Intervention: </strong><span>The government can come in and mandate certain protocols and requirements and restrictions. The U.S. government has, for better or worse, been pretty laissez faire on this front historically. One of the hopes of the new Administration is that RFK’s MAHA agenda will take a more front footed approach to policing Big Food. I am all for banning Red 40 in my chips. But I don’t necessarily want RFK telling me exactly what I can and cannot indulge in.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Trends + Product Innovation: </strong><span>The other way to change the system is to change consumer demand and then offering consumers new products that better align with that new demand. All easier said than done. How do you change consumer demand? A mix of education, scare tactics, marketing, expanded distribution, and product innovation.</span></p></li></ol><p>The company highlighted in the Bloomberg article, Pepsico, presents a good example how both agents of change are acting out in the real world. Fears of the governments potential regulation is forcing the company to proactively remove food dangerous dyes from its chips and eventually its entire product portfolio. And just this week, the company finalized a deal to acquire emerging BFY soda company Poppi for $1.95B — a signal that Pepsico knows there is growing and potentially canniballizing demand for a healthier soda option than its Pepsi pops. Pepsico is a co, and they don’t care if you’re spending money slurping sugary sodas or potentially gut healing beverages, as long as your spending money with them. </p><p><em>Elliot Hershberg for Century of Bio</em></p><blockquote><p><em>But I want you take a leap with me that will potentially annoy some drug developers: no discovery technology is immune from the inescapable pull towards commoditization—like virtually every other technology. For big and small molecules alike, once discovery technologies—whether it’s high-throughput screening, in silico screening, in vitro or in vivo models, or an analytical assay—become standardized, companies around the world will compete to offer them as a service. This is The Long Arc of Modality Commoditization. Over time, revolutionary ideas become universal building blocks for the next wave of innovation.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/85415a75-cee4-4d1c-8923-cda129c6d35a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1909180e-8c37-4393-97af-0ff35ed9064b_1232x928.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>Packy again.

So we hit the trifecta here. And this is legitimately one of my favorite Elliot essays, a glimpse into what makes him so good. </span></p><p><span>He argues that as drug discovery technologies get commoditized (today, drug discovery is happening on the cheap in China, and US Pharma is sourcing molecules there), biotech may have to compete more like traditional businesses. Instead of relying on a Cornered Resource in the form of IP as its only moat, biotech companies will need to </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c92a8517-6b3d-442a-a238-e2c0b116482f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">dig moats</a><span> like the rest of us. Because of data flywheels in algorithm-designed drugs, we may see the first drugs that benefit from Network Economies. Process Power and Brand are also on the </span><em>7 Powers </em><span>table. </span></p><p>But Elliot also thinks there’s an opportunity for new entrants to use modern technology to take on sclerotic (a word I stole from him) Pharma incumbents and “establish themselves as an entirely new generation of pharmaceutical company.” In other words, he writes that we might start to see Bio Vertical Integrators. </p><p>As he points out, the path is a hard one. Capital formation will be hard. Doing a lot of things well, all at once, will be hard. Building a standalone business instead of selling assets to Big Pharma will be hard. But, he writes, “If the companies solving these global problems establish moats in new ways, we could see the first $1T+ biotech firms come into existence.”</p><p>Long story short: commoditized drug discovery is good for those of us who take medicine to get healthy. And if it’s short-term painful for certain companies in the space, it may spur creative destruction in the industry that’s good for us all.</p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/de8b8935-854b-49c0-a38f-fb24c709e959?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ZPUtA3W-7_I\"></a><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on Lex Fridman this week for a three hour long conversation about his life, worldview, India, and the state of the world today. Despite some fair criticisms, I’ve long been an admirer of Modi, after all he is the leader of the largest democracy in human history and has done a pretty darn good job of governing India over the last 12 years. But, admittedly, I have never heard him talk before. He governs in Hindi and his mother tongue is Gujarati. Lex now does this cool thing, in partnership with Eleven Labs, to dub foreign language conversations into English in a way that seems to capture and translate the original essence of the conversation. You don’t really hear modern American politicians speak the way Modi does and its quite refreshing. If you have a few hours to kill this week, highly recommend.</p><p>Have a great weekend y’all.</p><p>We’ll be back in your inbox next week.</p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>Packy + Dan </p></div>",

Our bad. We mean “</span><em>efficiencies.</em><span>” Anyway, generally, yes, whether its synergies or efficiencies, </span><em>these</em><span> pros failed to realize either. Per the first day declaration of </span><strong>Accordion Partners LLC</strong><span>’s (“Accordion”) Head of Turnaround &amp; Restructuring and Senior Managing Director </span><strong>Andrew Hede</strong><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Since completing multiple acquisitions, the business has experienced a series of ongoing operational and integration challenges that have negatively impacted operations and financial performance. After acquiring several new business units in an approximately 15-month period, the Debtors have not been able to fully integrate its </em><span>[sic]</span><em> various business units. Many of the operating practices of the legacy Air Pros business have not been applied to acquired business units. Combined with other challenges, the businesses have underperformed. For example, each business unit has an individualized operating model, which leads to lack of controls, different operating philosophies and margins, and a lack of economies of scale.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And of course there is the debt. Specifically there’s $250.4mm of pre-petition secured debt comprised of (i) a ~$196.9mm term loan, (ii) an initial ~$23.5mm revolving facility (which was subsequently upsized in November ‘24 by another $11mm) and (iii) an additional $2.5mm bridge loan funded the week before filing. Below that the debtors also owe general unsecured creditors ~$45mm (inclusive of $17.1mm in aggregate amount of contingent, unliquidated, and disputed obligations emanating out of the debtors’ various acquisitions). Mr. Hede wasn’t kind enough to provide us with pre-petition operational metrics but he does say that the debt was crushing — so much so that the debtors were unable to satisfy their obligations under the ‘22-placed credit facility and ultimately defaulted, leading to acceleration. </p><p><span>Before we talk some more about the debt and that ominous default, we wouldn’t want to leave you with the impression that all of this trouble struck suddenly, like lightening (⚡️). Nope, </span><strong>Jefferies LLC</strong><span> (“Jefferies”) started shopping this thing around to potential strategic buyers and sponsors in </span><em>the summer of ‘23</em><span>. That’s right, </span><em>‘23</em><span>. Things merely got worse from there. </span></p><p><span>Which gets us back to that debt. On January 31, 2024, </span><strong>Alter Domus US LLC </strong><span>(“Alter Domus”), acting as pre-petition agent on behalf of the pre-petition lenders, (i) delivered a notice of default, (ii) exercised proxy rights under the credit agreement, (iii) sh*tcanned the company’s founder and CEO </span><strong>Anthony Perera</strong><span>,*** and (iv) installed bankruptcy (and board flip) veteran </span><strong>Lawrence Hirsh</strong><span> as independent manager.**** Accordion has been in there since March of ‘24 and Mr. Hede has been CRO since September ‘24.***** Jefferies got invited back to the party for a second bite at the apple in October ‘24. With a full roster of RX professionals,****** the debtors were ready to rock and roll and get things back on track. </span></p><p>So what track is that, exactly? More sale stuff! Here’s the mic Mr. Hede:</p><blockquote><p><em>“After evaluating the alternatives, the Debtors concluded that the best path forward to maximize the value of the Debtors’ assets was a break-up sale of the businesses.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Multiple sale stuff, actually!! Mr. Hede added: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Through this most recent and ongoing process, the Debtors have received several formal offers that will serve as baseline, stalking horse bids for the Debtors’ assets, subject to higher and better bids pursuant to court-approved bidding procedures. The Debtors intend to file a motion seeking approval of proposed bidding and auction procedures within the first several days of these Chapter 11 Cases, which will, among other things, identify the stalking horse bidders and set forth the material terms of the stalking horse bids, including the specific assets being acquired.”</em></p></blockquote><p>A sale process, of course, requires money and so, of course, there’s a proposed DIP and motion to seek the use of cash collateral. The headline number of the DIP is $20mm but only $10mm is new money ($4mm interim, roll-up dollar-for-dollar, multiple delayed draw term loan). The DIP carries a SOFR+11.5% interest rate and a 3% closing fee against the new money (PIK). The DIP terms include liens on avoidance actions (at final order stage) and other now-typical waivers that may benefit the secured lenders to the benefit of unsecured creditors. Moreover, the prepetition lenders preserved their right to credit bid. We’d previously mentioned that Mr. Hede wasn’t kind enough to regale us with pre-petition operating results but, naturally, we can see from the DIP budget where this company stands: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1b39258b-4d5f-4f82-9e46-3012791942a2?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff787e634-eac9-4433-b2a6-ef973775a7ed_966x577.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 17-2. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Yeah, sans a DIP stat, you can see how there’d be “</span><em>immediate and irreparable harm.</em><span>” </span></p><p><span>As for timing, this budget subsumes the entirety of the process. The debtors intend to have one or more auctions for the sale of all or substantially all of their assets by May 12, 2025, with a sale hearing to be held on May 19, 2025; they hope to have an order confirming a plan of liquidation by June 24, 2025. In other words, the events will, subject to an obstreperous official committee of unsecured creditors, transpire “</span><em>suddenly, like lightening</em><span>” (⚡️). </span></p><p>In addition to other relief, Judge Baisier entered an interim order authorizing the DIP and cash collateral use on an interim basis on March 18, 2025. </p><p><span>The debtors are represented by </span><strong>Greenberg Traurig LLP</strong><span> (David Kurzweil, Matthew Petrie) as legal counsel and the aforementioned Accordion and Jefferies (Jeffrey Finger) as restructuring advisor and investment banker, respectively.

Yeaaaahhhhhh, this time it was 41¢ a pop, which pegged the company’s value at roundabouts $12.1mm or 0.2% of its once $6b market cap (😬).

But even at the time she made her generous 41¢ overture, the stock was nearly 4x higher than her proposal. So, of course, it went absolutely nowhere. Like, what was she expecting? </p><p><span>But she wasn’t done. On March 6, 2025, she tossed in another proposal at 41¢ cash </span><em>plus</em><span> three contingent value rights (“CVRs”), representing the </span><em>potential </em><span>to receive an additional $2.53 per share. The payment of the CVRs is tied to future revenue milestones, and if they all hit, that’d be a premium over the stock price. But, as the old saying goes, the devil’s always in the details. Here’s what the CVRs require:</span></p><ul><li><p>To earn another 67¢ per share, revenue in FY26 (ending March 31, 2026) has to exceed $224 million;</p></li><li><p>For another 84¢ per share, revenue in FY27 (ending March 31, 2027) has to exceed $295 million; and</p></li><li><p>And finally, for another $1.01 per share, revenue in FY28 (ending March 31, 2028) has to exceed $367 million.</p></li></ul><p>These are lofty-a$$ goals. For the 9 months ended December 31, 2024, the company’s revenue was down 5% YoY, from $134mm to $128mm, and FY24 (ending March 31, 2024) had a total revenue of $219.6mm. If that same pattern holds, FY25 should end up landing around $208.6mm. Both would be a far cry from prior years, which landed at $299.5mm in FY23, $271.9mm in FY22, and $243.9mm in FY21.</p><p>Even if that first payment is obtainable — it’s at least not ridiculous — the company needs to achieve revenues it’s only beaten once to get that 84¢, and the last $1.01 requires a figure 22.5% higher than the highest revenue year the company’s ever had.</p><p>We wouldn’t blame stockholders if they didn’t put a lot of value on those CVRs. We certainly wouldn’t, but we’re somehow still not done.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bc0c0557-e240-49aa-9728-326bf8e75c09?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c1cd09-d520-485f-936e-0540231fefff_480x262.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>At the request of the special committee, she took yet another turn at the proposal and, on March 10, 2025, added her willingness to lend $20mm at 7% to fund operations, to be offset dollar-for-dollar by any future financing she is able to raise. It was otherwise identical to the prior offer. Maybe that tweak means something to the special committee, but why would shareholders care? They’re getting bought out, and loans aren’t revenue (duh).</p><p><span>If history is any indication, we could easily be blessed with more rounds of this back and forth — or maybe the special committee’s directors take a page from their predecessors and resign too.

In the two-odd months the debtors have been in bankruptcy, the docket has been blasted with over 1,150 entries, and the story continues to be more of the same: the company is a bottomless cash pit with no clear way out of bankruptcy and so we’re at a point where professionals are throwing sh*t at the wall to see what sticks.</span></p><p><span>Since we last saw y’all on this name, a lot’s unfolded, but let’s start with the real easy stuff. The debtors got themselves a patient care ombudsman — </span><strong>Suzanne Koenig</strong><span>* — and the US trustee appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors.** The latter retained </span><strong>Paul Hastings LLP</strong><span> (Kristopher Hansen, Erez Gilad, Gabriel Sasson, Emily Kuznick, John Iaffaldano, Charles Persons) as legal counsel, </span><strong>Jefferies LLC</strong><span> (Leon Szlezinger) as investment banker, and </span><strong>Province, LLC</strong><span> (Paul Navid), as financial advisor. You’ve really gotta love bankruptcy: even when there’s a disastrous burning building, pros will run in headfirst so long as there’s the prospect of uncovering a treasure trove down the hallway. </span></p><p>Turning to harder items, we’ll begin at the DIP. </p><p><span>At the first day hearing, the debtors surprised their landlord and secured creditor </span><strong>Medical Properties Trust, Inc. ($MPW) </strong><span>(“MPT”) with a $100mm, priming facility provided by then-newcomer-to-the-cap-stack </span><strong>JMB Capital Partners Lending, LLC</strong><span> (“JMB”), which the court approved over MPT’s objection because the debtors intended to challenge MPT’s leases as unsecured disguised financings. Well, what do you know, peace has broken out through a “</span><em>global” </em><span>settlement. Under it, MPT is consenting to JMB’s DIP and kicking in its own </span><em>junior</em><span> DIP, consisting of an up-to $25mm new money term loan (at 16%), </span><em>plus</em><span> a roll-up of MPT’s $75mm in prepetition term loans (at 11.5%), </span><em>plus</em><span> the monthly accrual of $5mm to MPT in lieu of current interest and rent, </span><em>plus</em><span> amounts owed to MPT’s professionals. The new money’s got a 4% PIK financing fee and a 6% PIK exit fee, earned upon entry of an order approving the settlement. That settlement also creates a single recovery waterfall across all debtors (under which MPT is only behind the other DIPs) and gives MPT rights with respect to the debtors’ multitude of sale processes (discussed below), like being able to flat-out reject any bid that involves one of its leases and on which it doesn’t give a thumbs-up. </span></p><p><span>But notice how we put “</span><em>global</em><span>” in quotations ☝️. Typically the term implies that everyone’s signed off on it, but you know who's not thrilled about all that sh*t? The UCC, which tossed in an objection that the settlement is “</span><em>a plan of reorganization premised on substantive consolidation and allows MPT to recover on its disputed — and significantly inflated — claims with proceeds of asset sales outside of a chapter 11 plan.</em><span>” Global or not, it’ll all come to a head later today, where the court will consider the junior DIP, the “global” settlement, and a bid procedures motion (discussed below).</span></p><p><span>We mentioned a “</span><em>multitude of sale processes,</em><span>” so sure, let’s turn to the debtors’ ongoing efforts to shove their money-hemorrhaging hospitals onto someone else. Going chronologically, the first was their late January ‘25 motion to privately sell their Pennsylvania assets to “</span><em>a non-profit entity formed to serve the health care needs of Delaware Country</em><span> [sic]</span><em> for this purpose</em><span>.” Seem a bit vague? Yeah, the debtors’ sublandlord, the non-profit </span><strong>Foundation of Delaware County (PA)</strong><span> (the “Foundation”),*** thought so too and filed an objection over failure to include small details like (i) the identity of the purchaser, (ii) its capitalization, (iii) a list of contracts to be assumed and assigned, (iv) a proposed asset purchase agreement, (v) a form of order, and (vi) the terms of a settlement to be baked into the sale.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4ae797cf-8bd2-47fe-b2fc-aa156967d5f6?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e2f4901-c7a0-4fc6-bfaa-7fef7ec8edeb_480x400.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY. Yeah, nothing unreasonable about that objection.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>That sale’s still technically pending, but true to form, the debtors were experiencing an “</span><em>unsustainable liquidity crisis</em><span>,” so about a week after filing the motion, on February 5, 2025, they followed up with a “</span><em>stipulation and agreed order</em><span>” to appoint </span><strong>FTI Consulting, Inc. ($FCN)</strong><span> (“FTI”) as receiver for the PA hospitals, which would keep hospital doors open through March 14, 2025.**** The Foundation objected to that too, but faced with a loser of a company like this and the Pennsylvania AG’s support, Judge Jernigan didn’t have too many options: she got right comfortable with the arrangement, comparing it to a trustee, before officially signing the order on February 7, 2025.</span></p><p><span>But we’re obviously past March 14, 2025, so you might want to know what happened next. A week before the outside date, on March 6, 2025, the court held a status conference to get the 411 and learned the debtors would be filing a motion to close the PA hospitals later that day (which they did) because, once again, they burned through the financing at hand. Displeased with that outcome, Judge Jernigan repeatedly expressed her desire for a “</span><em>hero</em><span>” to surface, and it seemed like she had one in mind: the Foundation itself, which she pressed </span><em>HARD</em><span> to find a way to fill that role. How? Back in ‘16, the debtors and the Foundation got intertwined through the debtors’ purchase of Pennsylvania-based hospitals, for which the Foundation received upwards of $55mm,***** and the court wasn’t afraid to entertain (and throw around) a few suggestions of transaction-related claims that could exist.******</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5d38247e-6226-40e0-b1e1-c7a21d290e52?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92127182-b000-4ad0-b666-030ee0a3a6dd_480x270.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>She also forced the conversation to continue outside the courtroom, ordering the debtors, the Pennsylvania AG, and the Foundation to hold “</span><em>settlement discussions</em><span>” before March 10, 2025. But hey, either cooler heads prevailed or Her Honor’s bullying worked; on March 11, 2025, everyone headed back to court, where the debtors were just delighted to share that Foundation had reached into its pocket and found an undisclosed amount of cash to fund the PA hospitals’ receivership a bit longer — two weeks for now, subject to further conversations about a longer-term solution.*******</span></p><p><span>Rewinding back to early February ‘25 for the second motion, the debtors also teed up a sale of their Rhode Island assets to </span><strong>The Centurion Foundation, Inc.</strong><span> and </span><strong>CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Inc.</strong><span> That one went a lot smoother, but it wasn’t without controversy — </span><strong>Fifth Third Securities, Inc.</strong><span> (“Fifth Third”) tossed in an objection.******** What’s Fifth Third’s connection to the cases? Back in ‘21, the debtors hired them to serve as their “</span><em>exclusive investment banker and financial advisor</em><span>” and identified those buyers, but the proposed sale didn’t include their fee. You know who would get a fee for the sale? The debtors’ (bankruptcy) investment banker, </span><strong>Houlihan Lokey, Inc. ($HLI)</strong><span>. LOL, talk about adding insult to injury — not only did Fifth Third get shafted, but someone else is getting paid for the work. The audio for that hearing was never published, but we imagine the court told them to shut up and file their (worthless) GUC claim against the estates because it docketed a signed sale order the next day, which should net the estates about $25mm (after purchase price adjustments) to burn.</span></p><p><span>Finally, on February 18, 2025, the debtors dropped a third sale-focused motion on the docket — this time for their California and Connecticut assets — subject, refreshingly, to an actual bidding process. Well, like a generic diet cola level of refreshing; there’s no stalking horse. This is the one that drew the UCC’s ire. It didn’t love the special rights and privileges MPT’s set up to receive and the parts that bake in the “</span><em>global</em><span>” settlement (e.g., credit biddings). That motion is also slated to be heard later today, so folks can fight about it, the DIP, and the settlement in one, probably-painfully-long-go. But if the debtors get the go-ahead, bidders will get to enjoy these murky-a$$ deadlines:</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a535602d-ad96-4ebd-b81d-3a1cd65d6c31?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F800331ac-b887-4933-a2e3-a47315eeb7f0_787x486.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 708</figcaption></figure></div><p>Really, just one more example of the total chaos that these cases are. But maybe that was predestined — hard to imagine something better when day 1 serves up a priming DIP that prepetition lenders weren’t told about. To be frank, we’re hoping this business sells ASAP. And no, not because we’re overly focused on patients receiving the care they need (although we hope they do), but because keeping up with this dumpster fire has already occupied too many hours of our lives.

In 1968, Paul Ehrlich, a lepidopterist, and\r\nhis largely uncredited wife, Anne, published a best-seller called “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPopulation-Explosion-Paul-R-Ehrlich%2Fdp%2F0671732943%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fcrid%3D1A7CE4RH0CNFZ%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6P9Y0jvIZPRoSjcxNrOthZfbGCLcPfqLHJGIwL8yD5PbUsolq5iU2JpcVgVwO37kOFZ2LUeJRBvgxlZqyAISaXiFbNm7FgMmoTGlz3Q8Ga0VgFBGcUyNfM7OMcFU4YpXtqzW2POXOGWU5kY1HVP_K91cRm47GmpnouprwPzB6z_UB2ewVhJSgb51WFruc_eQJVh1VVnIGE0kxGl22reN_fcDssoSL1kUXqKNb51LVJo.rEkvaEF7S-ZZNiX_jiYZE4EvYABxFLTRDOa72MOxls4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dthe%2520population%2520bomb%2520paul%2520ehrlich%26qid%3D1740174821%26sprefix%3DThe%2520Population%2520Bomb%2Caps%2C158%26sr%3D8-2\"><span>The Population Bomb</span></a>.” For\r\ncenturies, economists had worried that the world’s food supply could not\r\npossibly be expected to keep pace with the growing mobs of people. Now there\r\nwas no postponing our fate. “The battle to feed all of humanity is over,”\r\nEhrlich wrote. “In the 1970s the world will undergo famines—hundreds of\r\nmillions of people are going to starve to death.” This was the received wisdom\r\nof the era: a decade earlier, an only slightly flippant article in <i>Science</i> estimated\r\nthat in November, 2026, the global population would approach infinity. Ehrlich\r\nprescribed a few sane proposals—the legalization of abortion, investments in\r\ncontraception research, and sex education—but he also floated the idea of\r\nspiking the water supply with temporary sterilants. Americans might protest\r\nsuch extreme measures, he allowed, but people in foreign countries should have\r\nno choice. It was only reasonable that food aid be conditioned on the\r\ndeveloping world’s ability to exhibit civilized restraint. Nations that\r\ntolerated a free-for-all of unrepentant copulation—he singled out India—would\r\nbe left to fend for themselves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>“The Population Bomb” transformed regional unease into a\r\nglobal panic. India, in less than two years, subjected millions of citizens to\r\ncompulsory sterilization. China rolled out a series of initiatives—culminating\r\nin the infamous one-child policy—that included punitive fines, obligatory IUD\r\ninsertions, and unwanted abortions. Ehrlich can hardly be blamed for the most\r\ncoercive incarnations of population control. He might, however, be accused of\r\nimpeccable comic timing. By the time “The Population Bomb” was published, the\r\npopulation-growth rate had already peaked. For hundreds of thousands of years,\r\nwe had gone forth and multiplied. This epoch was coming to an end.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The “total fertility rate” is a coarse estimate of the\r\nnumber of children an average woman will bear. A population will be stable if\r\nit reproduces at the “replacement rate,” or about 2.1 babies per mother. (The\r\n.1 is the statistical laundering of great personal tragedy.) Anything above\r\nthat threshold will theoretically generate exponential expansion, and anything\r\nbelow it will generate exponential decay. In 1960, the tiny country of\r\nSingapore had a fertility rate of almost six. By 1985, it had been brought down\r\nto 1.6—a rate that threatened to roughly halve its population in two\r\ngenerations. As the economist Nicholas Eberstadt told me, “For two decades, the\r\nleaders of Singapore said, ‘Oh, uncontrolled fertility has terribly dangerous\r\nconsequences, so the rate has to come down,’ and then, after a semicolon,\r\nwithout even catching their breath, said, ‘Wait, I mean go up.’ ” The\r\nnation’s leaders launched a promotional campaign: “Have-Three-or-More (if you\r\ncan afford it).” Singaporeans were known to be good national sports, but,\r\ndespite the catchiness of the slogan, they proved noncompliant. From one nation\r\nto the next, the nightmare of too many descendants turned into the nightmare of\r\ntoo few. In 2007, when Japan’s total fertility rate hit 1.3, a conservative government\r\nminister referred to women as “birth-giving machines.” This didn’t go over\r\nparticularly well with anyone, including his wife.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Today, declining fertility is a near-universal phenomenon.\r\nAlbania, El Salvador, and Nepal, none of them affluent, are now below\r\nreplacement levels. Iran’s fertility rate is half of what it was thirty years\r\nago. Headlines about “Europe’s demographic winter” are commonplace. Giorgia\r\nMeloni, the Prime Minister of Italy, has said that her country is “destined to\r\ndisappear.” One Japanese economist runs a conceptual clock that counts down to\r\nhis country’s final child: the current readout is January 5, 2720.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>It will take a few years before we can be sure, but it’s\r\npossible that 2023 saw the world as a whole slump beneath the replacement\r\nthreshold for the first time. There are a couple of places where fertility\r\nremains higher—Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa—but even there the rates are\r\ngenerally diminishing. Paranoia has ensued. In the past year, hundreds of men\r\nin the Central African Republic have reported the presumably delusional belief\r\nthat their genitals have gone missing. In Nigeria, where the fertility rate has\r\nfallen from seven to four, a widely read tabloid blamed a conspiracy of\r\nperverts in the French intelligence services who had been “using secret\r\nnanotechnology innovations to steal penises from African men in order to\r\nreverse the extinction of Europeans unwilling to bear children.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The phenomenon exerts a peculiarly deranging force, and\r\nuntil recently Americans remained oblivious. In the past two decades, however,\r\nthe American fertility rate has dropped roughly twenty per cent, to 1.6. The\r\nright wing sees depopulation as a greater threat than climate change. Elon Musk\r\ndescribes it as “the biggest danger civilization faces by far,” and is trying,\r\nin his quiet way, to compensate on his own. He has sired, at least in a\r\ntechnical sense, thirteenish known children, and has reportedly offered the\r\ndispensation of his sperm to friends, employees, and people he met once at a\r\ndinner party. (Musk denies this. Skeptics of the strategy, though, might recall\r\nthat <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F01%2F01%2Fempires-of-the-steppes-the-nomadic-tribes-who-shaped-civilization-kenneth-harl-book-review\"><span>Genghis Khan</span></a>, according\r\nto legend, had more than a thousand offspring.) Vice-President <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F11%2F04%2Fj-d-vance-profile\"><span>J. D. Vance</span></a> has\r\nblamed this “catastrophic problem” on the “childless left.” Liberals more often\r\ndismiss the issue, not without reason, as scaremongering in service of the\r\nRepublican assault on reproductive rights. Some go further: a dwindling\r\npopulation is a more environmentally sustainable one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Anyone who offers a confident explanation of the situation\r\nis probably wrong. Fertility connects perhaps the most significant decision any\r\nindividual might make with unanswerable questions about our collective fate, so\r\na theory of fertility is necessarily a theory of everything—gender, money,\r\npolitics, culture, evolution. Eberstadt told me, “The person who explains it\r\ndeserves to get a Nobel, not in economics but in literature.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The global population is projected to grow for about\r\nanother half century. Then it will contract. This is unprecedented. Almost\r\nnothing else can be said with any certainty. Here and there, however, are\r\nharbingers of potential futures. South Korea has a fertility rate of 0.7. This\r\nis the lowest rate of any nation in the world. It may be the lowest in recorded\r\nhistory. If that trajectory holds, each successive generation will be a third\r\nthe size of its predecessor. Every hundred contemporary Koreans of childbearing\r\nage will produce, in total, about twelve grandchildren. The country is an\r\noutlier, but it may not be one for long. As the Korean political analyst John\r\nLee told me, “We are the canary in the coal mine.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Seoul, an endless, futuristic sprawl of Samsung- and\r\nLG-fabricated high-rises, an imminent shortage of people seems preposterous.\r\nThe capital city’s metropolitan area, home to twenty-six million citizens, or\r\nabout half of all South Koreans, is perhaps the most densely settled region in\r\nthe industrialized world. When I visited, in November, I was advised to\r\nwithdraw my phone from my pocket on the metro platform, because it would be\r\nimpossible to do so once on board the train. Fuchsia metro seats are reserved\r\nfor pregnant women. Those who aren’t yet showing are awarded special medallions\r\nas proof of gestation. A looping instructional video reminded passengers of the\r\nproper etiquette. Even amid the rush-hour crush, these seats were often left\r\nvacant. They seemed to represent less a practical consideration than an act of\r\nunanchored faith—like a place for Elijah at a Seder table.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><span>“Stay . . .”</span></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cartoon\r\nby Patrick McKelvie</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Link copied</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shop</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Portents of desolation are everywhere. Middle-aged Koreans\r\nremember a time when children were plentiful. In 1970, a million Korean babies\r\nwere born. An average baby-boomer classroom had seventy or eighty pupils, and\r\nschools were forced to divide their students into morning and afternoon shifts.\r\nIt is as though these people were residents of a different country. In 2023,\r\nthe number of births was just two hundred and thirty thousand. A baby-formula\r\nbrand has retooled itself to manufacture muscle-retention smoothies for the\r\nelderly. About two hundred day-care facilities have been turned into nursing\r\nhomes, sometimes with the same directors, the same rubberized play floors, and\r\nthe same crayons. A rural school has been repurposed as a cat sanctuary. Every\r\nKorean has heard that their population will ineluctably approach zero. Cho\r\nYoungtae, a celebrity demographer at Seoul National University, said to me,\r\n“Ask people on the street, ‘What is the Korean total fertility rate?’ and they\r\nwill know!” They often know to two decimal places. They have a celebrity\r\ndemographer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Outside of Seoul, children are largely phantom presences.\r\nThere are a hundred and fifty-seven elementary schools that had no new\r\nenrollees scheduled for 2023. That year, the seaside village of Iwon-myeon\r\nrecorded a single newborn. The entire town was garlanded with banners that\r\ncongratulated the parents by name “on the birth of their lovely baby angel.”\r\nOne village in Haenam, a county that encompasses the southern extremity of the\r\nKorean peninsula, last registered a birth during the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Haenam disappears into the sea at a windswept cape called\r\nTtangkkeut, or “End of the World.” Not far away, there is a school that once\r\nhad more than a thousand elementary-age students. When I visited, in November,\r\nit had five. A pastel rainbow brightened the façade, and out front was a statue\r\nof a singlet-clad boy with a raised torch; the plinth’s inscription read\r\n“Physical strength is national strength.” A pair of slippers had been left for\r\nme at the entryway, beside a trophy case crowded with bygone glories and a\r\nlaminated poster that introduced the names and career aspirations of the three\r\nfirst graders (policeman, architect, idol singer) and the two sixth graders\r\n(truck driver, fighter pilot). In a memorable scene in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2006\r\nfilm, “Children of Men,” a dystopian vision of a sterile world, a deer bounds\r\nthrough a trash-strewn school hallway. Here, dereliction was kept at bay: the\r\ncorridors were bright, broom-swept, and freshly painted. The former chambers of\r\na departed principal, dusted as if in anticipation of parent conferences, were\r\nspectral; the empty room next door had a hulking public-address console, with\r\nfive microphones set at varying heights. It was as if everyone had evaporated\r\novernight.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The school administrator, Lee Youngmi, efficiently if\r\nwarily welcomed me into a main office lined with spotless devices—a\r\nspiral-binding machine, a laminator—and offered me ginger tea and cookies. When\r\nshe’d first arrived, ten years ago, there were sixty students. But the\r\nsurrounding town had since drained away. The large cattle market, which used to\r\nbe candlelit until well after dark, is gone, as are the brewery, the lumber\r\nmill, the police station, and the post office. Parents fought to preserve the school\r\nas a center of civic life, but their children now complained that there was no\r\none left to play with. Teachers called the current group of students, in a\r\nreference to an old Korean superhero cartoon, the Eagle Five Brothers. Lee was\r\naccustomed to solitude. When she left me in the room, she reflexively flicked\r\noff the heating.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The sixth-grade teacher, Kang Wooyoung, a man in his\r\ntwenties, had a similar air of resignation. His two students had been together\r\nsince they reached school age. When I asked if they got along, he seemed\r\nbaffled by the question: they fought sometimes, sure, but they didn’t know any\r\nother children their age. “The advantage is that I can be super intimate with\r\nthe students,” he said. “The disadvantage is that they cannot learn to\r\nsocialize in a group setting.” One of his sixth graders was disabled; a special-education\r\nteacher was retained on his behalf, but the line item was hard to justify. The\r\npatterns of the children’s lives were unlikely to be upended by the arrival of\r\na strange new kid or the torment of an unapproachable crush. The school may be\r\nclosing next year. Kang had loved his first teaching job, his own childhood\r\ndream. But he didn’t have any friends in town, either.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The\r\nafter-school program was about to start. It featured two options: 3-D printing\r\nand something Lee called “a new sport.” She could give me no details on the new\r\nsport, which was played on Tuesdays. In the past, they had offered volleyball,\r\nbadminton, and soccer, but such extravagances required a critical mass. She let\r\nme wander the school, which felt like a museum of childhood artifacts: an unlit\r\nbut well-stocked gymnasium, a darkened cafeteria outfitted with a little\r\nproscenium stage, enormous forsaken playgrounds, ballfields gone wild. The only\r\napparent concession to the demographic reality was a robotic apparatus for\r\nplaying Ping-Pong by yourself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The end of the world is usually dramatized as convulsive\r\nand feverish, but population loss is an apocalypse on an installment plan. At\r\none point in “Children of Men,” the protagonist, played by Clive Owen, regards\r\na private archive of cultural treasures—Michelangelo’s “David,” Picasso’s\r\n“Guernica”—and turns to its proprietor to say, “A hundred years from now there\r\nwon’t be one sad fuck to look at any of this. What keeps you going?” The man\r\nresponds, “I just don’t think about it.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Hysteria about the number of children is often an alibi for\r\nhysteria about who is having them. In the first decades of the Roman Empire,\r\nAugustus Caesar grew fixated on the decadent urban élite’s apparent refusal to\r\nperpetuate itself. The patrician class, he said, was betraying the country “by\r\nrendering her barren”; to deny their ancestors the immortality of their lineage\r\nwas an act “worse than murder.” In 9 <span>A.D.</span>,\r\nhe legislated that high-status men who remained single by the age of\r\ntwenty-five would forfeit their inheritances. In addition, the élites were\r\nforbidden to marry actors. Their infertility probably owed less to dalliances\r\nwith thespians than it did to the presence of lead in their utensils,\r\ncosmetics, and pipes. Either way, their biological legacies were in fact\r\nextinguished: imperial Roman urbanites left little detectable genetic trace in\r\nsubsequent Europeans. The population as a whole, however, was fine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Aside from the blips of the Mongol invasions, <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2005%2F03%2F21%2Fthe-end-of-the-world\"><span>the Black Death</span></a>, and the\r\nThirty Years’ War, the human number in Eurasia grew steadily, if slowly, for\r\nthe bulk of the next two millennia. As the economist Thomas Malthus famously\r\nobserved, the only effective deterrent to the otherwise consuming “passion\r\nbetween the sexes” was the fear that one’s children would starve to death.\r\nFamilies were just large enough to compensate for the fact that nearly half of\r\nall babies born would never celebrate their fifth birthday. In about 1805, we\r\ncrossed the threshold of a billion people. That had taken the entirety of human\r\nhistory. Our next billion took just a hundred and twenty-three years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>This population explosion coincided, oddly, with a downward\r\nfertility drift in Europe. The pioneers were French aristocrats: in the\r\ninterest of consolidating familial wealth and prestige, the nobility\r\nincreasingly delayed marriage, and then sought to limit the number of offspring\r\nwho might expect their share of an inheritance. This made sense. But the\r\npractices diffused, through mimicry, to the lower orders. This made less sense.\r\nEvolutionary imperatives, it seemed, could be eclipsed by cultural contagion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>By the twentieth century, more rational explanations had\r\ncaught up. An industrializing economy no longer required children to help on\r\nthe farm. Women were free to enter the workplace. At the same time,\r\nimprovements in medicine and sanitation radically reduced the rate of childhood\r\nmortality. Children became capital assets, and investments in their education\r\nwere understood to beget healthy returns. Economists likened this to other\r\nconsumer durables: as families get richer, they don’t just keep buying cars; they\r\nbuy nicer ones.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>If economic prosperity decreased fertility, it seemed\r\nintuitive that lower fertility should, in turn, increase prosperity. During the\r\nCold War, population control came to be seen as a kind of master key—a panacea\r\nfor social and political ills. In a forthcoming book, “Toxic Demography,” the\r\nscholar Jennifer Sciubba and her co-authors write that American élites believed\r\n“population growth caused poverty, and poverty caused communism.” It was in the\r\nbest interests of the West, leaders such as President <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2019%2F01%2F28%2Fthe-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives\"><span>Lyndon Johnson</span></a> affirmed,\r\nto subsidize the proliferation of birth control and sex education. It was\r\nunfortunate but apparently unavoidable that the principal instrument of family\r\nplanning was the female body. The president of <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2023%2F05%2F15%2Fthe-problem-with-planned-parenthood\"><span>Planned Parenthood</span></a>, an\r\norganization founded in alignment with the eugenicist sympathies of\r\nearly-twentieth-century progressive movements, warned that an overly precious\r\nconcern for “individual women” would impede progress: “We dare not lose sight\r\nof our goals—to apply this method to large populations.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>South Korea stood at the vanguard. A decade after the\r\nKorean War, the country’s per-capita G.D.P. was below a hundred dollars—less\r\nthan that of Haiti. People ate tree bark or boiled grass, and children begged\r\nin the streets. After a military coup in 1961, the new authoritarian leadership\r\ntied its economic program to the cultivation of a citizenry that was smaller\r\nand better educated. It was an all-hands-on-deck approach to the labor force.\r\nSocial workers fanned out to rural communities, where they encouraged women to\r\nhave no more than three children. The government legalized contraceptives and\r\npressed for the use of IUDs. These initiatives dovetailed with an emphasis on\r\nethnic homogeneity and traditionalist values. Biracial children of American\r\nservicemen, along with the children of unwed mothers, were shipped abroad for\r\nadoption, and Korea became known as the world’s largest “exporter” of babies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The program was regarded as a smashing success. In the span\r\nof twenty years, Korea’s fertility rate went from six to replacement, a feat\r\ndescribed by Asian demographers as “one of the most spectacular and fastest\r\ndeclines ever recorded.” A crucial part of this plan was the educational\r\nadvancement of women, which the same demographers called “unprecedented in the\r\nrecent history of the world.” Far fewer Koreans came into existence, but those\r\nwho did enjoyed a similarly improbable rise in their standard of living.\r\nParents who remembered hunger produced children who could afford cosmetic\r\nsurgery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Fertility all of a sudden seemed like a knob that\r\ngovernments could turn at will. It was simply assumed that the “demographic\r\ntransition”—the shift from many deaths and many babies to far fewer of\r\nboth—would settle naturally around the replacement rate. Like a restaurant at\r\ncapacity, our unconscious maître d’s would regulate our numbers on a one-in,\r\none-out basis. It never really occurred to anyone that governments might want\r\nto turn the knob the other way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Except, as a Dutch demographer once dryly put it, “the\r\ndrive in human populations to procreate may long have been over-estimated.”\r\nWhen Korea neared replacement, in 1983, its leadership might have reconsidered\r\nits policies. Instead, it doubled down with a new slogan: “Even two are too\r\nmany.” By 1986, the Korean fertility rate reached 1.6. This remained stable for\r\nabout a decade, then fell off a cliff. The government has now devoted\r\napproximately two hundred and fifty billion dollars to various pro-natalist efforts,\r\nincluding cash transfers and parental-leave extensions, to no avail. Two years\r\nago, the legendary feminist legal scholar Joan Williams was shown the most\r\nrecent Korean fertility data for a documentary. She drew her hands to her face\r\nin open-mouthed shock—like Edvard Munch’s “Scream”—and the image instantly\r\nbecame a meme.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Korea’s demographic collapse is mostly taken as a fait\r\naccompli. As John Lee, the political analyst, put it, “They say South Korea\r\nwill be extinct in a hundred years. Who cares? We’ll all be dead by then.” The\r\ncauses routinely cited include the cost of housing and of child care—among the\r\nhighest in the world. Very little in Korean society seems to give young people\r\nthe impression that child rearing might be rewarding or delightful. I met a\r\nstylish twentysomething news reporter at an airy, silent café in Seoul’s lively\r\nItaewon district. “People hate kids here,” she told me. “They see kids and say,\r\n‘Ugh.’ ” This ambient resentment finds an outlet in disdain for mothers.\r\nShe said, “People call moms ‘bugs’ or ‘parasites.’ If your kids make a little\r\nnoise, someone will glare at you.” She had recently vacationed in Rome, where\r\nadults drank at bars while their kids ran amok. She said, “Here, people would\r\nsay, ‘What the hell are you doing?’ ”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The\r\nonline responses to media accounts of the crisis tend to be aggressively\r\ncynical: “Just wait, we can go lower than that,” or “You can’t just birth the\r\nslaves.” The reporter said, “When I write about this, I think, Well, what would\r\nchange <i>my</i> mind? The answer is nothing. It’s the norm not to\r\nwant kids.” Like many Koreans, she dotes on her dog. Finding gifts in Seoul for\r\nmy two little soccer fanatics at home required deliberate planning—I schlepped\r\nall over town looking for national-team jerseys in child’s sizes and had to\r\nsettle for black-market knockoffs—but there is a pet depot on practically every\r\nblock. Last year, strollers for dogs outsold those for babies. She said, “I’m\r\nnot saying people value dogs more than they value children.” She paused to\r\ngesture to the other patrons: “But all you have to do is look around.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>American conservatives have become preoccupied with\r\nforeshadowings of “civilizational suicide.” A year ago, the <i>Times</i> columnist\r\nRoss Douthat, a father of five, published an opinion piece that invoked the\r\nKorean example as a “warning about what’s possible for us.” America’s birth\r\nrate started to slip in 2008, with the onset of the financial crisis; by 2022,\r\nthe U.S. had caught up, or perhaps caught down, with the Korea of the\r\nnineteen-eighties. Douthat and others see worrisome parallels here: marriage\r\nrates are in retreat; gender polarization is rising; young people aren’t even\r\nhaving sex for fun, let alone productively; the meritocracy is a grind; we’re\r\nall rotting in front of our phones. Douthat has been circumspect about the\r\nissue in a way that <span>MAGA</span> Republicans\r\nare not. The Trump Administration’s new Transportation Secretary has already\r\ninstructed his department to prioritize “communities with marriage and birth\r\nrates higher than the national average.” As the young right-wing activist\r\nCharlie Kirk put it last summer, “The childless are the ones that are\r\ndestroying the country.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><span>“I’m just spitballing, but it might be fun if your next\r\nplay was about a lone skull making his way in the big city.”</span></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cartoon\r\nby Chris Gural</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Link copied</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shop</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A childless vacuum, by this account, is the future liberals\r\nwant. Kirk’s conservative compatriots point to such examples as the young\r\nprogressive activist David Hogg, who once tweeted that he would “much rather\r\nown a Porsche and have a Portuguese water dog and golden doodle” than have\r\nchildren. “Long term it’s cheaper, better for the environment and will never\r\ntell you that it hates you or ask you to pay for college.” These liberal\r\ncaricatures perceive family commitments as a drag on “self-actualization,” which\r\noften becomes an excuse for hedonism. Conservatives instead call for a\r\nrehabilitation of family values. The “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpersons-of-interest%2Fthe-rise-and-fall-of-the-trad-wife\"><span>trad wives</span></a>” of social\r\nmedia make cornflakes from scratch and would never let their husbands milk the\r\ncows. As the self-described “domestic extremist” Peachy Keenan has put it, “The\r\nhome with the mom and dad is the little factory to produce the future, like,\r\nliterally.” Others have reached for more nefarious explanations for languishing\r\nbirth rates. <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2024%2F11%2F11%2Fthe-tucker-carlson-road-show\"><span>Tucker Carlson</span></a> made\r\na documentary about “collapsing testosterone levels” in America; a far-right\r\ninfluencer known as Raw Egg Nationalist blames endocrine disruptors in perfume.\r\nThere is no evidence, however, that the epidemic is one of infecundity. It may\r\nbe wishful to think so: it’s easier to avoid leaden dishware than it is to\r\nreinvigorate a society’s desire for children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The narrative of moral decay also sits uneasily with the\r\nunderlying data. In 2011, forty-five per cent of American pregnancies were\r\nunplanned. This has come down dramatically, in large part owing to an\r\nastonishing reduction in the incidence of teen-age pregnancy. Fresh-faced\r\n“trad” milkmaids, for their part, do not seem to have more children. Where\r\nfemale professional ambition once tracked with smaller families, this is no\r\nlonger the case: in Tunisia and in southern India, where women make up a very\r\nsmall fraction of the labor market, fertility has dropped below replacement.\r\nRecent research indicates that fertility rates now trend higher in countries\r\nwhere more women work. In America, the decline cuts across demographic groups.\r\nEven <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2020%2F03%2F30%2Fhow-joseph-smith-and-the-early-mormons-challenged-american-democracy\"><span>Mormons</span></a> are barely\r\nreplacing themselves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Carlson has accused liberals of a plan to replace\r\nnative-born Americans with immigrants. Even if this were true, it might not be\r\nthe most provident strategy. Studies have shown that newcomers from\r\nhigh-fertility countries tend to adopt the reproductive customs of their host\r\nnation within a generation. Hispanic women account for a large share of\r\nAmerica’s recent fertility decline. Only two communities appear to be\r\nmaintaining very high fertility: ultra-Orthodox Jews and some Anabaptist sects.\r\nThe economist Robin Hanson’s back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that\r\ntwenty-third-century America will be dominated by three hundred million Amish\r\npeople. The likeliest version of the Great Replacement will see a countryside\r\ndotted everywhere with handsome barns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Fertility decline is a polarizing issue in Korea. Lee\r\nJun-seok, a thirty-nine-year-old Harvard graduate who is sometimes compared to\r\nJ. D. Vance, is the most popular conservative politician of his\r\ngeneration. We met late one Friday evening for beer and <i>soju</i>, and\r\nour conversation was interrupted every five minutes by drunk revellers who\r\nbowed deeply to him and took selfies. In the 2022 Korean Presidential race, Lee\r\nhelped mobilize disaffected young men to turn out in support of the\r\nconservative candidate, who promised to abolish the gender ministry, which\r\ncoördinates the country’s equity policies. His victory, in what some observers\r\ncalled the “incel election,” prefigured Trump’s triumph last year. Lee told me,\r\n“When many women get to thirty-five, they start bitching about being duped by\r\nthe feminists who told them they could have it all. It’s literally impossible\r\nfor them to meet someone with the same socioeconomic status at that point, so\r\nthey have to degrade themselves. Now half of us are unmarried, and I’m part of\r\nthat.” When I asked about his American analogue, he said, “J. D. Vance\r\nshould not have been talking in a way that stereotyped people.” He paused, then\r\ncontinued, “Although in Korea there’s more of a reality of childless cat\r\nladies.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>If Koreans aren’t reproducing, it’s not for lack of\r\ntraditionalism. Their culture, as one pro-natalist told me, is already “based.”\r\nPornography and sex work are illegal, and abortion was decriminalized only a\r\nfew years ago. A negligible proportion of Korean babies are born out of\r\nwedlock. Korean men don’t do much at home, and those who do are often branded “<i>pongpongnam</i>,”\r\na reference to dish soap that means “foamy man.” Paternity leave remains\r\nrelatively rare, and men who take it are called “latte papas,” as if they’re\r\nusing the leave as a vacation. Women fear they are assigned low-level\r\nprofessional tasks in anticipation of their departure from the labor force. As\r\nKim Jeongmin, the editorial director of the news organization Korea Pro, told\r\nme, “In H.R. interviews, women feel pressured to show that they’re so dedicated\r\nto their careers that they have no plans to get married.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The insinuation that women are at fault for the demographic\r\ncrisis has turned gender friction into gender war. In 2016, the Korean\r\ngovernment issued a “birth map,” in which, as one blogger put it, “They counted\r\nfertile women like they counted the number of livestock.” A conservative member\r\nof the National Assembly recruited his own chorus line to demonstrate a novel\r\ndance move he thought might help strengthen women’s pelvic floors. Many young\r\nwomen now flirt with the “4B” mentality, a term for those who eschew dating,\r\nsex, marriage, and children; some even forgo friendships with men. Yeho, a\r\nnineteen-year-old sophomore at a prominent women’s college in Seoul, described\r\nthe routine misogyny of her male classmates in high school: boys habitually\r\nrecited lines they’d heard in porn, or illegally circulated pornographic memes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>She had no interest in dating or children. She told me,\r\n“They might not grow up well, or they might fall into an incel community—and,\r\nbesides, children aren’t a necessary part of the good life.” Women in her\r\nmother’s generation often regretted the sacrifices they had been expected to\r\nmake, and they raised their daughters to prioritize their careers. Yeho’s\r\ncollege has an anonymous Reddit-like forum. The basic ground rule, she said,\r\nwas that “to give space to feeling good about men and relationships is to ignore\r\nor minimize the dark side. Posts about heterosexual romance require a trigger\r\nwarning!” The most common such advisory is a derogatory portmanteau of the\r\nwords “love” and “hate.” In one typical reply, a woman wrote, “Can you please\r\nstop posting about dating, it’s secondhand embarrassment? Your dick-to-ride-on\r\nis not special at all, seriously.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Iasked around in Seoul about where I might encounter\r\nchildren in the wild, and was directed to Daechi-dong, an affluent neighborhood\r\nnotorious for its gated high-rise fortresses, luxury S.U.V.s, and after-school\r\nacademies, or <i>hagwons</i>. These institutions have names such as\r\nGroton, Swaton International, and Emilton Academy, and each has its own faux\r\nheraldry. The most privileged students spend their afternoons, evenings, and\r\nweekends at as many as a dozen different <i>hagwons</i>. Eighty per cent\r\nof Korean families purchase private education; poor families tend to spend as\r\nmuch on <i>hagwons</i> as on groceries. Aggregate spending on\r\neducational enrichment exceeds the R. &amp; D. expenditures of Samsung, a\r\nconglomerate that makes up a fifth of the entire Korean economy. At school\r\ndismissal, students climb into yellow buses that ferry them from one <i>hagwon</i> to\r\nthe next. Through the plate-glass window of a building stacked with <i>hagwons</i>,\r\nI could see an orderly queue of elementary schoolers—so colorful, so\r\nsmall—awaiting their turn in the elevator.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Koreans cite the pressures and costs of excessive education\r\nas a large part of their reluctance to have children. (American parents in\r\nliberal enclaves might share a version of these misgivings.) An auspicious\r\nKorean childhood culminates in acceptance to one of Seoul’s three most\r\nprestigious universities. Admission is primarily based on a student’s\r\nperformance on the national collegiate entrance exam, or Suneung, which is\r\nadministered every year on a Thursday in November. The opening of the stock\r\nmarket is delayed that day, and many construction sites are closed. Bus and\r\nmetro services are increased to ease traffic congestion. Students running late\r\nmay avail themselves of a police-motorcycle escort. During the\r\nEnglish-comprehension section, which requires absolute silence, air-traffic\r\ncontrol suspends all takeoffs and landings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>At some <i>hagwons</i>, fifth graders learn calculus.\r\nElementary students take pre-med courses. Some focus on sports or musical\r\ninstruments. There’s a Korean saying that “a dragon emerges from a small\r\nstream”—that talent can be identified and nurtured in any backwater. But the\r\npolitical analyst John Lee, who was once a <i>hagwon</i> instructor,\r\nwas dubious about this meritocratic ideal: “I was given a score range for\r\nstudents. If I gave a score that was too high, the parents would think that\r\ntheir children should be at a ‘better’ <i>hagwon</i>. If I gave a score\r\nthat was too low, the parents would think, This is wasting my money, it’s not\r\nworking.” Some <i>hagwons</i> are extremely selective. As one young\r\nwoman said, “If you don’t go to a certain one, you’re not part of the group.”\r\nHistorically, at the strictest cram schools, social interactions were carefully\r\ncircumscribed. Some forbade any conversation between boys and girls that were\r\nnot directly related to study. Hugging, or the exchange of romantic notes,\r\nmight have resulted in bathroom-cleaning duty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Four out of five children in Korea today describe school as\r\na “battlefield.” In 2012, the advocacy group World Without Worries About\r\nPrivate Education helped develop an ad campaign that showed a baby bottle full\r\nof fried rice, with a caption that read, “Mom! It’s too early for me.” Curfew\r\nlaws prohibit <i>hagwon</i> classes after about 10 or 11 <span>p.m</span>. The issue nonetheless remains a\r\nsociety-wide prisoner’s dilemma, and even those who strenuously object in\r\nprinciple frequently relent in practice. When I visited the advocacy group, one\r\nemployee told me, “In the macro, everyone understands it’s a problem, but in\r\nthe micro, for <i>my</i> family, and <i>my</i> kids, I have\r\nto do it.” When I commented that the children must be miserable, he corrected\r\nme: “If you don’t send them, the kids feel bad! That’s the only place they can\r\nsee their friends, because no one is at the playground.” The leading cause of death\r\namong young Koreans is suicide. More than one Korean described their culture to\r\nme as “broken.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>It is\r\nnot easy to opt out of the system. One morning, I met with half a dozen members\r\nof an unorthodox day-care collective in a neighborhood called Hapjeong. This\r\npatch of Seoul, they told me, was distinctive for its lack of chain stores, and\r\nthey convened at an otherwise empty local bakery; it was next to a Starbucks,\r\nacross the street from two other Starbucks, and catty-corner from a fourth\r\nStarbucks. Forty years ago, Seoul had practically no child care. Some working\r\nparents locked their children in their apartments and hoped for the best.\r\nChildren died in house fires. In 2002, a group of grassroots organizers formed\r\nthis communal alternative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The current parents were nostalgic for their own alleyway\r\nchildhoods. An artist named Daum told me that, when he was young, “if you\r\nkicked a ball into someone else’s property, you went and rang the doorbell and\r\ngot it back.” That city no longer existed: “Now you get yelled at—‘You could’ve\r\nbroken my window!’ ” There’s a special word for noise between floors.\r\nComplaints forced Daum and his wife, Dani, to leave their previous building;\r\none neighbor said, “I can’t stand your children anymore!”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The day care took the kids outside every day. They learned\r\nabout plants and animals, and were taught to mark the seasons with the old\r\nfestival days. The use of standard honorifics was discouraged, and children\r\nspoke to teachers in “half speak,” the register ordinarily reserved for\r\ninformal address. The parents agreed not to send their children to <i>hagwons</i> for\r\nthe time being. This ethic of mutual care had made parenting “less scary,” one\r\nmother remarked. Still, when their children aged out, they would be fed to the\r\neducational machine. Another mother said, “When they get to normal elementary\r\nschool, the other little kids are already accustomed to a full-day\r\nschedule—they have more stamina, they’re used to <i>hagwons</i>—but these\r\nkids are still used to nap time.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Hwang Ock-kyeung, the president of a government-sponsored\r\nthink tank, told me that changes in policy can’t mend a culture that\r\nmarginalizes children. “My own employees tell me their babies look alien to\r\nthem,” she said. “Young people want the government to increase the child-care\r\nhours, but then the time people spend with their children decreases!” An\r\nobsession with social status turns children into tokens of parental\r\nachievement: “Many parents take the subsidies and spend more money on\r\nextra <i>hagwons</i>, and that becomes a vicious cycle.” Enhanced\r\nprofessional productivity for parents, and the ability to enjoy one’s free\r\ntime, were not just collateral benefits. She added, “There’s a reason that if\r\nyou go to Daechi-dong you’ll see <i>hagwons</i> and Pilates in the\r\nsame building.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Just before Christmas, when a viral tweet announced a\r\nrecord low for American fertility, some liberals blew confetti. One young woman\r\nwas retweeted twenty-six thousand times for writing, “Amazing keep it up\r\neverybody!!!!!!” A comedian urged her followers to “<span>HOLD THE LINE</span>!!!!!” Last year, the philosopher Anastasia\r\nBerg and the editor Rachel Wiseman, who seem otherwise unimpeachably\r\nprogressive, published a book called “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhat-Are-Children-Ambivalence-Choice%2Fdp%2F1250276136%2Fref%3Dtmm_hrd_swatch_0%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26dib_tag%3Dse%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qEfy7_uMyLICL7RkL8CqSc4hW5OmTJxe6mNgh6FtdfUWM_yT2Fev6wb2fD_5SbqiXQJKE5pFKiSmeoTwOV0E_lqU5aKwHYOOUDDY9viHNjICxQl561plT8X2CZtjjl3hL85c6859-SZjmPPf5kKL5zQK06oy43yYX74N5_QDiiToUAZ8Sm_IofmmOX5oYo7pB7SwJGZ47rPWJsuekvwCPk_VwFRizEB_4QxckgK3ZqA.vRuYpfyM6gRGU2DW9vbFD8k4vvEvqLZgmglVy5bu3_Q%26qid%3D1740175308%26sr%3D8-1\"><span>What Are Children For?</span></a>”\r\nIt builds to a thoughtful, nuanced, heavily qualified endorsement of\r\nchildbearing as kinda nice. In a scathing review, the writer Moira Donegan\r\nobserved that ambivalent American women do not lack for such counsel. Any\r\nleftist who feels the need to emphasize that babies are good, Donegan argues,\r\nmight not be a leftist after all: “It may be that on some level, perhaps not\r\nalways a conscious one, the millennial pro-natalists are trying to convince\r\nAmerican women that the freedom they lost with Roe v. Wade was not worth\r\nhaving.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Given the stakes for reproductive autonomy, Donegan’s\r\nreservations are entirely comprehensible. Most left-leaning Americans are\r\nsimilarly distrustful of the pro-natalist discourse. Leigh Senderowicz, a\r\nfeminist demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told me, “There is\r\nfundamentally no way to do this that doesn’t end up treating women’s bodies as\r\na tool.” According to the U.N., countries with pro-natalist policies tend to be\r\nless democratic. A baby-bonus initiative in Italy’s Piedmont region was given a\r\nname and logo that seemed an awful lot like an homage to Fascism. Eberstadt,\r\nthe economist, told me, “In China, the mechanics are in place to say, ‘Oh, I’m\r\nsorry, Miss Wong, you can’t fly on airplanes anymore, because you’re\r\nunmarried.’ ” Local Party officials are already knocking on doors to track\r\nmenstrual cycles. The Russian government recently passed a law that\r\ncriminalizes “child-free propaganda,” potentially including the representation\r\nof a happily childless couple on television or social media.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Some progressives seem fine with child-free propaganda. The\r\nBirthStrike Movement proclaims that “not having children is the single most\r\nimpactful decision that a person can make to reverse climate change.” This\r\nmight seem sensible, but depopulation will happen far too slowly to alleviate\r\nthe worst effects of climate change. The children who would have traded their\r\nown existence for a cooler planet have already been born. In “What Are Children\r\nFor?,” <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Ffault-lines%2Fhow-liberals-talk-about-children\"><span>Berg and Wiseman</span></a> suggest\r\nthat such environmental logic provides a cloak of moral legitimacy for personal\r\npreferences that feel otherwise difficult to articulate. One scholar called\r\nthis the “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F09644016.2021.1902700\"><span>socio-political weaponization of\r\nfertility</span></a>.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Liberals are right to point to immigration as the obvious\r\nway to mitigate the economic effects of demographic contraction. Italy\r\ncurrently has a shortage of nurses, and Germany has a shortage of plumbers; a\r\nbaby born today does nothing to unclog a Düsseldorf sink. Even immigration,\r\nhowever, is a stopgap measure: by 2100, ninety-seven per cent of the world’s\r\ncountries are predicted to be below replacement. In the meantime,\r\npro-immigration policies will continue to generate nativist backlashes. Last\r\nyear, Seoul sponsored a pilot program to import a hundred nannies from the\r\nPhilippines. The project, despite its lack of ambition, was wildly\r\ncontroversial. This was perhaps unsurprising: Korean women have been known to\r\nberate their Vietnamese daughters-in-law for peeling apples in the wrong\r\ndirection. American liberals are quick to associate the fear of cultural\r\ncorrosion with xenophobia. But Korea was long a vassal state of China, and then\r\na Japanese colony, so the question of civilizational survival has a slightly\r\ndifferent valence there than it does here. And even liberals tend to get\r\nunderstandably sentimental about, say, the loss of linguistic diversity. The\r\nFinnish demographer Anna Rotkirch pointed out to me that fewer than ten\r\nthousand babies were born in Estonia last year. “What will happen to the\r\nEstonian language?” she asked. “Seriously, this is not a far-off thing!”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><span>“My productivity apps weren’t working, so I hired a goon.”</span></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cartoon\r\nby Emily Flake</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Link copied</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shop</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The most sophisticated liberal arguments interpret\r\nfertility decline as a symptom of more serious underlying problems—economic\r\nprecarity and an “incomplete” gender revolution. Men and women alike struggle\r\nto provide for their families, but the participation of fathers at home has not\r\ncaught up to the participation of mothers at work. A more generous welfare\r\nstate, and a more equitable culture, should therefore produce more children.\r\nThis does not seem to be the case. Finland famously provides all new parents\r\nwith “baby boxes” full of useful, high-quality products, and Sweden has normalized\r\nextended parental leave, especially for fathers, and flexible work hours. The\r\nNordic countries are wonderful places to be parents, but their fertility rates\r\nare lower than our own. These trends are not reducible to budgetary concerns.\r\nChild care is virtually free in Vienna and extremely expensive in Zurich, but\r\nthe Austrians and the Swiss have the same fertility rate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The incidence of childlessness among Democrats is\r\nsignificantly higher than it is among Republicans. This appears in part to be\r\nan artifact of educational polarization. Lower fertility rates seem correlated\r\nwith the perception that proper child development depends upon enormous amounts\r\nof personal attention. Some economists attribute our recent fertility slide to\r\na generational shift: people who were born in the nineties are less likely to\r\nremember a time when children were largely left alone. Working mothers today\r\ndevote more time to active child care than stay-at-home mothers did in previous\r\ngenerations. Mothers with a college degree spend about four more hours per week\r\nwith their children than mothers without one, and they are also less likely to\r\nlive in proximity to extended family. In an economy biased in favor of highly\r\nskilled employees, a protracted education followed by a long career\r\napprenticeship seems like the only way to secure a dependable income. But the\r\nlonger people wait to try to form a family, the less likely they are to have\r\none.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>We all\r\nmight agree that everyone deserves the financial security to afford the number\r\nof children they desire. The word “afford,” however, means different things to\r\ndifferent people, and in the coastal precincts of “achievement culture” it has\r\nbeen inflated to encompass individual bedrooms, piano lessons, travel lacrosse\r\nteams, Russian math, and single-origin organic peanut butter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>For most of human history, having children was something\r\nthe majority of people simply did without thinking too much about it. Now it is\r\none competing alternative among many. The only overarching explanation for the\r\nglobal fertility decline is that once childbearing is no longer seen as\r\nsomething special—as an obligation to God, to one’s ancestors, or to the\r\nfuture—people will do less of it. It is misogynistic to equate reproductive\r\nautonomy with self-indulgence, and child-free people often devote themselves to\r\nloving, conscientious caretaking. At the same time, we should be able to\r\nacknowledge that there is something slightly discomforting about a world view\r\nthat weighs children against expensive dinners or vacations to Venice—as\r\nmatters of mere preference in a logic of consumption.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In the southern city of Gangjin, I stopped at a coffee shop\r\nand encountered a sign on the entrance that read “This is a no-kids zone. The\r\nchild is not at fault. The problem is the parents who do not take care of the\r\nchild.” The doors of Korean establishments are frequently emblazoned with such\r\nprohibitions. The only children I saw on Seoul’s public transit were\r\nforeigners. Kim Kyu-jin, who is by all accounts part of Korea’s first openly\r\nlesbian couple with a child, told me, “Five years ago, we didn’t think too\r\ndeeply about ‘no-kids zones.’ Now we think it’s discriminatory. We always call\r\nplaces beforehand to ask if we can bring our daughter.” Children remain welcome\r\nand visible at malls. The Seoul government offers a “Multi-Child Happiness\r\nCard,” which gives parents discounts at select amusement parks and theatres.\r\nWhen it was first introduced, you needed three kids to qualify; now you qualify\r\nwith two. Daum, the artist, told me, “We joke that soon enough they’re going to\r\ngive the ‘multiple-kids card’ to households with only one.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>It is a poignant irony that among Korea’s few\r\nchild-friendly places are former schools. In a picturesque river valley outside\r\nthe northern city of Chuncheon, an old elementary school has been converted\r\ninto a café and resort that resembles a high-end sanatorium, with blond wood\r\nand poured concrete. Alongside nostalgic references to the “innocent smiles of\r\nchildren long ago,” its brochure offers a family photo-shoot package; the price\r\nincludes basic retouching, although they promise not to “go overboard.” For\r\nfamilies who can’t afford premium coffees, the Seoul government has repurposed\r\na collection of rural schools as family campgrounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>One lies in the mountains not far from the D.M.Z.; I\r\nvisited at the tail end of foliage season. An uneven parking lot had been\r\noutfitted with a matrix of black tents erected atop low wooden platforms. The\r\nold cafeteria featured a few game tables. A pink-sweatsuited adolescent played\r\na desultory Ping-Pong match against his uncle. The boy’s father told me, “We\r\ncome here with our children so we won’t be bothered by other people’s\r\njudgment.” Outside, dry brown leaves blew around in a light rain, and most of\r\nthe families huddled under awnings that had been installed to protect the\r\ntents. One solitary little girl played with a bright bird-shaped kite attached\r\nto a plastic fishing pole. As I left, I noticed a statue of a boy with a torch,\r\nidentical to the one I’d seen at the school in Haenem, but considerably the\r\nworse for wear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Countries have tried everything to reverse demographic\r\ncollapse. In Hungary, women with four or more children gain a lifetime\r\nexemption from income tax. In Georgia, the Orthodox Patriarch offered to\r\npersonally baptize any baby born to the parents of more than two children.\r\nAlthough some nations have stabilized at a low level, there is not a single\r\nmodern example of one that has managed a sustained recovery from very low\r\nfertility to replacement. The world’s most lavishly pro-natalist governments\r\nspend a fortune on incentives and services, and have increased the fertility\r\nrate by approximately a fifth of a baby per woman. Some observers believe that\r\nsubsidies could succeed, but they would have to be on the order of three\r\nhundred thousand dollars per child.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>One smoggy morning, I visited Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of\r\nSeoul, at his City Hall office, which recalled the captain’s deck in a space\r\nopera. He has focussed primarily on the dire shortage of housing in Seoul, a\r\ncity where almost fifty per cent of people now live alone. He listed his other\r\ninitiatives: the Childbirth Encouragement Project, which included “eighty-seven\r\nsubprojects,” and the Mom and Dad Happiness Project, which comprised\r\n“twenty-eight subprojects.” While the Mayor lectured me, a large screen on the\r\nfar wall ticked through an optimistic slide show of inverted pyramids and other\r\nfanciful renderings of urban futurism. When I mentioned that some demographers\r\nnow regard population decline as a phenomenon to be managed rather than\r\nremediated, he intimated that voters were an obstacle to more profound\r\nadjustments. On my way out, two of his aides directed my attention to a lobby\r\ncafé where espresso drinks were prepared by a robotic barista arm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Some Korean companies pay their employees to have children,\r\nbut the private sector now generally accepts that it must adapt to a world\r\nwhere children are luxuries. Analysts anticipate a\r\nhundred-and-sixty-billion-dollar “silver industry” to meet the needs of healthy\r\npensioners. One travel agency expects that seniors, in the absence of\r\ngrandchildren to spoil, will spend their disposable income on pricier trips.\r\nConglomerates like Hyundai are planning high-end retirement communities for\r\nthose who cannot rely on their families for eldercare. Companies that once\r\ncatered to the mass market will have to pivot to a premium clientele. Samsung\r\nhas long relied on wedding registries for the sales of large appliances. Cho,\r\nthe celebrity demographer, praised a recent company plan to sell a few really\r\nfancy refrigerators in place of many adequate ones. The new line is called\r\nSamsung Bespoke.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The United States is nowhere near the point of robotic\r\nbaristas. The current “crisis” might well go the way of the population bomb.\r\nThe sociologist Philip N. Cohen told me, “If you think you have a model\r\nnow that predicts birth rates in two hundred years, you’re just drawing lines\r\non a chart.” Most scholars deem our nascent panic to be counterproductive; in\r\nthe reassuringly titled “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDecline-Prosper-Changing-Advantages-Children%2Fdp%2F3030916103%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3D1DC03R2NSJ2OA%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0Kgm50zNbwHUBFSU9ENWA2pJfWn2St5fa8azaDcKSlt1auOchKmWfZm6r09xmJZ3.PHHKpcgT7cDScEYzy_T0JKv5VWzGfX0EuMLM8uYEUGM%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3DDecline%2520and%2520Prosper%26qid%3D1740175521%26sprefix%3D%2Caps%2C198%26sr%3D8-1\"><span>Decline and Prosper!</span></a>,”\r\nfrom 2022, the Norwegian demographer Vegard Skirbekk reiterates that “low, but\r\nnot too low,” fertility is a good thing. There is, however, an asterisk\r\nattached to this. Two decades ago, Skirbekk helped contrive a thought\r\nexperiment called “the low-fertility trap hypothesis,” which proposed the\r\npossibility of an unrecoverable downward spiral. Ultra-low fertility meant far\r\nfewer babies, which meant far fewer people to have babies, or even to <i>know</i> babies;\r\nthis feedback loop could even shift cultural norms so far that childlessness\r\nwould become the default option.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>This eventuality had seemed remote. Then it more or less\r\nhappened in Korea. When I asked Skirbekk if other countries might follow suit,\r\nhe replied, “Quite a few, possibly.” Rotkirch, the Finnish demographer,\r\nunderscored the notion that reproductive cues are social. “In a forthcoming\r\nsurvey, I want to ask, ‘Have you ever had a baby in your arms?’ ” she told\r\nme. “I think in Finland it’s a sizable portion that hasn’t.” These mimetic\r\ndynamics play out not just within countries but between them. Hwang Sun-jae, a\r\nsociologist who studies fertility norms, traces the swift dissemination of low\r\nfertility in part to social media’s role as an accelerant of global\r\nmonoculture. It has never been easier to acquaint yourself with the opportunity\r\ncosts of childbearing—the glamorous destinations unvisited, the faddish foods\r\nuneaten. “People once had only local comparisons,” he said. “Now they see other\r\npeople’s lives—in New York City and England and France—and they have a sense of\r\nrelative deprivation: my life is not good enough.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The costs of an aging and diminished society feel more\r\nabstract. Last year, an online sketch portrayed a traditional Korean\r\nfirst-birthday celebration in ten years’ time: the <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2022%2F12%2F12%2Fat-qatars-world-cup-where-politics-and-pleasure-collide\"><span>World Cup</span></a> stadium\r\nhosts the festivities for a crowd of ten thousand, including the country’s\r\nPresident. Regular life, in the video, is peppered with minor inconveniences:\r\nfood orders can take more than ninety minutes. The actual inconveniences might\r\nnot be as minor. By 2050, Korea’s labor force will be about two-thirds of its\r\ncurrent size, and food delivery might be a thing of the past. Cho advised the\r\nNongshim noodle company that it would soon be impossible to hire anyone in\r\nBusan, Korea’s second-largest city.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Retirement ages will continue to increase. Autocratic\r\ncountries, where politicians can ignore older voters, might simply deny\r\npensions to the childless. New forms of factionalism could test the limits of\r\nliberal coexistence. Younger workers in social democracies might increasingly\r\nresent the taxes they pay for entitlement programs that they will never\r\nthemselves receive. Men, especially those of low status, are currently much\r\nless likely to have the number of children they desire, if they have children at\r\nall. If this trend continues, every election will be an incel election. In “<a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChildren-Men-JAMES-P-D%2Fdp%2F0571342213%2Fref%3Dtmm_pap_swatch_0%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26dib_tag%3Dse%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wlbKNIaEGNomVxoUtnfYEhXiNLp7loivhF10j7DfYWHw5ePomGuA0c0SlgEQmrDDzb1bppmjQqDDfCh6WK8mHMnBF84vL4cMalyhjnVIVwvdyLpU0W1fUr49mflqTZ5Vf9GWKFs6knHedNquY6vbJktlQfvU4ZQKclSC7m39WXyLnrOdlqKWGhvb1ozNg_dSa70n35znjDnjswqUazcV2mkj6MN4X_23svY9k7KtxIA.g560USPfZ72wMx2_ZbeLpmy6oIhr0UCrvroKUVmnIO4%26qid%3D1740175571%26sr%3D8-1\"><span>The Children of Men</span></a>,” not\r\nthe film but the original novel, by P. D. James, the social order cannot\r\nwithstand such a void. Great Britain is an island of twilit senility overseen\r\nby a strict Warden. Basic infrastructure is shored up by an immigrant\r\nunderclass, and the elderly are chained to barges that disappear beneath the\r\nsea. (A few years ago, Yusuke Narita, a Japanese economist at Yale, called upon\r\nJapanese seniors to perform seppuku.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Many Koreans told me that they look forward to a society\r\nwith less competition—a smaller, gentler world with a greater share of\r\nresources for all. In this picture, the future is exactly the same as the\r\npresent, except with fewer people. It is just as probable, however, that\r\ninequality will increase. As universities close en masse, the remainder might\r\nprove even more selective. If Korea’s labor force becomes insufficient to\r\nproduce and distribute basic goods—a distinct possibility by the end of the\r\ncentury—they could be hoarded by those of means. The demographer Dean Spears\r\nnoted that the more idiosyncratic our needs and desires the more we rely on the\r\nfact that other people share them: “If you need specialized medical care,\r\nyou’re less likely to find it in a rural place than in a big city, where there\r\nare more people who need the same sort of thing you need.” If current trends\r\ncontinue, in several decades there will be many fewer Koreans, and virtually\r\nall of them will live in metropolitan Seoul—a city-state surrounded by\r\nwilderness, ruin, and, if they are lucky, robotic rice cultivation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Economic prosperity has long relied on an expanding\r\npopulation to drive greater output, increased demand, and new markets.\r\nAdvocates of degrowth have pointed out the manifest unsustainability of such\r\nintergenerational pyramid schemes, but their implosion will probably not be\r\npeaceful. If the bottom falls out of, say, the Chinese real-estate market—among\r\nthe largest asset classes in the world—the entire global economy could totter.\r\nIroquois “mourning wars” against neighboring tribes—raids to replenish their own\r\nnumbers with captives—intensified in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nafter disease and colonial violence depleted the nation. Russia’s invasion of\r\nUkraine seems to have been motivated in part by Vladimir Putin’s desire to\r\nincrease the motherland’s quantity of ethnic Russians.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In a\r\ngrotesque way, the “Mad Max” scenario represents a comforting fantasy. A\r\nsteampunk world—with war-making vehicles lashed together from old radiators and\r\nAtari circuit boards—is at least a vital one. But a depopulated landscape might\r\nactually be characterized by quiescence. There is an extensive literature that\r\nlinks economic dynamism to youth. Young people, who have wilder imaginations\r\nand a greater appetite for risk, drive the bulk of entrepreneurial activity.\r\nFor <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Felon-musk\"><span>Elon Musk</span></a> and his\r\nfollowers, children are technological lottery tickets: we never know which\r\ngenetically enhanced baby might at last invent a functional warp drive. One\r\ntechnological pro-natalist told me, “We do not exist just to consume, and we\r\ndon’t want the end state of humanity to be the Villages in Florida.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The most persuasive aspect of technological pro-natalism is\r\nnot what we might theoretically gain from a larger population. It is the\r\nforeboding of what we might lose with a diminished one. The evolutionary\r\nanthropologist Joseph Henrich has summoned the example of the aboriginal\r\nTasmanians, who were cut off from mainland Australia about ten thousand years\r\nago. Their population was too small and too diffuse to preserve their\r\nexpertise, and they apparently forgot how to make complex bone tools, how to\r\nmake warm clothing, and even how to fish. And sheer numbers are only part of\r\nthe story. For a culture to evolve, it needs a lot of different kinds of\r\npeople—stubborn, nutty people with outlandish proposals. The weirdest people\r\naround are almost always children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Demographers often worry that indulging in sci-fi\r\nspeculation might inadvertently prompt governments to adopt draconian measures.\r\nStill, the demographer Leslie Root admitted that she sometimes wonders, “Is it\r\npossible we actually evolved to be too smart for our own good, and we’re just\r\ntoo interested in other things to go along with the bullshit of having to have\r\nenough kids to perpetuate the species? I don’t know! Maybe?” She collected\r\nherself, then added, “What’s most interesting to me, when I think about what it\r\nmight be like to maintain a stable human population, is that there’s a very\r\nreal possibility that we’ll need to reinvent society.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Adecade ago, a Korean reality program showcased wealthy\r\ncelebrities in unattainably idyllic scenes with their children. A more\r\nrealistic portrayal of family life might have been more fruitful. Miji and\r\nHo-gil are a shy, attractive, and slightly unusual couple, the parents of two\r\nboys. Miji, who is thirty-three, studied media in Seoul, and then freelanced\r\nfor a broadcaster in Gwangju. Ho-gil, who is thirty-eight, got a job after\r\ncollege at a children’s foundation, where the “strict milestones” that govern\r\nKorean aspirations lost their hold on him. He recently saw a report that Korea\r\nwas the only wealthy industrialized nation where the highest personal priority\r\nwas economic improvement rather than love. He told me, “In Korean society, we\r\nare educated to have one single goal, but then, once you’re grown up, you don’t\r\nknow what to do with your freedom—you get lost in the world, and you don’t know\r\nhow to have a good life.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>They met at a book club in 2016. Miji matter-of-factly\r\ncharacterized herself as “the kind of person who is always swayed by other\r\npeople’s opinions,” and she was drawn to Ho-gil for his independence. After\r\nfive years of living separately, they decided to get married. She wanted a\r\nlarge, formal wedding, but he imagined something more intimate, and they\r\ncompromised. Miji told me, “I can’t ignore social norms, but I have to strike a\r\nbalance between what society wants and his beliefs.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><span>“You know how sometimes you say you’re not hungry, but then\r\nyou see what I’m eating and ask for a bite, and I always let you and I’m never\r\nannoyed?”</span></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cartoon\r\nby Suerynn Lee</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Copy link to cartoon</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Link copied</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Shop</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>She hoped to have children, but at the time he felt\r\n“selfish”—he wasn’t used to being around kids and wasn’t sure what to do with\r\nthem. He read some books about children, and they had a “very intense debate\r\nand discussion.” She had no job security, and he told her, “If you’re serious\r\nabout this, change your job fast.” She found a position as a museum curator.\r\nHo-gil told me that he “isn’t interested in moving up the ladder,” so he wasn’t\r\nworried that he’d be penalized for taking time off. But Miji seemed more\r\nambivalent: “If you have career ambitions, it’s really hard to make the\r\ndecision to go on leave for children.” (She noted that she has been passed over\r\ntwice for a promotion.) At the time, Gwangju offered a monthly payment to\r\nparents of about a hundred and fifty dollars, on top of a five-hundred-dollar\r\nsubsidy that the federal government paid each month until the child went to day\r\ncare. For Ho-gil, the money made the prospect thinkable. “All his decisions\r\nwere down to the numbers, and the numbers worked out,” Miji said.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Their first child, Wooju, was born in 2022. When they\r\nbrought him home from the hospital, the first thing they did was apologize to\r\ntheir neighbors, warning them that they “might move around and make noise.”\r\nFortunately, the elderly couple downstairs was “more forgiving than most.” Miji\r\nand Ho-gil were very happy. It was easy to imagine having a second.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Regional birth subsidies sometimes succeed on paper, but\r\nthese statistics are artificially inflated by “take and dash” parents, who move\r\nto a place temporarily for the money—as if the entire country were playing a\r\nbizarro version of musical chairs. In 2023, Gwangju curtailed the subsidies.\r\nBut, just as Miji became pregnant again, Gangjin, a small city about an hour\r\nand a half away, announced an offer three times as generous. As it happened,\r\nHo-gil’s parents worked a farm there. Much of what Miji knew about the area was\r\ngleaned from a reality-television show about the renovation of ghost-town\r\nhouses; her friends found the prospect of their moving to Gangjin inexplicable,\r\neven shameful. Still, this past October, the family relocated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>On a weekday morning, they had me over to their tidy, spare\r\napartment. One of the only adornments on the walls was a long-defunct\r\nvideo-intercom console, its molded curves like a “Star Trek” fossil. The meagre\r\ntrappings seemed like a defiant statement of their priorities, and the home was\r\nwarmed by their togetherness. Their younger son, ten-month-old Eun-byul, was a\r\nround child dressed in a green bib that made him look like a little flower. He\r\nhad only just begun to say “Mommy.” They were impressed by how dissimilar the\r\ntwo boys were—the older one sensitive and introverted, the little one active\r\nand outgoing. Their lives are largely isolated. They’re grateful for the\r\nregion’s rural beauty, but the closest pediatrician is about a twenty-minute\r\ndrive away. Miji said, “If your baby isn’t healthy, you can’t live here.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>They had noticed one neighbor with a baby, and they were\r\nhoping that at some point they’d say more than “hello.” They have otherwise\r\nresigned themselves to the fact that they’ll have few opportunities to meet\r\nother parents until school begins, when they’ll join a parent group chat for\r\nlogistics. The town features three places they can take the kids, including an\r\nindoor playground run by the local district office. They showed me photos of\r\nEun-byul in a little sandbox on a linoleum floor. The town’s one “trendy\r\nInstagrammable café,” as Miji put it, has declared itself a no-kids zone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>They seemed pleased for the chance to discuss the\r\nbanalities of rural family life. Miji’s friends weren’t interested in hearing\r\nabout it. They told her, “Once the children are older, you’ll come back to\r\nGwangju for their education.” She’d attended a <i>hagwon</i> to\r\nprepare for the college entrance exam, and she wasn’t inclined to deny her\r\nchildren the same advantage. Ho-gil had not, and he didn’t think it was\r\nnecessary. In fact, he wasn’t convinced that a college degree was essential,\r\nwhich to most Koreans is as radical as saying that he didn’t need hot water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When they do return to their jobs, they will both face an\r\nhour-and-a-half-long commute each direction. They consider that a concern for\r\nanother day. Ho-gil picked up Eun-byul, who bounced on his lap with a contented\r\nsigh. He said, “Of course I have doubts, and I wonder what my life would have\r\nbeen like if I hadn’t chosen to have a family.” But he’d been wrong to assume,\r\nas his friends did, that “fatherhood eats away at your personal life.” Still,\r\nmy (male, unmarried, dog-owning) interpreter, who told me later that such\r\naffectionate behavior was uncommon among Korean fathers, couldn’t help but ask\r\nhim, “Aren’t you bored?”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>There’s a philosophical view, best associated with the\r\nscholar L. A. Paul, that the decision to have children is fundamentally\r\nirrational. A rigorous cost-benefit analysis might produce an estimate of a\r\nchild’s expected value, but the experience is transformative in a way that\r\nrenders the calculation irrelevant. You will have made a decision by the lights\r\nof a person you will no longer be. There’s something inescapably patronizing\r\nwhen parents make this argument. I remain unsure if it’s true, yet I’ve heard\r\nmyself repeat it. For the usual reasons of work-life intractability, writing\r\nthis piece has taken me away from my own little boys. When I asked my\r\neight-year-old why someone should have children, he stopped punching his little\r\nbrother long enough to say, “We’re excellent company.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The leap-of-faith argument makes sense only if we, and the\r\nsociety we live in, remain open to such transformation. In Korea, one graduate\r\nstudent told me, “The standard life course is boring. Surprises are not\r\nvirtues. We can imagine all of the things until we die.” Before the Asian\r\nfinancial crisis, in 1997, the economist Kim Seongeun told me, the top scorers\r\non the collegiate entrance exam often went on to Seoul National University to\r\nstudy physics. When a faltering economy prompted large companies to fire their\r\nscientists, he observed, many parents converged on the idea that medicine was a\r\nsafer path. It didn’t take long for the top scorers to become doctors instead.\r\nKim wasn’t exempt from the tendency to hedge his bets: “How can I place my own\r\nson in a small boat?” To become a parent at all, I remarked offhandedly, was to\r\nperceive all boats as too small. He laughed and thought for a moment, then\r\nsaid, “Maybe the low fertility rate here is because people are smart. The\r\nrisk-free asset in a diversified portfolio is zero kid.” He just wasn’t sure\r\nwhat to make of it all in the end. He said, “The low fertility rate is not\r\nreally good or bad. We just don’t know.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>This is the intellectually responsible position.\r\nEmotionally, it’s a little evasive. Rotkirch, the Finnish demographer, recalled\r\na newspaper item in which a young woman asked why she should sacrifice her body\r\nand her partnership for a pregnancy. Such anxieties are a natural prelude to\r\nany vault into the unknown. Still, Rotkirch marvelled, “My idea was that it\r\njust happens and it’s normal to be nervous.” Chang Pilwha, who has been an\r\ninfluential women’s-studies scholar for forty years, echoed this bewilderment.\r\n“Many of my best feminist friends say the best thing they’ve ever done is have\r\na child, and nobody should brand that as conservative or liberal,” she said.\r\nShe is apprehensive about what society will look like once fewer and fewer\r\npeople are parents. As she put it, “Becoming a mother or a father is a precious\r\nprocess of learning to be human, and the lack of that experience with\r\nvulnerability is only going to create more ruthlessness.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Child\r\nrearing is not a necessary condition for vulnerability. It’s not even a\r\nsufficient one. But there may nevertheless be something irreducible about the\r\nshared experience of parenthood—a life in which your fragile heart now seems to\r\nbeat on the outside of your body. You see the guardians of a sleeping child on\r\nthe subway and think, These are not just random strangers but fellow-passengers\r\nwith utterly exasperating human beings for whom they would unequivocally die.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Children have long played a symbolic role in a debate that\r\nwas carried out far over their actual heads. For everyone who saw them as the\r\nultimate affirmation of life itself, someone else saw our treatment of them as\r\nreason to despair. The poet <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2004%2F07%2F26%2Ftwice-collected\"><span>Philip Larkin</span></a> wrote,\r\n“Man hands on misery to man. / It deepens like a coastal\r\nshelf. / Get out as early as you can, / And don’t have any\r\nkids yourself.” It didn’t much matter. Most people went ahead and had them\r\nanyway.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>It seems as if we might now be transforming an old and\r\ninsoluble philosophical conflict into an empirical experiment with real stakes.\r\nSometimes it seems as though we’re in a hurry to do so. The fertility-rate\r\nculture war wields children as symbolic extensions of ourselves. People look to\r\nthe birth rate as an index of what is normal, and no one is safe from the dread\r\nof judgment. Conservatives with large families fear they are seen as zoo\r\nanimals. Liberals without children fear they are seen as selfish careerists or\r\nlibertines. This may not just be a consequence of the fertility decline; it\r\nmight be intensifying it. Children could survive being yoked to the value of\r\nhumanity as a whole. It feels much more perilous to treat them as instruments\r\nof our own identities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Children are variables in our lives. But they are also\r\nstrange birds of their own. Religious people talk about them as carriers of the\r\ndivine spark, technologists as messengers from the future. Secular humanists\r\nare content to mumble something about the imagination. In any case, they should\r\nprobably be prevented from sticking their fingers into sockets or setting fire\r\nto our homes. But we might otherwise trust them to figure out what they mean,\r\nor how to mean it. We might stand before them as models of humility and\r\nambivalence. It is not fair for us, as individual parents or as a society, to\r\nexpect them to bear the weight of our certainties. They are, after all, just\r\nchildren. ♦</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Published\r\nin the print edition of the <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2025%2F03%2F03\"><span>March 3, 2025</span></a>, issue,\r\nwith the headline “The End of Children.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p></div>",

Solar led the charge, growing 27% year-over-year, and even outpaced natural gas in meeting new demand. The US installed over 50 gigawatts of solar in 2024, with Texas and California leading the way. This solar buildout was largely made possible by the plummeting costs of solar panels over the last decade, with costs down nearly 90%. </p><p>Replacing coal with renewables is an undeniable good. Coal is a highly pollutive and emits massive amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. It’s also dangerous to mine and can pollute the environment around the mines. Coal is no bueno, especially when compared to the other energy sources at our disposal. </p><p>More energy is good. The more of it that’s clean and cheap, the better. For the US and the world to progress, the goal isn’t just reducing coal consumption. It’s generating abundant, cheap and relatively clean energy with lots and lots of solar, wind, nuclear, and, at least for the time being, oil and LNG. </p><p><em>Kevin Crowley and Ruth Liao for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The US, which in the span of about seven years transformed itself from an irrelevant supplier of LNG into the world’s largest, is set to expand its production capacity by 60% in the first half of Donald Trump’s second presidency, according to an estimate from BloombergNEF.

Today, the U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of LNG and has plans to expand that lead over the coming years. This transition to LNG super-producer has shifted the way the country interacts with global energy markets and transformed our entire approach to geopolitics. </p><p>This is how it happened:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fracking</strong><span> – Tech advances, like horizontal drilling, unlocked massive shale gas reserves.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><span> – Companies built massive LNG plants to liquefy and ship gas worldwide.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Global Demand</strong><span> – Europe needed a Russia alternative, Asia needed fuel, and the U.S. was ready to supply.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Policy</strong><span> – Trump lifted export limits and Biden sent LNG to Europe</span></p></li></ul><p>And while LNG is still a fossil fuel, it has some key advantages to other fossil fuels and renewables. It’s cleaner than coal &amp; oil and more reliable and scalable than renewables. In a perfect world 10 to 20 years from now, would we want to totally replace LNG with renewables? Of course. But as we build towards a cleaner energy future, the U.S. is extremely advantaged to bridge that gap with LNG.</p><p><em>From NASA</em></p><blockquote><p><em>NASA’s newest astrophysics observatory, SPHEREx, is on its way to study the origins of our universe and the history of galaxies, and to search for the ingredients of life in our galaxy.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f1272bb0-d9db-4676-a885-44ff131af7db?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8b95efd-2029-468a-9108-8584ed5e0b50_3000x1688.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>Two missions for the price of one rocket launch.</p><p>Earlier this week, NASA NASA launched both the SPHEREx and PUNCH missions aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. SPHEREx will map the entire sky every six months using spectroscopy to study the origins of the universe, galaxy formation, and the building blocks of life. PUNCH, a set of four small satellites, will observe the Sun’s outer atmosphere and solar wind to improve understanding of space weather.</p><p>Both missions are live, having established communications and are now entering their respective commissioning phases. SPHEREx’s data will complement existing telescopes like James Webb, while PUNCH will help predict solar storms that impact Earth.</p><p>These specific missions aside, it’s really cool to watch momentum pick up in space. Writing a newsletter that covers these types of stories makes that momentum all the more obvious.

Hear me out.</p><p>I’ll be honest: I am not a fan of Gavin Newsom. I don’t particularly like Charlie Kirk. And I’m certainly not a Steve Bannon guy. But what I do like is bipartisan dialogue and engagement, especially in long form podcasts. </p><p>Coming out of the 2024 elections, it was clear that the Democrats — as silly as this might sound — had a podcast problem. The medium was dominated by right wing/conservative/Trump-supporting hosts, and those hosts were often visited by Republican politicians that were willing and able to engage in multi-hour, unscripted conversations. Not only does appearing on podcasts with millions of listeners for three hours make you more notable, but for skilled politicians, it provides the opportunity to explain your ideas in a compelling manner and connect with the audience on a deeper level. We saw this with the Trump children on Lex, JD Vance on Rogan, and Trump on Theo Von. </p><p><span> The Democrats did not have the same roster of friendly podcasts hosts — Kamala ended up tapping Alex Cooper of </span><em>Call Her Daddy</em><span> for her first ~longish podcast of the campaign — and did not have the roster of politicians that were willing and able to engage in more casual, long-form discussion. As an example, ahead of the election, the Dems sent John Fetterman on Rogan, the guy who (to no fault of his own) can barely communicate. And sending Mayor Pete on </span><em>The Daily </em><span>does not exactly bring new folks into the tent.</span></p><p>This problem was, and now certainly is, obvious to the Democrats. They’ve been searching for an answer to “Who is the Left’s Joe Rogan?” since before the election. And, for better or worse, the Left’s new Joe Rogan is…Gavin Newsom? Do I think this show will have a major impact on Newsom or Democratic politics? Probably not. But do I think the Left trying to engage in more honest, authentic, long form conversation is a good thing for American politics? Absolutely. The party’s ideas are in desperate need of sunlight — it’s the strongest disinfectant — and they’ve been stuck in the cool shade of 3 minute CNN spots and overly accommodating Crooked Media interviews.</p><p>And why is the Democratic party getting their shit together a good thing? Is it because I am a big lib that wants to see Democrats dominate elections and shape culture and control policy? Certainly not. But I do fear that, at this current point in time, Republicans are starting to pull away with it — demographic changes, blue state exoduses, anti-woke sentiments, etc etc. And when any one party starts to run away with it, we start to see very shitty ideas become very shitty policies. So yes, I want a stronger Democratic party right now. And that, believe it or not, starts with Gavin Newsom apologizing on his podcast for his Covid reservation at The French Laundry.</p><p><strong>(5): Arc Boat, Aalo, Base Power Company, Pipedream, Too Cheap to Meter, and Fuse</strong></p><p>Packy here. This week, I went down to Austin and up to Montreal to spend time with some Vertical Integrators generating, storing, and taking advantage of cheap, clean electricity, and to watch a documentary about how we can achieve the holy grail of producing energy too cheap to meter.

It’s a whole ‘nother thing to see it up close and personal, to watch it charge up its capacitors, and release oodles of energy on a target. In the facility, it doesn’t feel like a science project but an engineering and manufacturing one. Aalo is making actual reactors. Base Power Company is installing batteries on real peoples’ homes every day. Pipedream is out there laying that pipe. And you can actually ride on and buy an Arc Boat and feel the difference between gas and electric for yourself. All of these companies </span><em>sound</em><span> very cool, but I don’t think people fully realize that they’re actually happening. These are businesses. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>The future is electric. </strong><span>An electric boat just performs better than a gas boat - it’s quiet, fast, turns on a dime, is a breeze to dock, and gets better with every software update. Our things will be delivered to us in minutes under our feet via electric robots in pipes. Tons of entrepreneurs — the ones I met with and the ones Jason featured in the documentary — are working on generating, transmitting, storing, and discharging megawatts, then gigawatts, then terawatts of sweet sweet power. I think it’s still underappreciated how electric the future will be, and what that will mean for the quality of products and experiences humans have access to. It also means a whole new toolkit for people who want to rebuild the world. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>It’s really fun. </strong><span>Working on really hard, important problems with really smart, motivated people is as good as it gets. The vibes in each of these offices and facilities are excellent. If you’re thinking about what to do with your life, I couldn’t recommend looking at these companies’ jobs pages more strongly. </span></p></li></ol><p>What a week for the optimists. </p><p><strong><span>BONUS: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b1b64178-c8b7-4fa3-b082-93ac7b7d8f72?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">TBPN</a></strong></p><div><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f0c8b709-e726-4287-ad2d-349bcce25f26?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,h_618,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/l_play_button_usfui2,w_144,e_colorize:0/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F158986800%2F5e35f830-0bd1-4623-8726-2b481d6399cc%2Ftranscoded-00001.png\"></a></div><p>Anytime I have the excuse to pump the Technology Brothers, I will. They’re building the ESPN for startups, starting with daily 3 hour long streams and call-ins. Think of it like (and I mean really visualize it) Howard Stern, Bill Simmons, Jim Kramer and Jason Calacanis banging each other and having the cutest little media baby. That’s TBPN.</p><p>ESPN changed sports. Suddenly sports became a 24/7 spectacle. Being a sports fan no longer meant watching every game. It meant watching the pre and post game coverage, consuming hours of analysis, debating that analysis with your friends, and getting to know the stories behind the teams. ESPN raised the profile of sports: more athletes became celebrities, more people cared and cared deeply about sports, and sports became more culturally relevant. Startups deserve their own version of ESPN.

One interpretation of this gnomic wisdom: in the course of crafting a book, there are shadow books hovering around and inside it. Of course, there are all the gaseous possibilities that preceded distillation into the particular words between the covers. (I probably wrote close to 2x the number of words that made it in—and have fragments and half-formed side quests beyond that.)</p><p>But there’s more to it: a book is not just an object. For me, it was a vast reporting project, a community archive endeavor, an organizing principle for seeing the manifolds of Bay Area life. </p><p><span>My fave strange biologist, Michael Levin, regularly points out that all kinds of biological systems </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/26546ab7-f4be-4220-af67-adbc918759fb?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">have a “bow tie” shape</a><span>. Some enormous amount of information gets compressed down or encoded through a narrow bottleneck. Then, later, that information is recovered or regenerated on the other side. (LLMs take this form, too.) </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e11cf060-4975-4a99-98ee-d4785873b0e5?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07a04b7c-1984-4eef-87cd-9bbb91440559_4093x797.png\"></a></figure></div><p>To me, my printed book is that narrows. Forcing years of work into a hundred thousand words is useful and clarifying. But the conversations the book prompts allow the re-expansion of all those other possibilities in the latent space. </p><p>Which brings me to my other interpretation of Mooallem’s line, and it’s that books form a network, a web of sources and influences. Other people’s books (and other projects) go into your brain and that fragile grey thing is never the same again. I wanted this book tour to reflect that, too, and I’ve been lucky enough to get interlocutors for the different events who have shaped my way of thinking. I can’t wait to expand and regenerate with them, and I anticipate each discussion will be wildly different.</p><p>So, here, let me lay out very briefly, the different tour stops and ~vibes~.

The November 12, 2024 8-K said that another 319 people or 21% of the current workforce were let go in the second round of layoffs (implying a workforce of 1,519 before and 1,200 after). The February 24, 2025 10-K stated that the company had laid off 760 people (foots with 441+319), but that this represented 22% of the workforce (implying a workforce of 3,454 before and 2,694 after). The 10-K states elsewhere that Chegg had 1,271 employees as of 12/31/24. Based on this, we are assuming that the 22% figure in the 10-K is incorrect and that the 760 people fired represent approximately 40% of Chegg’s pre-layoff workforce (760 laid off in ‘24 divided by 1,917 implied workforce prior to June ‘24 layoff).

Honestly, the chutzpah it takes to put those two sentences back-to-back — that was only two months after the Zoom deal signed! Did future debt service just sneak up on you?!</p><p>Starting in November ‘24, the company engaged with an ad hoc group of senior lenders (i.e., the new money and uptiered loans from ‘22)(the “ad hoc group”).

Good luck, Mr. Bhargava, this, on just the CMLS side, is what you’re going to have to contend with:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/397c405d-e9d0-47f4-9831-2ef0c9ef6abd?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f74a301-ba2b-42d1-a55f-1dbbcee74df6_700x241.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: PETITION LLC, Company Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>CMLS</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d813958b-0caf-4f60-840b-0a0891d43334?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"> reported</a><span> FY’24 earnings on February 27, 2025 and … well … you can see how that went over with the market:</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/407506df-c522-493f-bd10-35f07d0d5585?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec1e071-2775-4e34-8fe1-2751b57a4d2a_661x491.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Google.

For FY’24, the company announced total revenue of $827.1mm (a 2.1% YoY decline), adjusted EBITDA of 82.7mm (a 8.8% YoY decline), and a net loss of $283.3mm.</p><p><span>Ok, yeah, sure, the company (sorta) recently completed an LME transaction that, among other things, captured debt discount and kicked out maturities but it still left itself with $671.6mm of funded debt and now sits on just under $64mm of cash. Go ahead. We’ll wait. You can take all of these figures and run some pretty gnarley ratios if you feel like it. The ratings agencies sure felt like it: both </span><strong>Moody’s</strong><span> and </span><strong>S&amp;P Ratings</strong><span> have the company sitting comfortably in junk territory. Similarly the market has taken it all in. As of March 3, 2025, the New Notes were pricing at 35c on the dollar. The new term loan wasn’t faring any better at ~38c on the dollar.</span></p><p>We often hear about companies that have undertaken LME deals being primetime candidates for more potential restructuring down the road. You know, kind of like Mitel ⬆️. Given the secular decline of legacy media and the fact that FCF has gone into the red, the need for this radio operator to right the ship is critical. Absent perfect execution and some innovation, this sucker’s debt looks like it’ll be awfully challenging to refi when the time comes. </p><p>Something tells us you can predict what headline we’ll use “when the time comes.” </p><h5><strong><span>*CMLS ended up reporting that there was a 97% participation rate in their</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c3b9d87f-525e-4a90-ad5f-449b879be6d0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"> 1Q’24 press release</a><span>. </span></strong></h5><div><div><div><p><strong>PETITION</strong> is a reader-supported publication.

Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities</em></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple's Bad Week</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has had the worst of weeks when it comes to AI. Consider this commercial which the company was running incessantly last fall:</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div> <a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/y1gymiZs?cover=1&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;loop=0&amp;muted=0&amp;persistVolume=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=0\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-y1gymiZs.png\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>In case you missed the fine print in the commercial, it reads:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence coming fall 2024 with Siri and device language set to U.S. English. Some features and languages will be coming over the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"Next year\" is doing a lot of work, now that the specific feature detailed in this commercial — Siri's ability to glean information from sources like your calendar — are officially delayed. Here is the statement Apple gave to John Gruber at <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features\">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we’ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We’ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>It was a pretty big surprise, even at the time, that Apple, a company renowned for its secrecy, was so heavily advertising features that did not yet exist; I also, in full disclosure, thought it was all an excellent idea.

In other words, Apple is addressing a space that is very useful, that only they can address, and which also happens to be “safe” in terms of reputation risk. Honestly, it almost seems unfair — or, to put it another way, it speaks to what a massive advantage there is for a trusted platform. Apple gets to solve real problems in meaningful ways with low risk, and that’s exactly what they are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this to what OpenAI is trying to accomplish with its GPT models, or Google with Gemini, or Anthropic with Claude: those large language models are trying to incorporate all of the available public knowledge to know everything; it’s a dramatically larger and more difficult problem space, which is why they get stuff wrong. There is also a lot of stuff that they don’t know because that information is locked away — like all of the information on an iPhone. That’s not to say these models aren’t useful: they are far more capable and knowledgable than what Apple is trying to build for anything that does not rely on personal context; they are also all trying to achieve the same things.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>So is Apple more incompetent than these companies, or was my evaluation of the problem space incorrect? Much of the commentary this week assumes point one, but as <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/delaying-personalized-siri/\">Simon Willison notes</a>, you shouldn't discount point two:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have a hunch that this delay might relate to security. These new Apple Intelligence features involve Siri responding to requests to access information in applications and then performing actions on the user's behalf. This is the worst possible combination for <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/\">prompt injection</a> attacks! Any time an LLM-based system has access to private data, tools it can call, and exposure to potentially malicious instructions (like emails and text messages from untrusted strangers) there's a significant risk that an attacker might subvert those tools and use them to damage or exfiltrating a user's data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Willison links to a previous piece of his on <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/\">the risk of prompt injections</a>; to summarize the problem, if your on-device LLM is parsing your emails, what happens if one of those emails contains malicious text perfectly tuned to make your on-device AI do something you don't want it to? We intuitively get why <em>code</em> injections are bad news; LLMs expand the attack surface to text generally; Apple Intelligence, by being deeply interwoven into the system, expands the attack surface to your entire device, and all of that precious content it has unique access to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, I regret not raising this point last June, but I'm sure my regret pales in comparison to Apple executives and whoever had to go on YouTube <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-pulls-ad-that-showed-siri-being-useful-after-delaying-feature-that-could-make-siri-useful/\">to pull that commercial</a> over the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple's Great Week</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has had the best of weeks when it comes to AI. Consider their new hardware announcements, particularly the Mac Studio and its available M3 Ultra; from the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-reveals-m3-ultra-taking-apple-silicon-to-a-new-extreme/\">company's press release</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Apple today announced M3 Ultra, the highest-performing chip it has ever created, offering the most powerful CPU and GPU in a Mac, double the Neural Engine cores, and the most unified memory ever in a personal computer. M3 Ultra also features Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2x the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion. M3 Ultra is built using Apple’s innovative UltraFusion packaging architecture, which links two M3 Max dies over 10,000 high-speed connections that offer low latency and high bandwidth. This allows the system to treat the combined dies as a single, unified chip for massive performance while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading power efficiency. UltraFusion brings together a total of 184 billion transistors to take the industry-leading capabilities of the new Mac Studio to new heights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“M3 Ultra is the pinnacle of our scalable system-on-a-chip architecture, aimed specifically at users who run the most heavily threaded and bandwidth-intensive applications,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “Thanks to its 32-core CPU, massive GPU, support for the most unified memory ever in a personal computer, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and industry-leading power efficiency, there’s no other chip like M3 Ultra.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>That Apple released a new Ultra chip wasn't a shock, given there was an M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra; almost everything about this specific announcement, however, was a surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with the naming. Apple chip names have two components: <strong>M_</strong> refers to the core type, and the suffix to the configuration of those cores. Therefore, to use the M1 series of chips as an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<thead>\n\n\n<th>Perf Cores</th>\n<th>Efficiency Cores</th>\n<th>GPU Cores</th>\n<th>Max RAM</th>\n<th>Bandwidth</th>\n\n</thead>\n\n\nM1\n4\n4\n8\n16GB\n70 GB/s\n\n\nM1 Pro\n8\n4\n16\n32GB\n200 GB/s\n\n\nM1 Max\n8\n2\n32\n64GB\n400 GB/s\n\n\nM1 Ultra\n16\n4\n64\n128GB\n800 GB/s\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The \"M1\" cores in question were the \"Firestorm\" high-performance core, \"Icestorm\" energy-efficient core, and a not-publicly-named GPU core; all three of these cores debuted first on the A14 Bionic chip, which shipped in the iPhone 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The suffix meanwhile, referred to some combination of increased core count (both CPU and GPU), as well as an increased number of memory controllers and associated bandwidth (and, in the case of the M1 series, faster RAM). The Ultra, notably, was simply two Max chips fused together; that's why all of the numbers simply double.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 was broadly similar to the M1, at least in terms of the relative performance of the different suffixes. The M2 Ultra, for example, simply doubled up the M2 Max. The M3 Ultra, however, is unique when it comes to max RAM:</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<thead>\n\n\n<th>Perf Cores</th>\n<th>Efficiency Cores</th>\n<th>GPU Cores</th>\n<th>Controllers</th>\n<th>Max RAM</th>\n<th>Bandwidth</th>\n\n</thead>\n\n\nM3\n4\n4\n10\n8\n32GB\n100 GB/S\n\n\nM3 Pro\n6\n6\n18\n12\n48GB\n150 GB/s\n\n\nM3 Max\n12\n4\n40\n32\n128GB\n400 GB/s\n\n\nM3 Ultra\n24\n8\n80\n64\n512GB\n800 GB/s\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I can't completely vouch for every number on this table (which was sourced from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M3\">Wikipedia</a>), as Apple hasn't yet released the full technical details of the M3 Ultra, and it's not yet available for testing. What seems likely, however, is that instead of simply doubling up the M3 Max, Apple also reworked the memory controllers to address double the memory. That also explains why the M3 Ultra came out so much later than the rest of the family — indeed, the Mac Studio base chip is actually the M4 Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait was worth it, however: what makes Apple's chip architecture unique is that that RAM is shared by the CPU and GPU, and not in the carve-out way like integrated graphics of old; rather, every part of the chip — including the Neural Processing Units, which I didn't include on these tables — has full access to (almost ((Apple reserves some memory for the CPU at all times, so that the computer can actually run))) all of the memory all of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means in practical terms is that Apple just shipped the best consumer-grade AI computer ever. A Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra chip and 512GB RAM can run a 4-bit quantized version of DeepSeek R1 — a state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model — right on your desktop. It's not perfect — quantization reduces precision, and the memory bandwidth is a bottleneck that limits performance — but this is something you simply can't do with a standalone Nvidia chip, pro or consumer. The former can, of course, be interconnected, giving you superior performance, but that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars all-in; the only real alternative for home use would be a server CPU and gobs of RAM, but that's even slower, and you have to put it together yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn't, of course, explicitly design the M3 Ultra for R1; the architectural decisions undergirding this chip were surely made years ago. In fact, if you want to include the critical decision to pursue a unified memory architecture, then your timeline has to extend back to the late 2000s, whenever the key architectural decisions were made for Apple's first A4 chip, which debuted in the original iPad in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the fact of the matter is that you can make a strong case that Apple is the best consumer hardware company in AI, and this week affirmed that reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Intelligence vs. Apple Silicon</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It's probably a coincidence that the delay in Apple Intelligence and the release of the M3 Ultra happened in the same week, but it's worth comparing and contrasting why one looks foolish and one looks wise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Apple Silicon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with the latter: Tony Fadell told me the origin story of Apple Silicon in a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-father-of-the-ipod-tony-fadell/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2FuLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWZhdGhlci1vZi10aGUtaXBvZC10b255LWZhZGVsbC8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0NDIwMDQ4MSwiaWF0IjoxNzQxNjA4NDgxLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.QbodGT9fDpiEMiQM4l7XIOqEXtV60ndFwV-xVhQQHpuKDC5OHH-EtpHyRXsTj8ay5r78Eh9hb4HRXADe4FDbFwDF-pkHjj8atxvbM51-3BHx-DbszYHCFDwW-3TtvMUXiHDPE0sZTRuejCV5egNcckbcEvwQvyyoriA3dzO6zFCXlzk5NS3QQxShs3q2N8sseD-fbc2QgD6bqHQSJfxyGzwzJNXqZ1WATYib8y9c6GYiGAfjyE07PLCKyOnw2rErsGvoCcrq4eIK46O278jfvwhkr9SAIFqYESDuRquRSzDl8goEDe4Cmt7Q4B5jCWH5L3_gYLpAmNssmBGDPle45g\">2022 Stratechery Interview</a>; the context of the following quote was his effusive praise for Samsung, which made the chips for the iPod and the first several models of the iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung was an incredible partner. Even though they got sued, they were an incredible partner, they had to exist for the iPod to be as successful and for the iPhone to even exist. That happened. During that time, obviously Samsung was rising up in terms of its smartphones and Android and all that stuff, and that’s where things fell apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, there was the strategic thing going on with Intel versus ARM in the iPad, and then ultimately iPhone where there’s that fractious showdown that I had with various people at Apple, including Steve, which was Steve wanted to go Intel for the iPad and ultimately the iPhone because that’s the way we went with the Mac and that was successful. And I was saying, “No, no, no, no! Absolutely not!” And I was screaming about it and that’s when Steve was, well after Intel lost the challenge, that’s when Steve was like, “Well, we’re going to go do our own ARM.” And that’s where we <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/2008/04/23/apple-buys-pasemi-tech-ebiz-cz_eb_0422apple.html?sh=50a064fc7257\">bought P.A. Semi</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was the Samsung thing happening, the Intel thing happening, and then it’s like we need to be the master of our own destiny. We can’t just have Samsung supplying our processors because they’re going to end up in their products. Intel can’t deliver low power embedded the way we would need it and have the culture of quick turns, they were much more standard product and non custom products and then we also have this, “We got to have our own strategy to best everyone”. So all of those things came together to make what happened happen to then ultimately say we need somebody like TSMC to build more and more of our chips. I just want to say, never any of these things are independently decisions, they were all these things tied together for that to pop out of the oven, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is such a humbling story for me as a strategy analyst; I'd like to spin up this marvelous narrative about Apple's foresight with Apple Silicon, but like so many things in business, it turns out the best consumer AI chips were born out of pragmatic realities like Intel not being competitive in mobile, and Samsung becoming a smartphone competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, though, the effort is characterized by four critical qualities:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> Apple has been working on Apple Silicon for 17 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Apple was motivated to build Apple Silicon because having competitive and differentiated mobile chips was deemed essential to their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Differentiation:</strong> Apple's differentiation had always been rooted in the integration of hardware and software, and controlling their own chips let them do exactly that, wringing out unprecedented efficiency in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evolution:</strong> The M3 Ultra isn't Apple's first chip; it's not even the first M chip; heck, it's not even the first M3! It's the result of 17 years of iteration and experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Apple Intelligence</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice how these qualities differ when it comes to Apple Intelligence:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> The number one phrase that has been used to characterize Apple's response to the ChatGPT moment in November 2022 is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google\">flat-footed</a>, and that matches what I have heard anecdotally. That, by extension, means that Apple has been working on Apple Intelligence for at most 28 months, and that is almost certainly generous, given that the company likely took a good amount of time to figure out what its approach would be. That not nothing — <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/grok-3-the-nvidia-shortcut-competitive-implications/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L2dyb2stMy10aGUtbnZpZGlhLXNob3J0Y3V0LWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLWltcGxpY2F0aW9ucy8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0NDIwMDQ4MSwiaWF0IjoxNzQxNjA4NDgxLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.HogmyGQrAUR27NKIJoQblZ1vQuCBTOCp_LkbtA0rctzTsD9l_CWFPcKBa4wzEywXGBLlfjeMjZz1S8Utcxjjvg9TsizNb9iv3aMiHz779E8S5IIebT1O19JkGxlIjcocBB1gVLY597X7aKUQ8Aa0TaGmZW3xMNgaBVkqyn-kHIslaZv-fSQ2upECPd92-WCxVq7r_zedtGPLnEysDn6Oj2REcYYEfUTuCALOcAfwIVBFz8yUXxTfr2gekqwPbS7S7o9_CyioLbjhDTsSnEILb8wFl7J_MvnUFv0rcFL0gYgwWbX2FyxRoycbaIAaSL5lsZYQaSu2OY8G9bOmOfXPDg\">xAI went from company formation to Grok 3 in 19 months</a> — but it's certainly not 17 years!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> If you look at Apple's earnings calls in the wake of ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574934-apple-inc-aapl-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">February 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574934-apple-inc-aapl-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">May 2023</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574934-apple-inc-aapl-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">August 2023</a>, all contain some variation of \"AI and machine learning have been integrated into our products for years, and we'll continue to be thoughtful about how we implement them\"; finally in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4646927-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">November 2023</a> CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on something new:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of generative AI, we have — obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is, because, as you know, we don't — we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit, we're going to do it responsibly and it will — you will see product advancements over time that where the — those technologies are at the heart of them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>First, this obviously has bearing on the \"time\" point above; secondly, one certainly gets the sense that Apple, after tons of industry hype and incessant questions from analysts, very much representing the concerns of shareholders, felt like they had no choice but to be doing <em>something</em> with generative AI. In other words — and yes, this is very much driving with the rearview mirror — Apple didn't seem to be working on generative AI because they felt it was essential to their product vision, but rather because they had to keep up with what everyone else was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Differentiation:</strong> This is the most alluring part of the Apple Intelligence vision, which I myself hyped up from the beginning: Apple's exclusive access to its users' private information. What is interesting to consider, however, beyond the security implications, is the difference between \"exclusivity\" and \"integration\".</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider your address book: the iOS SDK included the Contacts API, which gave any app on the system full access to your contacts without requiring explicit user permission. This was essential to the early success of services like WhatsApp, which cleverly bootstrapped your network by using phone numbers as unique IDs; this meant that pre-existing username-based networks <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/microsoft-eols-skype-skypes-founding-microsofts-skype-charity/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L21pY3Jvc29mdC1lb2xzLXNreXBlLXNreXBlcy1mb3VuZGluZy1taWNyb3NvZnRzLXNreXBlLWNoYXJpdHkvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NDQyMDA0ODEsImlhdCI6MTc0MTYwODQ4MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.WU31p0XDvuxKoRp8DZ-uGZDYuDahmDuNfuVi4LsSXhZw7eQ0Qax8G98kUmrm89FLlF73VE24_7XWD1KiZTinje6ZbLpLh0VWjdG4ip2IINVQTFEX0q5ekwM3FvCOb0IN90CzydjUcDK7rXE5rvwClhFwfDtmssxqaC_zB6Rzq0fBwvwk6lqKhbY0MCOkkUvmx34xoUBUc3wTL8Lk1YznoqpKlh4i-pR7elllig46xcIGD-4OfGKwOLfSD6kyJolkULPHdW41Z0DclvALlhAmqvVbgJaMFksjQQbfEGD29EZpXUoYDDt1iHwN_HyQR3xncRMHcYjxJ--KTBws1f8Zhg\">like Skype or AIM</a> were actually at a disadvantage on iOS. iMessage did the same thing when it launched in 2011, and then Apple started requiring user permission to access your contacts in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even this amount of access, however, paled in comparison to the Mac, where developers could access information from anywhere on the system. iOS, on the other hand, put Apps in sandboxes, cut off from other apps and system information outside of APIs like the Contacts API, all of which have become more and more restricted over time. Apple made these decisions for very good reasons, to be clear: iOS is a much safer and secure environment than macOS; increased restrictions generally mean increased privacy, albeit at <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/portability-and-interoperability/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE5L3BvcnRhYmlsaXR5LWFuZC1pbnRlcm9wZXJhYmlsaXR5LyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ0MjAwNDgxLCJpYXQiOjE3NDE2MDg0ODEsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.cFqrt4KNy8baX9VFwWFoEgM-mQXS6xRAKsGSwDolAdobkQ-ER_1G4XvyrV4QkUbAiCb5MEsyN5E7r6z-jWljEOiTzQ2cIKQ2-kjAXIfPXwN7dr27y7lmDjm1tj9Zo_b_tfE5u76OJjGc6eOoh13KL5tAPwwhNHX__c5kOoo4FOyr7inI3JRLfdkwwGC0DF5Octl_ns10IDLBY7iTG5jzEBxXlJ3gui1MARZmFkN8IDq-DkdtVvxD95Mr2iE9Vzj1xFFu369w8zELXkQQY-4NlLRlPQQ6qKsMnFwqX9TU-XelhuLavWpX7WOItishUJUZSxq0T76_WD6CGZt1LcvQlA\">the cost of decreased competition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it's worth pointing out that exclusive access to data is downstream of a policy choice to exclude third parties; this is distinct from the sort of hardware and software integration that Apple can exclusively deliver in the pursuit of superior performance. This distinction is subtle, to be sure, but I think it's notable that Apple Silicon's differentiation was in the service of building a competitive moat, while Apple Intelligence's differentiation was about maintaining one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evolution:</strong> From one perspective, Apple Intelligence is the opposite of an evolved system: Apple put together an entire suite of generative AI capabilities, and aimed to launch them all in iOS 18. Some of these, like text manipulation and message summaries, were straightforward and made it out the door without a problem; others, particularly the reimagined Siri and its integration with 3rd party apps and your personal data, are now delayed. It appears Apple tried to do too much all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Incumbent Advantage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it's not as if Siri is new; the voice assistant launched in 2011, alongside iMessage. In fact, though, Siri has always tried to do too much too soon; <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/alexa-a-brief-history-of-alexa-amazon-and-apples-mistake/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L2FsZXhhLWEtYnJpZWYtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1hbGV4YS1hbWF6b24tYW5kLWFwcGxlcy1taXN0YWtlLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ0MjAwNDgxLCJpYXQiOjE3NDE2MDg0ODEsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.FF45e94goZHi6W2yEi5m49cw8PSgoHWUYmPlJ6aTsU5eYumb8Ua7GIsBwtOumulmSTz1yncgVgb6HPUMJLsiP-h16I-ji_d9qWaAB1hPSxn3TNguRNwbHlbc0axJAJDYlnTqztAxrMDndaAOCP1mzEnjkn-VrPtb9JCK4GVrWTjiEc-gIDTTipleTS0Te7Sse8Djbz5rcP-GE7Y3ClZ6SE3i8nRim25jfA700rW_BSapWGhO89ZHFWkolBdeXl6najIaLTOuxAFYzIceOOSGFrpsck48iK2U-WuWSaPVJ7dInDKE7x59lWYt-JgZHEZoVhX331fiQCqWu_9NIhtOIw\">I wrote last week</a> about the differences between Siri and Alexa, and how Amazon was wise to focus their product development on the basics — speed and accuracy — while making Alexa \"dumber\" than Siri tried to be, particularly in its insistence on precise wording instead of attempting to figure out what you meant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, this speaks to how Apple could have been more conservative in its generative AI approach (and, I fear, Amazon too, given my skepticism of Alexa+): simply make a Siri that works. The fact of the matter is that Siri has always struggled with delivering on its promised functionality, but a lot of its shortcomings could have been solved by generative AI. Apple, however, promised much more than this at last year's WWDC: Siri wasn't simply going to work better, it was actually going to understand and integrate your personal data and 3rd-party apps in a way that had never been done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I applauded this at the time, so this is very much Monday-morning quarterbacking. I increasingly suspect, however, we are seeing a symptom of big-company disease that I hadn't previously considered: while one failure state in the face of new technology is moving too slowly, the opposite failure state is assuming you can do too much too quickly, when simply delivering the basics would be more than good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider home automation: the big three players in the space are Siri and Alexa and Google Assistant. What makes these companies important is not simply that they have devices you can put in your home and talk to, but also that there is an entire ecosystem of products work with them. Given that, consider two possible products in the space:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI releases a ChatGPT speaker that you can talk to and interact with; it works brilliantly and controls, well, it doesn't control anything, because the ecosystem hasn't adopted it. OpenAI would need to work diligently to build out partnerships with everyone from curtain makers to smart light to locks and more; that's hard enough in its own right, and even more difficult when you consider that many of these objects are only installed once and updated rarely.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple or Amazon or Google update their voice assistants with basic LLMs. Now, instead of needing to use precise language, you can just say whatever you want, and the assistant can figure it out, along with all of the other LLM niceties like asking about random factoids.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this scenario the Apple/Amazon/Google assistants are superior, even if their underlying LLMs are worse, or less capable than OpenAI's offering, because what the companies are selling is not a standalone product but an ecosystem. That's the benefit of being a big incumbent company: you have other advantages you can draw on beyond your product chops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is striking about new Siri — and, I worry, Alexa+ — is the extent to which they are focused on being compelling products in their own right. It's very clever for Siri to remember who I had coffee with; it's very useful — and probably much more doable — to reliably turn my lights on and off. Apple (and I suspect Amazon) should have absolutely nailed the latter before promising to deliver the former.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be generous to Apple you could make the case that this was what they were trying to deliver with the Siri Intents expansion: developers could already expose parts of their app to Siri for things like music playback, and new Siri was to build on that framework to enhance its knowledge about a user's context to provide useful answers. This, though, put Apple firmly in control of the interaction layer, diminishing and commoditizing apps; that's what an Aggregator does, but what if Apple went in a different direction?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>An AI Platform</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While my clearest delineation of the difference between Aggregators and Platforms is probably in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE5L2EtZnJhbWV3b3JrLWZvci1yZWd1bGF0aW5nLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLW9uLXRoZS1pbnRlcm5ldC8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0NDIwMDQ4MSwiaWF0IjoxNzQxNjA4NDgxLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.QG36ksjRdBPUPotNZ8eJdHgak7LG9oXiGtD9t_nziho74zaEHTlgw8Ckf0fkx4UoDD_it6HiOjFi1tiv31gw4s3rcjUUTXzrl7uksiIT6osoKl6omtLvB51TfUimJl4ccNVRqUXMgEEVLhBKerwlus3EVSmaft4_pIi7-dXiAssJRu5a0QhUsAba6dUna84utMuEn2bMwIMgzZdC4_jLIr5wsppK1owidGEtFwdt2vbCwU51F_ngHlk12WEvVhOscAnYQfSExYmFaWoU5z2K3kPn12pEgd9haOLFJXROlSMCiF2Ti5N5qxaB972bOYEH_VGCta36mcW0dZQzP8F41w\">A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet</a>, perhaps the most romantic was in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE4L3RlY2hzLXR3by1waGlsb3NvcGhpZXMvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NDQyMDA0ODEsImlhdCI6MTc0MTYwODQ4MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.qBhRk9OX8cwSYVFDJH9ZUZ3IHyKQcMhSsDyH6G2RYC07svm2ex39eRoRZS6QQ7o0RegpJ03I4BOnm-6W-5qUlx4YuTfVQUhKufulKbKVie3aooZGdnv-d4eC0UodNj46XeRWKiFOfI07FxNhRhQOOHr7IXof4KXrmRByJfyYpOIQ3aR84t2Rrw0KUmMW0QFONz8twR5gFbpk-C-FaF2NAqbuVxllUrhgNQPR-0uPLagPtFZWmoBSHx8B13qDm4bC2Sfowrpl_3x2HTE2uHlvqUv77Ugmn8KjCzLbW0k0hcL-q-i-FrsHvUvQ29iLQGgXnF5CHxgXwIjw4-w165dEtw\">Tech's Two Philosophies</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is certainly an argument to be made that these two philosophies arise out of their historical context; it is no accident that Apple and Microsoft, the two “bicycle of the mind” companies, were founded only a year apart, and for decades had broadly similar business models: sure, Microsoft licensed software, while Apple sold software-differentiated hardware, but both were and are at their core personal computer companies and, by extension, platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.349-1024x552.png\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are products of the Internet, and the Internet leads not to platforms but to Aggregators. While platforms need 3rd parties to make them useful and build their moat through the creation of ecosystems, Aggregators attract end users by virtue of their inherent usefulness and, over time, leave suppliers no choice but to follow the Aggregators’ dictates if they wish to reach end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.251-1024x768.png\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The business model follows from these fundamental differences: a platform provider has no room for ads, because the primary function of a platform is to provide a stage for the applications that users actually need to shine. Aggregators, on the other hand, particularly Google and Facebook, deal in information, and ads are simply another type of information. Moreover, because the critical point of differentiation for Aggregators is the number of users on their platform, advertising is the only possible business model; there is no more important feature when it comes to widespread adoption than being “free.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, that doesn’t make the two philosophies any less real: Google and Facebook have always been predicated on doing things for the user, just as Microsoft and Apple have been built on enabling users and developers to make things completely unforeseen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I said this was romantic, but the reality of Apple's relationship with developers, particularly over the last few years as the growth of the iPhone has slowed, has been considerably more antagonistic. Apple gives lip service to the role developers played in making the iPhone a compelling platform — and in collectively forming a moat for iOS and Android — but its actions suggest that Apple views developers as a commodity: necessary in aggregate, but mostly a pain in the ass individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all very unfortunate, because Apple — in conjunction with its developers — is being presented with an incredible opportunity by AI, and it's one that takes them back to their roots: to be a platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with the hardware: while the M3 Ultra is the biggest beast on the block, all of Apple's M chips are highly capable, particularly if you have plenty of RAM. I happen to have an M2 MacBook Pro with 96GB of memory (I maxed out for this specific use case), which lets me run <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-8x22b\">Mixtral 8x22B</a>, an open-source model from Mistral with 141 billion parameters, at 4-bit quantization; I asked it a few questions:</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div> <a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/XagAx5PM?cover=1&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;loop=0&amp;muted=0&amp;persistVolume=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=0\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-XagAx5PM.png\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>You don't need to actually try and read the screen-clipping; the output is pretty good, albeit not nearly as detailed and compelling as what you might expect from a frontier model. What's amazing is that it exists at all: that answer was produced on my computer with my M2 chip, not in the cloud on an Nvidia datacenter GPU. I didn’t need to pay a subscription, or worry about rate limits. It’s my model on my device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What's arguably even more impressive is seeing models run on your iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div> <a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/s0HmOz24?cover=1&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;loop=0&amp;muted=0&amp;persistVolume=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=0\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-s0HmOz24.png\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0125\">a much smaller model</a>, and correspondingly less capable, but the fact it is running locally on a phone is amazing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is doing the same thing with the models that undergird Apple Intelligence — some models run on your device, and others on <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\">Apple’s Private Cloud Compute</a> — but those models aren't directly accessible by developers; <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/\">Apple only exposes</a> writing tools, image playground, and Genmoji. And, of course, they ask for your app's data for Siri, so they can be the AI Aggregator. If a developer wants to do something unique, they need to bring their own model, which is not only very large, but hard to optimize for a specific device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Apple should do instead is make their models — both local and in Private Cloud Compute — fully accessible to developers to make whatever they want. Don't limit them to cutesy-yet-annoying frameworks like Genmoji or sanitized-yet-buggy image generators, and don't assume that the only entity that can create something compelling using developer data is the developer of Siri; instead return to the romanticism of platforms: enabling users and developers to make things completely unforeseen. This is something only Apple could do, and, frankly, it's something the entire AI industry needs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When the M1 chip was released I wrote an Article called <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-shifting-differentiation/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIwL2FwcGxlcy1zaGlmdGluZy1kaWZmZXJlbnRpYXRpb24vIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NDQyMDA0ODEsImlhdCI6MTc0MTYwODQ4MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.qZ6YZXjRdt2bQjA60QYhknghTBWq_n5LbYrpaB-5xo5D-INm1VU76bCh_rV8ltacIiOMBHBLl0D7887vzZy6pOM1hPCPPRhuNXn4xfwtZ0Z403WMZrvftEwuU_C0ok6rkEsAUmd5PEerzjCgxfYLWfy990rgHSoPrChvBPdtzMQBr-tdAXVT8z_o9LkO6TPPiRaFR4qVbikqT_ojHDDBwL2_6MutGuQVlcWnWI3Gp2bml8mQwpUsMQeDYdTyiInRBfiwkXy0ow7ZWuRlw-hyDnxSLZVjHYK0jmUp8iLWEt6FiBLdCAY1F6GA5pUFLelbW2kUKanzxVkMhmvx1Yw9Xw\">Apple's Shifting Differentiation</a>. It explained that while Apple had always been about the integration of hardware and software, the company's locus of differentiation had shifted over time:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>When OS X first came out, Apple's differentiation was software: Apple hardware was stuck on PowerPC chips, woefully behind Intel's best offerings, but developers in particular were lured by OS X's beautiful UI and Unix underpinnings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When Apple moved to Intel chips, its hardware was just as fast as Windows hardware, allowing its software differentiation to truly shine.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Over time, as more and more applications moved to the web, the software differences came to matter less and less; that's why the M1 chip was important for the Mac's future.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has the opportunity with AI to press its hardware advantage: because Apple controls the entire device, they can guarantee to developers the presence of particular models at a particular level of performance, backed by Private Cloud Compute; this, by extension, would encourage developers to experiment and build new kinds of applications that only run on Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn't necessarily preclude finally getting new Siri to work; the opportunity Apple is pursuing continues to make sense. At the same time, the implication of the company's differentiation shifting to hardware is that the most important job for Apple's software is to get out of the way; to use Apple's history as analogy, Siri is the PowerPC of Apple's AI efforts, but this is a self-imposed shortcoming. Apple is uniquely positioned to <em>not</em> do everything itself; instead of seeing developers as the enemy, Apple should deputize them and equip them in a way no one else in technology can.</p>\n\n

While progress in reducing inflation has been broad based, recent readings remain somewhat above our 2 percent objective. The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue. We see ongoing progress in categories that remain elevated, such as housing services and the market-based components of non-housing services. Inflation can be volatile month-to-month, and we do not overreact to one or two readings that are higher or lower than anticipated. Data released last week showed that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. We pay close attention to a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, and some near-term measures have recently moved up. We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.”</code></pre><p>He continued:</p><pre><code><code>“Looking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\r\n\r\nPolicy is not on a preset course. If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.

The study found that as female brains age, some previously silent genes on the inactive X chromosome \"wake up\" in the hippocampus, a key memory region. One of these genes, </span><em>Plp1</em><span>, plays a role in maintaining myelin, which helps brain cells communicate efficiently. When researchers boosted </span><em>Plp1</em><span> in aging male mice, their memory and cognition improved, and female mice given extra </span><em>Plp1</em><span> performed even better.</span></p><p>This discovery sheds light on why women tend to have better cognitive resilience as they age and opens the door to potential new treatments for age-related memory decline.

I was an idiot (even more of an idiot than I am now if you can believe it) in 2020, and even I could tell that Ramp was going to be special. </p><p>Which would suggest that instead of simply writing about more and more companies, I should go back and revisit some of the best companies I’ve already written about. There’s as much, if not more, to learn from their evolution than from the shiny new thing. And it’s fun to keep myself honest - to see what I got right, what I got wrong, where I maybe took too many leaps, and why, despite that, the call ended up directionally correct anyway.</p><p>Maybe, by studying some of the same companies over time, we can learn a little bit more about the up-and-down journey of the greats while they’re in the process of becoming the greats, before their stories have been injected with narrative collagen to smooth out the unsightly wrinkles (while keeping some charming ones, of course).</p><p>I’m going to be playing around with different ways to follow-up. New Deep Dives on new angles. Profiles on founders. And a lot of conversations.

Primer started running actual schools, competing with a public school product that, while many parents were unhappy with it, was state-supported, Lindy, and free. </p><p><span>Since then, Ryan has begun every </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e9cb83d4-8faa-4adb-afda-c5b825ece1fe?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Primer</a><span> investor update with a reminder:</span></p><p><strong>“This is a civilizationally-important problem and we are willing to go to war to solve it.”</strong></p><p>That’s not what you write when you’re selling Club software. It’s what you write when you’re trying to rebuild a system that has no intention of being rebuilt.</p><p><span>I was wrong about Primer in the way I was wrong about a lot of companies back in 2020-2022, and in the way I think a lot of investors are </span><em>still </em><span>wrong: I thought that software (a clearly superior business model) was a better approach than rebuilding the entire product, atoms and all. That you might really be able to solve the problem with software. </span></p><p>And I’m writing about it now because Primer’s evolution mirrors both the evolution of what startups think they’re capable of doing and how I think about companies, which goes something like this:</p><p><strong>One vertically integrated startup willing to compete with incumbents to fix the actual problem is worth 1,000 startups writing software to improve this or that little problem on the margin.</strong></p><p>If you want to fix energy, you need to build lots of nuclear reactors and install lots of batteries.</p><p>If you want to fix space exploration, you need to build your own rockets.</p><p>If you want to fix air travel, you need to build fast fucking planes.</p><p>If you want to fix housing, you need to build more houses.</p><p><strong>And if you want to fix K-12 education, you need to build schools.</strong></p><p>For two school years, that’s what Primer has been doing.</p><p>Primer partners with teachers in local communities and gives them the tools they need to start their own schools. They help them find a space – a church, a community center, any space that isn’t in use during the day (Primer recently pushed legislation through in Florida to dramatically expand the locations zoned for schools) – handle all of the paperwork to get them up and running, give them software to run the schools, and provide a core curriculum for students to follow.</p><p>Whereas Primer’s software used to be student-facing, most of it is now teacher-facing. This is a big shift, and it meant making big changes on the team side. Now, the goal is to use software to enable teachers to provide the best possible education for the lowest possible cost.</p><p><span>Cost is an important factor when you’re competing against free. In Florida and Arizona, where Primers exist today (Primer is announcing another state soon), parents can use their state’s school choice program to offset much of the cost of school. These programs are growing both in terms of the number of states offering them and the size of the programs, something I’ve seen first hand as an investor in </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3859f388-084a-4d72-b8e5-a710ba48562b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Odyssey</a><span>, which helps state governments administer their school choice programs. (For those getting mad just reading the words “school choice,” watch the video.)</span></p><p>As school choice dollars grow and Primer’s costs shrink, something critically important happens.</p><p><span>In our conversation, Ryan announced for the first time that, “</span><strong>We will have 100% free Primers live in August of 2026. So zero tuition, no out-of-pocket tuition for parents, just use the state scholarship.”</strong></p><p>At free, Primer is the same price as public school, and its goal is to offer a higher-quality education that continues to improve – top quartile today, top decile soon – and costs less and less to serve.</p><p><span>This is the Vertical Integrator mantra: </span><strong>better, faster, cheaper, at higher margins</strong><span>. Primer is applying it to a $1.5 trillion US education market ($870 billion of which is </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b627788b-6542-46ea-85df-a3201ca5faec?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">spent on public elementary and secondary schools</a><span>) – a gargantuan market whose impact as a multiplier on all other markets is even larger.</span></p><p>In its first deck, Anduril wrote “Anduril is a company that will save Western civilization by saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year as we make tens of billions of dollars a year.”</p><p>Primer is pursuing that same promise in education – if it can provide kids with a better education at scale for a third or less of the cost of the traditional public school system, it will save our youth by saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year as they make tens of billions of dollars a year.</p><p>That seems overly optimistic if you view Primer in the context of traditional EdTech companies, which despite their lofty missions have generally failed to produce generational companies. But if you think about Primer as a company whose top line approaches the budgets of US public school systems at high and growing margins, it tracks.</p><p><span>Today, Primer owns a </span><em>minuscule</em><span> percentage of the overall market. There is much work to be done – technological, operational, and pedagogical – to even scratch that opportunity. And given the turning tides for school choice in America, there will be plenty of legitimate competition (not to mention a flood of “competition” from standalone AI tutors, a seeming threat we discuss in the conversation). Education will not be a winner-take-all market, and it shouldn’t. But there will be a </span><em>biggest </em><span>winner, and my bet is that Primer will be it.</span></p><p>Ryan told me that Primer is making three bets:</p><ol><li><p><strong>That there will be a Moore’s Law for Education</strong><span>: that software will help deliver a better and better education for a lower and lower cost.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>That teachers can be excellent entrepreneurs:</strong><span> Primer is relying on teachers in local communities to attract students and provide them with a great education.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>That it’s possible to scale physical schools quickly with asset-light real estate:</strong><span> that by skipping the high CapEx and long timeline buildouts both public and private schools undertake, Primer can move faster and cheaper and focus on the thing parents actually care about: teaching their kids.</span></p></li></ol><p>To me, this is one bet, and it’s the thesis against which I’ve invested in Primer two more times since that initial 2021 investment:</p><p><strong>It is possible to build a better school system, one that gets better and costs less over time. To do that, you need to build something that </strong><em><strong>looks </strong></em><strong>like the existing school system, but that has some of the scale and financial characteristics of a technology business.</strong></p><p>That’s what Primer is building. It offers physical schools. Its teachers teach a core curriculum in the morning, and then give kids the freedom to pursue their curiosity in the afternoon. As states pay more in scholarships and Primer lowers costs, it can offer a product that is free to customers at growing margins. Using technology but not defined by it, Primer can offer students an education that gets better as Primer grows, until it can provide a better education for any family that wants one.</p><p>Which sounds great on paper, but which is really, really hard in practice. Ryan and I discuss those challenges and the tremendous opportunity in our Follow-Up Conversation.</p><p>You can watch the video up top, or watch/listen wherever you prefer:</p><p><strong>YouTube</strong></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9f26dcc4-4131-4214-863f-dd6d3769b79e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/jR3-MFVT0bY\"></a><p><strong>Spotify</strong></p><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png\"></div><img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a255656c4433d6e3e7dee332d\"><p>Ryan Delk: To Fix the School System, Build Schools</p><p>Packy McCormick</p><p>Episode</p><h1><strong>Transcript</strong></h1><p>Listen and read along below:</p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1c9d1cd7-bbea-4a50-803c-a0c3ada642ba?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_48,c_scale,f_png,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Ficon%2FPlayIconRound%3Fv%3D4%26height%3D48%26stroke%3D%25230c2427%26strokeWidth%3D3.6\"><span>Listen now · 46:56</span></a><p><strong>Packy (00:00)</strong></p><p>Ryan, welcome to, this is an unnamed podcast, but what I wanna do here is three years ago, which feels like a crazy long time ago, I invested in Primer and wrote a deep dive on the company and rereading it, some of it's held up really well, some of it has completely evolved, and you've, kind of as my thesis has evolved into vertically integrated companies taking on these sclerotic incumbents, Primer's kind of like, moved into that position as well.</p><p>In this case, it's a sclerotic incumbent that I didn't think was touchable, which is the United States public school system. And so I'm really excited to kind of talk to you just on what has changed and what all of that is and what all of that has looked like. So thank you for doing this little experiment with me.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (00:48)</strong></p><p>Yeah, always happy to hang.</p><p><strong>Packy (00:50)</strong></p><p>So I think, you there's a few investor updates that kind of like I look forward to every month and Primer is one of them and right up top, you say, and you have, think maybe every investor update since the beginning, this is a civilizationally important problem and we're willing to go to war to solve it. Why is fixing K through 12 education civilizationally important and how are you solving it? What does it mean to go to war?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (01:12)</strong></p><p>There’s couple ways I would answer. there's one, think K-12 education in the US is one of those like boiling the frog, it's kind like the national debt where it's like, you talk to anyone, the mainstream view is like, hey, this isn't working. This is probably totally unsustainable. But it's sort of like, it's not acute. It's never acute enough that it's like, have to solve this right now.</p><p>I would argue that the compounding effects of an interest rate are very similar in the negative direction, are very similar to the compounding effects of an education system where, according to the NAEP scores that came out, 80 % of eighth graders are not on grade level on one of the core subjects, at some point that catches up with you and has really, really bad downstream effects for the rest of society, whether that's overall life happiness or career prospects or percentage of families that stay together and have kids and have lives or just overall human flourishing.</p><p>And so it's this interesting problem where it's sort of like, it's like cool to like armchair quarterback this on Twitter and talk about how bad public schools are or whatever. But it's actually, it's been a very sort of intractable problem.</p><p>And historically one where it's been almost impossible to solve the core problem and so everyone's just tried to solve these like small orthogonal problems, which in some ways actually like we, which we can talk about it if you want, we sort of spent a little bit too long solving one of those I think orthogonal problems instead of just going after the absolute hardest problem as fast as possible. And so you have like, know, software, people that sell software to public schools and different things that maybe make an impact on the margins but are certainly not solving the fundamental problem.</p><p>And so I think that this is, for a variety of reasons which we can talk about, this is the moment where you can make a pretty big actual impact on the fundamental problem for K through 12, which is, know, a reductionist view would just be academic progress and getting kids back on grade level and accelerating academic progress back to, you know, at least the grade level standards we had 30 or 40 years ago. But in a more philosophical view, would be things like, you know, students having a better shot at reaching their potential or, you know, living a life where they truly flourish or being excited about coming to school every day or whatever, you know, sort of higher level metric you wanted to use. And then I think the go to war part is as much a reminder for our team as it is for everyone else, which is that this is really, really hard. And there's a reason why no one has succeeded at this. And the incumbent machine is very, very good at making sure that all other alternatives and other supplies is choked out of the market and making sure that the sort of current status quo stays the way that it is.</p><p>And so I think that without the posture of this is going to be a fight and we've got to be ready to come to that fight, you end up, you know, you could end up with a demoralized team, you can end up not being aggressive enough, and we've sort of taken the posture from day one that this is going to be probably the hardest thing that any of us ever do, and we need to wake up every morning, you know, ready to take some punches. Otherwise, you have no chance of, you know, surviving long enough to actually make the impact that you want to make.</p><p><strong>Packy (04:04)</strong></p><p>You anticipated my next question. You mentioned kind of nibbling around the edges to start. So when I wrote the piece in twenty twenty two, really it seems like the core of Primer was software online, these clubs that either were posted by people who were like excellent at kind of educating kids at scale or even some of the kids were making their own clubs. It has all of these like Internet benefits where you can get the absolute best teacher in the world and then you get these network effects almost from more people join, you can find more people to be a part of your club, and all the things that historically you want in your business, those things felt like they were kind of nascently there for Primer. In the same piece, we mentioned that the next week or something, you're about to start launching Microschools, which is a physical product and does not have any of the characteristics that investors like or that you traditionally want to see in a startup.</p><p>Since then, you've leaned pretty heavily into microschool. So what changed from being a software-first company with a little bit of a physical thing to a vertically integrated company with physical at its core and then software enhancing that?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (05:07)</strong></p><p>So I, I mean the original vision for Primer in our very first memo was always to eventually get to micro schools. It was to get to the education that I had growing up. And we had this, I think, too clever by half plan, which looked really good in an investor deck and had a lot of theoretical benefits, but in practice was very difficult to execute on, which was that we were going to build, and we did build, this online platform where ambitious kids, home school, private school, public school, could work on projects together. And they could be student driven or expert driven and We were going to get geographic density and key markets with that platform and Then we were going to launch micro schools in them the communities where we had the most geographic density and We were going to have this sort of zero cac or very very low CAC engine because you have this zero marginal cost software product that is ripping through all the most ambitious kid communities in the US and then you're just upselling them on, wouldn't it be great if your school operated just like this? And all the parents say, wow, that's amazing. So it sounds great in theory. Right.</p><p><strong>Packy (06:12)</strong></p><p>And I'm smiling because this is the bullshit that I absolutely loved and I think probably the biggest lessons that I've learned and luckily I fell for it here. The biggest lesson that I've probably learned over the past few years investing is I could ping pong that too well and be like, my God, it's the most brilliant plan in the world. Why was it not and what changed?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (06:18)</strong></p><p>Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>And so what I realized was that, this was the fatal flaw, was that the company, the team that you architect to execute on the software platform for all the world's ambitious kids to come work on products together is very different than the team that you architect to build a software platform that's going to empower great teachers to launch micro schools, thousands and thousands of micro schools all across the US.</p><p>Vinod Khosla, who's one of our investors, has a saying that the team you build is the company you build. And people often quote that in the context of, if you want to build sort a high performing company or you want to build a top 1 % company, you have to build a top 1 % team, which all those things are true. But actually, I think the more interesting part of it is, at least in our context, is that you have to purpose build the team for the precise product and outcome that you're building towards. just generically hiring great software engineers and great designers, unless you're just building sort of a vanilla SaaS product, is not enough. And so I had this realization as we were launching the first microschools and we were sort of trying to do both that I had basically two teams or two companies inside of one company. And I was very torn up inside over this because the software product was doing quite well by most metrics. And we were getting this incredible feedback from parents. I remember three weeks before we decided to go all in on microschools, which we can talk about, I got an email from a parent who told me that her student or her child had not told her that she loved her in four years and she found Primer and joined these clubs and met all these other kids that also shared her interests and for the first time in four years she just told her that she loved her and she literally recorded a video and sent it to me through tears explaining this. And so we getting this anecdotal feedback from parents which was clearly moving the needle for them for making this huge impact on their kids but we were not solving the fundamental problem. We were not fixing, we were not doing anything really to fix K through 12 education in the US.</p><p><strong>Packy (08:09)</strong></p><p>Whoa.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (08:25)</strong></p><p>Cool community for kids, on the margins, was helping them meet other kids that are ambitious and probably become more ambitious themselves. But they were still all stuck in these crappy schools where the really wealthy families sent their kids to great private schools. And so I had a conversation with one of our mutual friends that you know well, and he basically challenged me, and I was sort of talking about this debate with him, and the challenge that I was trying to think through, and he just looked at me and was like, why would you not just go after the absolute hardest version of this problem immediately? Like, you have the best investors in the world behind you, you have a great team, this is the ultimate vision, just accelerate everything to now and just go after the hardest version tomorrow.</p><p>And I was sort of already leaning towards some version of that. But we had all these kids and users that were really excited about the product. And so we ended up doing that. And I was able to kind of build the conviction internally. And it was very difficult decision. I probably should have ended up way faster. But we took all the software that we built, we put it inside the microschools, and then we went all in on Primer microschools. And that is what we've been working on for the last two and a half, three years now.</p><p>The fundamental problem is a one-for-one replacement for public schools, private schools, charter schools, teachers that love their community, that want to serve their community, can use our software to launch their own school and then give kids an alternative that is typically either free or very low cost and will outperform almost any school that they're in currently.</p><p><strong>Packy (09:44)</strong></p><p>Yeah, there's so much in there. want to before we get there, like just that pivot moment, you're kind of lucky, but also, mean, like the eventual plan, like you said, was micro schools, but you have founders fund and Khosla are kind of the biggest investors behind, behind Primer. And so they're used to things that are physical, real world require a bunch of CapEx might be slower bill interact with the government, all of that. Still, it's like a different kind of thing than, than you'd been tracking towards, and like a kind of accelerated timeline. What were those conversations?</p><p>Like I guess one with the investors but then two with the team because I know also that like even changing you know breather when we changed our sales model from like kind of short rentals to long rentals same team same everything it was a really hard pivot it's like what are those two sets of conversations like?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (10:28)</strong></p><p>The investor side was, I mean, I think for early stage companies, great investors are betting on the founder and to some extent the market, and that's it. So the investor side was very easy. It was sort of immediate, like, all right, if you've got a condition, sounds great, let's talk through the plan, how can we help? The team side was much harder because we had to make a hard, I knew that we had to make a full sort of, All in bet on building this platform to launch schools. And that meant shutting down or shifting a lot of the software that we had built to only live within schools. And there was a lot of, that was a very emotional experience for the team because we had all these kids across the US and the world. mean, literally they would send handwritten letters to our office. I remember two kids, they asked their parents for spring break, instead of taking a vacation, can we come to San Francisco and just visit the Primer office?</p><p>They spent their spring break in San Francisco to come to the Primer office because they just wanted to meet the team. So this was like, you know, classic, like, cult, you know, kind of product. And that was very, very difficult for the team because there was a sense that we were abandoning, you know, these people that been, like, long time users and really benefited from the product. But I think it was obviously the right thing to do, but that didn't make it any less hard.</p><p><strong>Packy (11:43)</strong></p><p>And did people see that? There's also, I think people forget when you hear about companies that there's a mix of senior people who've thought about the strategy and junior people and people who work on certain products and others who kind of have the higher level view. I would imagine some people think that you're a complete idiot at this point and think that you're missing or are heartless or missing these people actually are really getting a lot out of the product. walk me through some of that.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (11:59)</strong></p><p>Yeah. Yeah, we had multiple team members that said all those things and many other colorful versions of that. And I don't actually, I mean, I think, I don't actually blame them. Like, I think that they're...</p><p>I think that as a founder, you have to be honest about the different decision inputs and different decision framework that you're going to have than your team. And there's going to be times when those two things diverge and you can't expect every team member to make decisions in the same way or want you to make decisions in the same way that you're going to make as the founder. And so I knew that I was only doing this to try to build a true alternative to the current K through 12 system in the U.S. And it was only worth every marginal day of my time if I felt like we were doing</p><p>the highest probability path to get there. And once it was clear that it was not the highest probability path to get there, I felt like I had a moral, ethical, fiduciary, opportunity cost, whatever framework you wanna use, obligation to get us to the, once I found this new path that I thought was more of a straight shot, I felt like I had to get us there as fast as possible.</p><p>But I can't expect everyone on the team to also have that exact same framework. These are employees that, obviously they were very bought into the vision and the mission and they were wonderful, kind of all in team members. And some of them said, great, let's go, we're in. And others said, hey, this is not what I signed up for. I signed up to build this thing. And I think that it's easy to villainize them or to say, hey, you don't see the big picture. How can you not see this? But I think that there is just a very different framework that you have as a team member versus a founder, and I think that's fine.</p><p><strong>Packy (13:32)</strong></p><p>Yeah, think it's to be, you want them to be super passionate about the product that they're building and the impact that they're having. It's just hard. moving on from that hard part, what is, how is the micro school product evolved? What is the micro school product and why vertically integrate and then how far do you integrate? Are you building schools? Are you designing the curriculum? How do you choose where to integrate and what to build?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (13:40)</strong></p><p>Yeah. There's basically three bets that Primer is making. The first is that software is going to, that there's almost like a Moore's law in education, which is that you are going to be able to deliver higher and higher quality academic outcomes as measured by the NWA map or whatever sort of nationally normed test you wanna pick for a lower and lower cost. And that some of that will be AI tutors and these things that are coming down the pipe. But other of this is just pure operational efficiency that you can drive by software, like not having teachers fill out paperwork and automating attendance and things like that. So that's sort of one bet.</p><p>The second bet is that teachers are actually phenomenal entrepreneurs - not necessarily in the venture backable sense, but in the kind of small business sense. And the idea of giving them a small organization to run, a small school to run, actually a much higher percentage of them than you think would thrive in that and a much higher percentage than you think would want that. And we've consistently seen, we have thousands of teachers that apply to launch Primers. And they actually really, really resonate with this idea of this thing that becomes their own that they can run and grow.</p><p>And then the third bet is that it's possible to very quickly scale this software platform with real world schools through sort of an asset light real estate strategy. We don't ever build schools, we don't do a bunch of construction. The teachers find the campuses for their schools. We have a regulatory engine that helps them get that approved and that's part of it, so that will all be productized as part of the software. But they're responsible for finding students, finding the location, and that allows us to get to scale very quickly in new markets because our go-to-market motion doesn't look like a traditional school operator.</p><p>Put those together, you have a platform that can deliver, hopefully, a top quartile or eventually top-design education at half or better of the cost to educate per student for the median cost in the states that we operate in. You have teachers that are kind of in the driver's seat running these schools. And then you can scale very, very quickly because you're not sort of encumbered by, our parents do not choose Primer because there are marble staircases and charcuterie boards and champagne galas. They choose Primer because we teach their kids math, how to read, and how to write really, really well.</p><p>And they get time to start companies and work on things they're excited about every day. And so the physical facilities are not the defining characteristic. And so that allows us to open in a lot of places that maybe other people wouldn't want schools, like churches or community centers or libraries or any place that the community really likes and gravitates towards. And so we put all that together. In theory, you can grow really, really quickly and scale this high quality education option at a much lower cost. So that's sort of the bets that we're making.</p><p><strong>Packy (16:28)</strong></p><p>It makes sense. Again, I'm going to draw on the breather thing here. I think if anything, we made a mistake in not vertically integrating enough. The ideal world capital is not a constraint. You just own buildings and then you keep all the margin and all of that. Because the space was the product. For you, it's a very clear, you say asset light up front, it's a very clear decision to save all of that money, save all of that time and put it towards the education. I guess that's a really good heuristic actually is what do customers expect from you and be as good as you can possibly be on that.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (16:48)</strong></p><p>Yep.</p><p><strong>Packy (16:56)</strong></p><p>And kind of throw out the other stuff, do you see over time kind of either you deciding to integrate further into that stuff or giving teachers the ability to decide, you I want my school to be this high-end thing where we do have caviar toasts for our students. How do you think about what happens over time as you earn the right to integrate more?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (17:15)</strong></p><p>I could see us maybe going up market a little bit. I think the market for schools that are highly competent at teaching math, reading, writing, and science is so large, tens of millions of students a year, that it's hard for me to imagine tapping that out and feeling like we need to go further up market to the other things that parents care about on top of that. But in theory, the teachers are in the driver's seat, and so they could choose to push up market.</p><p>But we are laser focused on that segment, sort of the 80 % of the population, where those are the core things they care about. And I think it will take us many years or decades to tap that out.</p><p><strong>Packy (17:50)</strong></p><p>Yeah, it makes a ton of sense, which brings to bet number two, which is how do you build a product that parents across the country can come to trust and give teachers control? What's the balance there of what they can control, what is standardized throughout the system?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (18:05)</strong></p><p>Yeah, we are always toying with this balance. It's basically a question of, we think of it in terms of legibility. do not want to take pedagogical or other types of risk, most parents, on their kids' education. And so there's lots of these schools that have tried these highly innovative, either structural innovations or pedagogical innovations. And I think that just creates a ceiling on the percentage of parents that are gonna be willing to take some bet on some new thing. And so you, think for the segment of the population that we're serving, is sort of like, know, middle class, upper middle class, some lower class families.</p><p>They just want a really good school that's great at core academics and that's like that's that's what they that's what they are they are looking for. And so it has to be legible. The program the curriculum everything has to be legible enough to them that it feels like a one for one substitute for whatever their current school is. And so the way that we do that is we have a very very intense and rigorous core academics that happen in the morning and parents have total transparency into that they can see on their dash parent dashboard everything that's happening every day. We calculate learning velocity for every student.</p><p>And so we can literally project like by the end of the year by the end of the month by the end of the week like where should the student be if something goes off we know why we try to diagnose that But then the afternoon's kids can do these pursuits which are like passion projects like starting companies a lot of the original club stuff They can start companies they can launch podcasts write books And and I think that that is sort of as far as we're gonna push the envelope on legibility where parents can go Okay, like I can sort of understand core academics in the morning these kind of like, you know a creative passion parks in the afternoon and and that is</p><p>That is as far for now as we're going to go, and maybe in the future we'll go further. But that is sort of the mix that we chose right now.</p><p><strong>Packy (19:42)</strong></p><p>It might be early to know this, maybe not. How much does having the passion projects?</p><p>Impact the kids desire to learn in the kind of morning core session I asked because my like son I mentioned this briefly in a newsletter But my son like wants to build worlds and now like I can teach him I can like tell him to do anything It's he's you know, years old I could be like well You obviously have to go to swim class because like you're want oceans on your world, right? Or like we better practice our math because like you need math to do physics and like it works all the time Like if you have that motivation of a thing that you want to get done this morning He was homesick and he was dreaming he like wanted to go back to sleep because he was in middle of a dream</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (20:08)</strong></p><p>Yeah. Yep.</p><p><strong>Packy (20:18)</strong></p><p>…about building this world with his grandmother. He's just obsessed. And so you can jam so much down that. And so I would imagine the projects kind of serve that same function. Does it make kids want to learn more because they have something to apply it to?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (20:22)</strong></p><p>So awesome.</p><p>That is the dream is that every student is experiencing some version of that. In practice, it's very difficult. So one of the things that we do academically is that every student has a personalized academic plan based on where they are. So it's hard to ensure that every student's project that they're working on directly ties in with where their academics are. But in theory, that is where the software we built will get to. That's the long-term goal. There's some.</p><p>You have to be careful because you want there to be some intrinsic motivation. Like it's not just purely to unlock this other passion project later. But the version you're talking about is not as reductionist as just, hey, if you do this, then you get to do this fun thing. It's actually, hey, we need to learn math because it's going to help you build a more robust world or understand how this part of the world's going to work. And that, think, is the connection at its best. And so in theory, that is what we will get to. In practice, it's very hard to do that for thousands and thousands of kids that are all different academic levels, but that is eventually the goal.</p><p><strong>Packy (21:31)</strong></p><p>Totally. All right, which I mean, that perfectly leads us into bet number one, is the software. I love the idea of kind Moore's Law for delivering quality education. Like, what are the different dimensions? see the chips have gotten cheaper and they've also gotten better. are you kind of on this software trajectory or, you know, the slope where in two decades we wake up and Primer is just the cheapest, but also the best education that you can possibly get? Like, how does that play out over time?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (21:57)</strong></p><p>Yeah, I told the team the other day, it's like surreal that there is literally going to be trillions of dollars this decade spent on CapEx that will basically directly reduce our cogs and our cost to educate and improve our academic outcomes at a lower cost. so.</p><p>The latest AI stuff, it's still not quite ready for primetime for AI tutors. still, still host, it's a little bit too high.</p><p>The way we think about AI tutor is the value of an AI tutor is directly correlated by how independently a student can use it. But that often, that is also precisely correlated with the magnitude of the downside if or when it hallucinates or gets something wrong because if a fourth grader is using it independently and doesn't know that it's being taught to mean incorrectly, then you're lodging this thing in their brain that is not correct. But they're getting very close. so right now most of what we've done is on the administrative logistical kind of like, you know, deleting the bureaucracy from the system for educators. And so like, don't think any teacher at Primer has ever filled out a piece of paperwork, for example. Probably some, one of them will email me after this and tell me that they did. But it's not a part, normal part of the experience at all. Like all these things are either automated or taken care of for them, or it's, you know, a couple clicks in their dashboard.</p><p>And so we're pretty relentless on that front. And I think we have a very, very,clean experience for the Primer leaders, which you'd be surprised how big of a difference that makes, just that difference when they come from their old school to Primer. And so now phase two is, how do you start to really improve the academic outcomes while also decreasing costs for students, and then specifically improve the personalization that you can offer? And so right now we use a combination of software tools and virtual tutors for students that need remedial support and live instruction from the primary leader. And in theory, more and more of that will get eaten by AI tutors as they get ready for prime time. And I think we're probably like six months away. If you're working on this, please email me. I want to meet you. Because I think all the technical building blocks are there. It's just going to take someone actually putting it all together.</p><p><strong>Packy (23:54)</strong></p><p><span>I mean, this is one of the things that I love about building a vertically integrated business is that you can be like, I hope that somebody solves AI tutor. Cause then I just plug that into my thing where I've done like all of this actually really hard stuff that nobody wants to do. And so like you want the world to come to you and it's not a competitive threat. I guess the flip side is there a world in which, you we wake up in five years and</span><strong> </strong><span>Apple figures out the vision pro and or meta does and it becomes cheap and then like there is a really good tutor in your classes and like it's just actually better to for kids to sit at home and in a VR with a perfect personalized tutor is like is there something that you think could could knock off Primer that you worry about in the future</span></p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (24:31)</strong></p><p><span>I have a very, very strong conviction that, so lots of people talk about this, AI vision for the future where every student's just sitting at home on a tablet, you know, learning from some AI tutor. That is such a like coastal elite like idea. </span><br><br></p><p>97 % of American families need their kids to go to school because they go work during the day and they need a place for their kids to go. And another 35 % of American families rely on schools to provide some other services for them, whether that's aftercare or lunch or various other things that they literally can't provide for their kids. And so this idea that every kid in America is just going to be sitting at home I think is totally wrong. And so that's actually part of the reason why we specifically decided for Primer to, single Primer as a physical location and we do all that work to help these educators find those locations to get them approved for school use because that is the bet is that that is never going to go away and that is going to be part of the durable advantage is this network of thousands and thousands of physical locations and so even as you know cogs and go down and AI tutors you know get ready for prime time you know kids are still going to need a place to go while their parents are working and and that's that is a like very important part of the bet that we're making.</p><p><strong>Packy (25:36)</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's also, even saying it out loud, like asking the question, didn't mean to make it sound like a but even saying it out loud, you're like, that sounds like the worst possible version of the future that everybody's just sitting inside.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (25:44)</strong></p><p>You have socialization, have all sorts of reasons why that's not gonna happen. But I think the most important one is just structural. Parents just need a place for their kids to go from nine to three or nine to five every day.</p><p><strong>Packy (25:54)</strong></p><p>Yeah. Well, I mean, so obviously right now, wouldn't get into it right now. That role is often served by the public school system in the US. It feels like things are really moving Primers way on the government side, but I would just love to like kind of, could you give us a snapshot in time of why the opportunity right now to kind of rebuild the system that does so much for so many people right now, why that opportunity exists right now from a government perspective, and then we can deal with the antibodies and all sorts of stuff that comes with that.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (26:26)</strong></p><p>I think coming out of COVID, two important things happened during COVID. One, think parents got a different and higher fidelity view into aspects of their kids' think kids were at home, and so they saw more of what was happening from an academic perspective. And I think a lot of parents rethought education. And then on the teacher side, I think a lot of teachers got burned out and kind of like, hey, there's got to be something better.</p><p>So that's one component of it. And then I think that cause or accelerated a lot of the regulatory bodies, sort of that state, local, federal, to think about alternative structures for K through 12 education. And so we had this pretty contrarian view when we started Primer, which is that eventually, micro schools and these kind of smaller, innovative schools would be a very significant portion of the U.S. K-12 education system.</p><p>And basically everyone thought we were insane. And now maybe a lot of people still think we're insane, but fewer people think we're insane. And you can at least squint and see that this could happen. And so I think we've had the state level stuff is probably where the most drastic changes happened over the last four years, where you've had 17 or 18 states come out and say, hey, we're going to give, we're going to create state scholarships for families, basically a tax refund. If you're paying property taxes and state and local taxes that go to fund the public school system, if your kid does not use that public good, you can get a portion of that back and you can use that somewhere else since you're not consuming the good that you're paying for.</p><p>I think it started as kind of a niche idea and then now it's just cascaded to, I think the majority of states will have those programs by the end of this year, which was sort of unthinkable five years ago. so parents are now, I think in the driver's seat, the meta here is that the parents are now more, have higher agency over their students' education and I think there's less of this just pure inertia towards the public school system. And part of that is psychological for parents coming out of part of that is regulatory from states kind of rethinking these programs. But that I think is sort of the meta thing that shifted over the last five years.</p><p><strong>Packy (28:31)</strong></p><p>It makes sense. I've seen this both with Primer and then with Odyssey and like really kind of supporting the ESA kind of payouts and making that easy for parents. Clearly there is a like red blue divide on which states have ESA programs and which don't. I'm hoping like, you know, I'm from Pennsylvania originally, someone like Josh Shapiro can purple it and bring ESAs to Pennsylvania. But, you know, even my sister, when I talk about this stuff positively, is like, what about the public schools? you know, are you just taking</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (28:52)</strong></p><p>Yep.</p><p><strong>Packy (28:59)</strong></p><p>money and like giving you know giving better schools and better options to rich kids and you know leaving the public schools in a lurch like I guess one steel man the argument against kind of school choice or like why are blue states is there a good reason for them to be you know to be a little bit behind there and then two I guess you know address the address your own steel man and and like kind of explain why that might not actually be an issue and why what Primer is doing is not like this evil thing.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (29:26)</strong></p><p>The Steel Man is some version of historically non-public schools have done a poor job of serving students that either fall outside the middle 50 % of students on any dimension, whether that's income or academic ability or behavioral or whatever dimension you wanted to pick. And they have been extremely high cost, both in terms of actual tuition, also in terms of CapEx to get live.</p><p>And so if something is a very high CapEx effort, meaning for folks from the term, meaning like the initial costs that are required, whether it's real estate or otherwise, to get the thing spun up. You have this issue where in like highly rural areas and lower income areas, no one's gonna go through all the trouble to launch a non-public school. And so in theory, if you give parents back this portion of their taxes that they pay for public schools, that money ends up just going to existing private schools.</p><p>No new supply comes onto the market in rural areas or low-income areas because there's no incentive to do that and you end up just you know having $40,000 a year private school now cost 40 or $33,000 a year which doesn't make it any more affordable to a middle-class you know single mother who in theory these programs are supposed to hurt help and So so this is all just sort of one giant, you know handout or something</p><p>And I think that is… That is sort of a very narrow, it is true in the most narrow sense if you assume that it is just a subsidy of demand and not, and it doesn't impact supply in any way. And I think that is part of why people are so excited about Primer is that we are able to, because of the Asset Light Real Estate Strategy, we are able to spin up these schools very cheaply and very quickly, but also in areas that historically would not, you would not be building or launching a new non-public or private school.</p><p>And then you're able to offer that at a price point that even very very low-income families can afford and so we have schools With Primer we have them in you know the wealthiest neighborhoods of many cities But we also have schools where 96 or 97 percent of families are on food stamps And they are in the you the lowest income literally the lowest income neighborhoods of entire states Have Primers and they're thriving and they're self-sustaining and the the communities love it and the teachers love it and so we're sort of</p><p>I think breaking that narrative. And I think that's part of what the excitement is, that historically a lot of the innovation that's happened in education, in full stack education, has either been one-off charter models, where you have one really great school or two really great schools, but it's very difficult to scale, or really high-end private schools, like I won’t name any names, but they've tried and they haven't succeeded, or they've succeeded in a very limited scope at the $50,000 a year price point, but it's never actually made an impact for the families that need it the most. And so I think that's sort of the argument that applies to maybe weight 1.0 of this world, but everything that's shifting now, I think sort of bucks that argument.</p><p><strong>Packy (32:18)</strong></p><p>Yeah, I it like the 2.0, like it is a very interesting and disruptive and I hate that word because it's overused, like, disruptive thing when you can actually bring the cost of the education down as you're getting these subsidies, like where at some point, you know, if you're on that Moore's law curve, at some point, the ESAs, which are, you know, some states, I'm sure like as low as, you know, a couple thousand dollars up to what max of eight to $10,000. At some point you should be like the all in costs should be below that. Like what is the Primer if you're, if you're willing to talk about it, Primer cost to serve now versus what it costs, you know, public school in a similar area to serve a student's education.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (32:55)</strong></p><p>We will have 100% free Primers live in August of 2026. So zero tuition, no out-of-pocket tuition for parents, just use the state scholarship.</p><p>And we are very, very confident in that. That won't be every single Primer, but it will be a lot of them in several states. And we will probably have one or two of those piloting this year in August. So that's the future. And that's part of why I'm so excited about all the stuff that's happening on the software side, is you can deliver these incredible academic outcomes at a much lower price point than it was ever possible. And so when you pass those savings on to parents, you end up being able to, these programs end up being able to have the impact</p><p>that they purport to have, which is for families that can't afford a better alternative, it's giving them access to something that they never would have been able to afford otherwise, and a much better education for their kids.</p><p><strong>Packy (33:44)</strong></p><p>That's amazing. So free for the families just like public school would be taxpayers save whatever the delta is between what it costs Primer to serve and what it costs state schools, what it costs the local public schools to serve. And you have this education that is improving and keeping up kind of over time.</p><p>versus one that is just because it's part of a bigger kind of system, slower and harder to move. It's like a win-win-win. We were talking beforehand a little bit though that there are some people who are not as psyched about this. What's your experience been with the unions?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (34:14)</strong></p><p>Yeah. What to share here.</p><p>The incumbents are very good at staying incumbents, is something you learn in this world. And I definitely did not fully appreciate that. I think I had some broad sense going into starting to build Primer that that was the case. But I did not appreciate the extent to which it was true. And I thought of it more in the sense of, sort of like acute attacks which have happened and we have crazy stories to that end. It's actually the harder thing to overcome is the structural extent to which the kind of incumbent education system has captured every type of regulatory body that acts as a gatekeeper to new supply coming onto the market. And so everything from land use and zoning, to other like regulatory state level or local level regulatory approval that you have to have. All of these things are, you end up in a situation where it is very, very difficult for a new supply to come onto the market. no one, there's not one individual that's sort of culpable for this. It's that the entire system is designed to ensure that you can't get new supply onto the market. And that's part of the structural stuff that we spend a lot of time fighting.</p><p><strong>Packy (35:19)</strong></p><p>You had a big win on that front in Florida. How do you win it? Is it just like waking people up and tapping them on their shoulder and being like, hey, while you weren't looking, it was illegal to launch a school in this open public space, or is it harder than that? Like, what does it look like to change all of that?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (35:32)</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Part of it is like the you can just do things meme. We, I heard from so many, I talked to someone who was like, yeah, for the last 12 years, I've been trying to figure out how we can fix, you know, zoning for new schools. And we just wrote some legislation and found some legislators that were excited about it and we got a pass. And so we changed state law in Florida and opened up 50,000 new locations where you can open a private school.</p><p>And everyone was like sort of, everyone in that space was like, wow, this is amazing. Never thought we would see the day. And I wasn't easy, but it wasn't that. It was not in the top 10 hardest things Primer has done and probably not in the top 100 that we will do. And so it wasn't objectively that difficult. It just was no one had actually gone and tried to actually do it. And so there's things like that that we try to tackle on Spearhead. But it's also, think, it's a...</p><p>It's one of those things where until you are in it, it is very difficult to understand the specifics of what makes it so hard. And so you have many well-intentioned people in the legislature and different governing bodies who think that they've sort of solved these problems and it's not that hard. But when you're in it and you're actually trying to launch schools, you learn the actual mechanics and where the friction points are. And so in some ways, you kind of have to do it to figure out what's broken. And we were in a unique spot to be able to go fix it after that.</p><p><strong>Packy (36:49)</strong></p><p>The like, cynic view on this would be, like there's a lot of different types of cynic view. The business cynic view of this is like, damn, you're doing a lot of hard work to like, build an ed tech company and like, aren't these the worst businesses of all time? Like, what is the market opportunity? like, when you think about Primer as a business, like how do you think about that and what the kind of upside is there?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (37:08)</strong></p><p>For the last 50 years, the only thing you could do in the education world was this sort of thin slice of the market that we called EdTech, which was basically software that was either sold to public schools or to parents. And it was this very thin slice of, we spend $1.5 trillion a year on K through 12 education in the US. was this tiny little, low tens of billions of dollars spent, component of that. And that entire segment produced basically zero generational companies or organizations, very few amazing outcomes for the world or for investors or whoever.</p><p>And so, and I think that was a structural, it was a structural limitation, which was that the majority of this $1.5 trillion a year was basically just totally locked down, kind of one shot to public or charter schools. And there was nothing that parents or anyone else, there was no discretion over any of that. was just sort of, it was just gonna keep happening. And so if you wanted to do anything and try to improve anything or build organizations in the space, you either had to do it sort of at very small subscale, very small scale, you know, build one charter school or something like that. Or you had to just play in this sort of software space with these two year long procurement cycles and terrible margins, all that. And now, because of all these structural shifts, is the first time where you can actually go innovate on the bulk, like the foundational problems, which is the actual schools themselves. And you can go build alternatives.</p><p>And so I think… I think that it would be a mistake to conflate what's going to happen over the next 20 years of folks building things in education to what's happened for the last 20 years. I think that the opportunity now, think that we finally have a chance to try to improve and attack some of the hard foundational structural problems that have basically been off limits, not for lack of good intentions, but just because of the structure, that have basically been off limits for the last 30, 40, 50 years. And so obviously, there's a lot of execution risk and very hard problems to solve still, but the structural stuff has been unlocked. And so now it's up to us and hopefully many others to go improve the lives of families and kids and deliver great outcomes.</p><p><strong>Packy (39:16)</strong></p><p>When I hear like a $1.5 trillion, like there's very few markets that are the size of a defense, the defense budget is 900 million billion in the US. But if you include allies around the same size, like would it be easier for you to fundraise if you have like a physical school that you just like dropped in in different places and it like looked like you were doing this like hard tech thing or like it does feel to me like when you talk about it that way.</p><p>And when you really think about the business, like one of those kind of knocking over the defense primes, size opportunities, is it easier if you have a shiny physical product or what's that like convincing new investors?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (39:51)</strong></p><p>We've been pretty lucky on that front. We have a great group of investors that are very long-term ideologically aligned. And so I think we are very lucky. And I think that part of that is that our team is this mix of people that have come from the traditional education world. So we have people that have built some of the most iconic schools in the US that have a lot of hard-won battle scars and have been doing it for decades. And then we have people from the tech</p><p>and startup world that have built many iconic software companies and been early at places like Uber and Coinbase and other companies. And so I think that Nix has allowed us to attract a bunch of very high caliber capital. But I do think there's there, I do often think of that, if you were doing the more sexy version of this, then maybe it would be a little bit more hypey. But I actually think it's quite, I think staying under the radar</p><p>little bit and kind of just sort of building the version of this that really works for like blue collar, know, everyday Americans actually is the right long term, long term bet. And I think that that we are that is now like increasingly obvious to the market.</p><p><strong>Packy (40:59)</strong></p><p>How do you see the market playing out? Is this winner take most? Is this, there's gonna be a million different players? When you are doing all that hard work in Florida to get all these spaces approved, can there now be 10 other companies that come in behind you and say, awesome, we're gonna use that to launch schools as well? Or does the software side make it, you think, take most at the end?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (41:19)</strong></p><p>I don't think it's winner take all. mean, there's 80 million-ish kids in the US and it's one and a half trillion dollars a year of total spend. part of the promise of what's happening is that you will have a much higher aperture or variance of types of options available for families and so I hope that Primer eventually can be the platform that you folks launch amazing you know farm schools or technical immersion schools or language immersion schools or Religious schools are all sorts of different things that that you could use the Primer platform to launch</p><p>But I also think that we need a lot more types struck structural innovations people trying crazy crazy ideas and so I hope that part of what happens over the next 10 years is that you have much higher variance people trying You know things that have never been tried before to see if they work I think for for students with special needs there's a huge underserved market there that we have not You know really done a lot or explored but that's something that I feel I'm personally very interested in and invested in and And would like to to for primary part of the solution there, but that's something that's there's an amazing autism school in Phoenix, for example, has been able to grow tremendously because of lot of the legislative changes, but also deliver just incredible outcomes for these students that, as far as I'm aware, have literally never happened anywhere in the US, and now they're taking that same model and scaling it to a bunch of other states.</p><p>And so I think that that, it is definitely not one or take all. It is an enormous market, and I hope that the end state is every family and every student being able to find something that is closer to the ideal school for them, rather than this sort of one size fits all sort of defaults that we've been operating with for the last 50 years.</p><p><strong>Packy (42:57)</strong></p><p>I guess kind of snapshot moment in time right now, so when we revisit this again in three years, what can you give me on revenue growth? Like where were we in 2022? Where are we now? Where do we expect to be in the next kind of two to three years?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (43:10)</strong></p><p>Yeah, we're we've grown about 5x… 4.7x year over year from last year to this year.We will be announcing expansion to a new state. I'm actually here right now in our office in said state and We'll be announcing that soon. We'll do another another with another new state expansion lineup for next year.</p><p>So yeah, are, we are operationally, the constraint right now is operational capacity, not students or teachers, which I think is the problem you want to have, but is also the most frustrating problem because it is 100 % under your control and there's only one person to blame for not increasing capacity, which is yourself. And so that is what I'm spending all my time on right now. But I hope that three years from now we will have ubiquitous free Primers that are available to families across many states and that are delivering top quartile or hopefully maybe top decile academic outcomes at either free or very, very low cost for families. at that point, I will feel very confident in our ability to scale that to many hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of students.</p><p><strong>Packy (44:18)</strong></p><p>What are those big unlocks that kind of get you there? Are there like step changes where all of sudden, maybe in 10 years it looks like the federal government's like, great, we're dropping Primer and everywhere. That's obviously a ridiculous case, but are there big unlocks like this or is it just like we're grinding this thing, compounding for the next decade or two?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (44:36)</strong></p><p>We don't need any big structural unlocks. think there will be a lot of stuff that will happen on the software side that will keep pulling costs down and pulling academic outcomes up. But I suspect that will be, some of the AI stuff will probably feel like a step change when we're able to implement that. But a lot of it is just gonna be, we have better data, I think we have a better data set than any education provider on the planet because of the way that we've architected the operating system.</p><p>We are able to predict which interventions are going to work, recognize when learning velocity dips below the projected amount for a student that intervene in a way that I think probably no school on the planet can. And so a lot of this will just be letting that compounding advantage continue to play out, improving the product, improving the program. And if we can continue that, I think that it won't require any big structural unlocks. It'll just keep getting better every year.</p><p><strong>Packy (45:29)</strong></p><p>All right, so kind of just two last questions.</p><p>One, if you could go back and tell Ryan in April 2022 when I wrote the Deep Dive on Primer, if you could go back to the past and give him one piece of advice over the next three years, what would it be?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (45:43)</strong></p><p>It's gonna happen faster than you think, so be more aggressive.</p><p><strong>Packy (45:47)</strong></p><p>Be more aggressive is great. And then if there are people, and this is the last one, people who want to get involved, want to be more aggressive, want to help solve that operational constraint, what are you hiring for right now? What's the best way to kind of turn this into going to work at Primer?</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (46:01)</strong></p><p>Hiring for almost every role across the company, marketing, growth, operations, admissions, engineering, design, product, education. email me r at Primer.com if you have a proclivity towards the types of problems that we've talked about and you're interested in working extremely hard on trying to solve it. It will be the hardest thing you've ever done, but it hopefully will be the most meaningful work of your life. And if you're a teacher that's interested in launching a school,</p><p>Either in Florida or Arizona or other states, please email me because I'd to add you to the list and get you involved in that when we're there.</p><p><strong>Packy (46:32)</strong></p><p>Ryan, thank you for doing this. I definitely get excited when I write about companies and somehow as excited as I was when I wrote about Primer in the beginning, just kind of getting to know you and the company more over the past three years. This is just a massive opportunity that if it goes right, you can't think of a bigger lever on kind of everything downstream. So I can't wait to do this again and kind of follow the story over the next three years. But thank you for doing what you do.</p><p><strong>Ryan Delk (46:55)</strong></p><p>Thanks, Packy. Always fun to hang.</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan for the great conversation! </em></p><p><span>That’s all for today.

Notably the stock was up 3% yesterday, March 4, 2025, on a day that the market otherwise puked all over itself. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The company reported revenues of $894.9mm for 4Q’24, down 3% YoY, and $3.7b for FY’24, up 6% YoY. 4Q’24 adjusted EPS came in at $1.38 vs $2.28 in 4Q’23 while FY’24 adjusted EPS grew to $7.99 compared to $7.71 in FY’23.</p><p><span>While those numbers were, on their face, not overly terrible, the market was more focused on the unexpected revenue drop after a very strong 1H’24. CEO, </span><strong>Steve Gunby</strong><span>, was prepared to address this. Here he was on the earnings call:</span></p><pre><code><code>“Let me start with 2024. As I think many of you know, we had a terrific, terrific first half of the year. Revenues, you may recall, were up 12% and EPS grew 48% compared to the first half of 2023. Now some of that strong performance in the first half was because we were cycling a slow first half of 2023, but it's also somewhat because of what we did.”</code></code></pre><p>Double “terrific.” Right on. </p><p>He continued:</p><pre><code><code>“Let me turn to the second half of the year. We always expected that year-on-year growth would be slower, mainly because we knew we were cycling a much stronger second half of 2023. But the sales we actually got in the second half of 2024 turned out to be even a bit slower than we expected. Last quarter, we talked about the fact that we only had revenue growth of 3.7% year-on-year, which is among the slowest growth we have seen in a while. This quarter, we were actually down year-on-year and down sequentially.”</code></code></pre><p>“Down year-on-year and down sequentially.” </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5fb22f21-d2b6-4642-92d3-813c40694efb?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_350,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d2bd522-3c76-4b79-91b3-964a6e587854_350x353.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>As if to make matters worse, Mr. Gunby didn’t exactly present confidence-inspiring guidance: </p><pre><code><code>“Now I think most of us on this call know that our multiyear growth, the performance of this company over time has never been a straight line up, and we never expect it to be. However, I did want to point out that we did expect the business to be a bit better in the second half. We knew it was going to be slow and it actually turned out to be worse. That's somewhat important for explaining 2024 results, but it's also important because it presents a revenue trajectory that is carrying into 2025 as a headwind.”</code></code></pre><p>Mr. Gunby’s caution stems from the fact that (i) one group (not RX) experienced a number of senior departures, (ii) M&amp;A was down, (iii) international work was depressed (he noted the UK as an example), and (iv) sales slowed down in FTI’s strategy business in Corporate Finance. About RX, Mr. Gunby had this to say:</p><pre><code><code>“Revenues of $894.9 million decreased 3.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower demand in our Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring and Technology segments … Worth noting, the fourth quarter of 2023 was an exceptional quarter, a quarter when three of our five segments, Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring, Economic Consulting and Technology delivered at the time, record quarterly revenues in what is typically our slowest quarter of the year.”</code></code></pre><p>Okay, but: </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fe80135a-f0bc-43f2-aaa1-51aca352b35f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50385196-9d8d-46e8-9251-0c702f2bb622_480x480.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>Not enough. </p><p>We live in a savage, savage world. </p><p><span>Here is CFO </span><strong>Ajay Sabherwal</strong><span>: </span></p><pre><code><code>\"To better align capacity with demand, we reduced headcount in Q4, resulting in a special charge of $8.2 million related to severance and other employee-related costs. These actions continued after the new year, which will result in an additional estimated special charge of approximately $17 million in Q1.\"</code></code></pre><p>He continued: </p><pre><code><code>\"Sequentially, billable headcount decreased by 26 professionals or 0.4% and non-billable headcount increased by 18 professionals or 1%. The sequential decrease in billable headcount was largely due to headcount actions taken in the fourth quarter, which particularly impacted our Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring and FLC segments.\"</code></code></pre><p>Wait. Did FTI RX perform an operational restructuring on FTI RX? Too bad that sh*t isn’t billable. But why? Why is this happening? </p><pre><code><code>\"In Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring, revenues of $335.7 million decreased 8.2% compared to Q4 of '23. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower demand for transformation and strategy and transaction services.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, restructuring represented 47% of segment revenues. Transformation and strategy represented 31% of segment revenues and transactions represented 22% of segment revenues. This compares to 44% for restructuring, 34% for Transformation and strategy and 22% for transactions in Q4 of '23.\r\n\r\nAdjusted segment EBITDA of $44.7 million or 13.3% of segment revenues compared to $65.4 million or 17.9% of segment revenues in the prior year quarter.\"</code></code></pre><p>EESH, we get it was a tough YOY comp but still. Restructuring revenues were flat sequentially in Q4’24 versus the prior quarter. </p><p>And there’s no reason — especially with that guidance — to expect much improvement. </p><p><span>So, how is Q1’25 looking so far for FTI? Not amazing. Subject to the caveat that our data is largely manually kept and it’s accuracy depends on the magnitude of Johnny’s thrice-weekly benders, FTI has only been involved in two company-side matters thus far (</span><strong>Ligado Networks Corp.</strong><span> and </span><strong>Jervois Texas LLC</strong><span>); it has not secured any FA mandates for any official committees of unsecured creditors.*</span></p><p>To summarize, the rise of LMEs means a decline in large bankruptcies and the ones that do file typically tend to have shorter lifespans (sans a regulatory overhang like that in Ligado). Or the filings are in the lower to middle market — a part of the industry where FTI is vulnerable to smaller, nimbler firms, who rejoice in undercutting FTI on price. If this all continues, there’s plenty of reason to buy in to Mr. Gunby’s cautious ‘25 guidance. </p><p>*****</p><p>The question is: will these trends continue? Putting aside the consensus view that a lot of the LME 1.0 deals will cycle back in need of a formal in-court restructuring (end of ‘25? early ‘26??), there are other, newer externalities at play. </p><p><span>Indeed, as we write this </span><strong>President Trump</strong><span> is slapping fresh tariffs on China and our North American neighbors and policy uncertainty is reverberating through markets. </span></p><p>Do you remember how we kicked off this edition …</p><div><div><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fb044abd-2340-473d-b881-9fda4e09c5e3?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><picture><source><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacee880-47d6-444e-8c47-62d437f3e302_1600x1143.png\"></source></picture></a></div><h4><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fb044abd-2340-473d-b881-9fda4e09c5e3?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">💥23andMeh💥</a></h4><div>Feb 23</div><span>Read full story</span></div><p><span>… by asking, “</span><em>Are things feeling just a wee bit wonkier these days or is it just us?</em><span>” </span></p><p>It’s not just us. </p><p>It’s also the S&amp;P 500 index:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a6d4cad1-7836-44e1-8d4b-fff2a1e85a94?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F596538f5-98aa-4b3c-9852-37a1edccbccb_662x464.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Google</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/359bf0e8-4c0e-4fa0-b38c-9536e09d78d7?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe826a2d8-2798-4460-9c3b-d8106ac072b1_658x465.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Google</figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s (definitely) the Nasdaq Composite:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/90f3aaf6-6337-4c62-9991-dba619dff8e8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f844358-d53d-4ae0-874a-e3b764f8af35_664x463.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Google</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It’s the </span><strong>Atlanta Fed</strong><span>: </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f245524c-de30-441b-ae1b-90251d2e5a54?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_536,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48abc1e3-f08d-486f-af97-777d474a802b_536x571.png\"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/cf1af32c-04f4-4cd4-b2d8-23b0d7709990?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">@Geiger_Capital </a><span>on X</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s the consumer.

Like those Canucks, Tuesday’s chippy AF too. Why?

First up, the DIP and bid pros objection, where Mr. Finestone serves up some Grade-A beef with the debtors’ searing desire to lien up and then sell those insider, not-market-tested claims. But as fine a writer as Mr. Finestone is,**** the substance is the same, basic, color-by-number argument we’ve all seen dozens of creditors’ committees toss together. You know, that somehow </span><em>certain</em><span> unencumbered assets should be outside the reach of lenders ponying up new money to finance a bankruptcy process they didn’t create and </span><em>some</em><span> assets ought not be put into a sale process. Why not leave that “work” to them then? Because there’s no committee; GUCs didn’t want to spend any time on this turd.</span></p><p><span>Those claims also star in the examiner motion, alongside the ~$71mm deficiency claim the prepetition lenders will have if the sale goes through.

Truth be told, the motion’s lack of commitment left us wanting more, so mandatory hook it is. Look, we get it, Tuesday doesn’t have much by way of discovery, but assertions like Mr. Gundumogula “</span><em>may have engaged in improper insider trading and manipulation of the Debtors’ stock</em><span>,” “</span><em>potentially plundered their assets</em><span>,” and “</span><em>may have absconded with corporate assets</em><span>” ring kinda hollow. Tuesday also wasn’t pleased that … we wish we were making this part up … Mr. Gundumogula, an Indian man, traveled to India, where the debtors have material operations, during the weeks leading up to the bankruptcy. Anyway, these claims, says Tuesday, beg to be investigated by “</span><em>an independent and disinterested party like an examiner</em><span>” because the court can’t rely on folks with purported-yet-evidenceless “</span><em>blatant conflicts of interests</em><span>” like the debtors’ special committee of </span><strong>Tim Pohl</strong><span>, </span><strong>Neil Goldman</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Lawrence Hirsh</strong><span>. Suffice to say, the “mandatory” prong was the main issue, and to evade that, the debtors had to get creative, which they did by scheduling all unsecured claims as, lol, contingent, disputed, or unliquidated.*****</span></p><p><span>After a few weeks of flinging paper around the docket, it all came to a head at a February 20, 2025 hearing. Well, maybe we should say “started to come to a head.” If you ask the debtors, the hearing was supposed to come and go the same day, but the court had to call it quits after 3.5 hours, right in the middle of Mr. Finestone’s cross of the debtors’ Chief Restructuring Officer </span><strong>Mohsin Meghji</strong><span> (of </span><strong>M3 Advisory Partners, LP</strong><span>).

However, the debtors </span><em>did</em><span> need more cash; no one really disputed that – marketing professionals like theirs don’t work for free – so during the interlude, the DIP lenders agreed, like they had an option, to fork over more and increased the DIP from $27.5mm in new money to $30mm.</span></p><p><span>Good thing too because the debtors will need it for all the prof fees they’re racking up. The February 25 hearing stretched another, </span><em>sigh</em><span>, 6 hours. And while tempers flared mildly, at least it all mercifully came to an end. But still no answer. Instead, the court decided to mull it over before ruling, which happened a couple days later on February 27, 2025.</span></p><p>Anyone wanna take a stab at the outcomes?</p><p>Bidding procedures are easiest.

And yet, we wouldn’t call it a knock-out win for the debtors; the court left them with this:</p><pre><code><code>“[T]he findings of an investigation are subject to the adversarial process. The court scrutinizes a sale to an insider, particularly where no official committee has been appointed to investigate the conduct of the debtors’ management, the operations, and potential causes of action. Here, given the mandate of the independent restructuring committee and the debtors’ representation with respect to the disclosure of their findings as well as the debtor's fiduciary out [under the RSA], there are sufficient procedures in place to protect the integrity of the process…\r\n\r\n… To promote the integrity of this process … [i]f the debtors intend to sell causes of action at a sale hearing, the restructuring committee will need to provide all findings as part of the evidentiary record well in advance of a sale hearing. While the court appreciates there may be privilege issues, the court does expect sufficient disclosure.”</code></code></pre><p><span>“Sufficient,” huh? Go ahead and pencil us in for another Mondee update sometime in the future after more “</span><em>adversarial process</em><span>.”</span></p><p>Finally, the DIP. That was, to our surprise, a Tuesday ‘W’ of sorts. No, the court didn’t deny the motion outright, but she put a few conditions on the financing to assuage her concerns about liening up non-valued insider claims subject to an ongoing investigation. The fix? A grant of a DIP lien on causes of action, but only for the new money, not the $82.5mm roll-up. That’s all well and good, but as all y’all know, dollars be fungible. Yeah, that didn’t get past Her Honor, who is also requiring the lenders to marshal away from those claims as a source of recovery until the rest of the DIP collateral has been exhausted.******</p><p>Bold strategy, but do y’all really think the DIP lenders — the ones who signed an APA to purchase those claims — are just going to take that?</p><p>HAHAHA, trick question.</p><p>Hell yeah they did. Rolled right over. A debtor-revised order incorporating her ruling was entered the same day.*******</p><p>So now the debtors are off on their “marketing and sale” process. Quotations because it’s marketing-and-sale in name only. If you didn’t notice, the lenders are basically giving this company away. It’s going to yield f*ck all.</p><p>We’ll officially find that out around March 18, 2025, the bid deadline. A sale hearing is slated to follow on March 26, 2025, but that could change. The results of the investigation aren’t available yet, and the court was clear that if Tuesday doesn’t have a decent chunk of time to prepare, she’s not afraid to break out her kickin’ boots again.

It’s been 4.5 years since I used this newsletter. I tell you with a mostly straight face that social media is of the devil and I put Substack under that blanket as well, but horses for courses. </p><p>The course I’m currently horsing is trying to write another novel, so I’m getting the rust off this here substack and maybe occasionally (monthly? IDK) posting something visible and public. Because I like you am a bramble of contradictions, the public writing will probably be only somewhat scrutable and thus self-defeating. But it will exist, and it will mostly be me celebrating art that gets me good and making jokes.</p><div><div><div><p>Thanks for reading no coast offense!

GCP is one of the newest shops on the block, founded in March ‘24 after a handful of folks, including </span><strong>Edward Kim</strong><span>, defected from </span><strong>Force Ten Partners LLC</strong><span> (“Force Ten”).* But they’ve had success pitching and winning a lot of engagements. Specifically, a none-too-shabby 9 in ‘24 after only existing for 3 of its quarters. That was enough to land the firm in a tie for the 11th spot on the ‘24 Octus </span><em>Americas Restructuring Rankings</em><span> for most company and creditor engagements.</span></p><p><span>On those same rankings, GCP found itself in the 8th overall spot on raw “fees per day” ($14,050), beating out the likes of </span><strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong><span> ($13,316), </span><strong>AlixPartners </strong><span>($10,171), </span><strong>Huron Consulting</strong><span> ($7,043), and even their former colleagues at </span><strong>Force Ten </strong><span>($6,281). To be 1,000% clear, there’s no per-capita element to that ranking system. That is, GCP, “</span><em>a small advisory firm with fewer than 10 professionals</em><span>,” billed more per day than those several-times-larger competitors.</span></p><p><span>Which brings us back to the debtors. On November 19, 2024, GCP filed its final fee application for its “work” in those cases.

Here are his Terraform-specific thoughts:</p><pre><code><em>“[S]ix to eight Genesis timekeepers—essentially every single person in the firm—often billed to attend the weekly or biweekly Committee meetings…\r\n\r\nGenesis similarly employed its all-hands-on-deck approach to internal calls and communication … In fact, filtering Genesis’s invoices for time associated with ‘discuss(ions),’ ‘call(s),’ ‘communication(s),’ ‘meet(ings),’ ‘review,’ ‘debrief,’ ‘conversations,’ and ‘follow-up’ with only the ‘GCP Team’ shows that Genesis billed an incredible $1,387,450.00 (2,139.3 hours) for these internal meetings…\r\n\r\nGenesis routinely failed to assign the appropriate profession to tasks, resulting in partners and other premium billers performing low-level work. Of the $4,090,575 billed by Genesis timekeepers, only $332,190—8.1%—was billed for work performed by the three analysts on the team…\r\n\r\nGenesis’s unreasonable, top-heavy approach is exemplified in its billing entries related to legal research—a task that does not seem appropriate for any of Genesis’s non-attorneys, especially when the Committee had retained sophisticated legal counsel for that precise purpose…\r\n\r\nGenesis billed the Committee for time that it spent pitching itself to the Committee to become the Plan Administrator… Rather than advancing the Committee’s objectives, Genesis focused on creating polished presentations, crafting slide decks, and pitching materials aimed solely at positioning itself as the Plan Administrator. Considering that Genesis ultimately failed in its bid to be appointed as the Plan Administrator, it is impossible to understand why Genesis believes that its self-promotion should be compensated at the estate’s expense, draining assets meant to benefit creditors while providing no benefit.”</em></code></pre><p><span>LOL, legal research??? What?!? They couldn’t trust the work of the UCC’s counsel, </span><strong>McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP</strong><span>, on that? They’ve got </span><strong>Darren Azman</strong><span> for heaven’s sake!!! You shouldn’t need us to tell you that a financial advisor’s performance of legal research is absurd on its face. It’s not their role. But in case there are any lingering doubts out there, the plan administrator also clarified that not a single person at GCP is an attorney, 😂.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of only about 12%. </p><p>In a phase 1 trial, patients received surgery, a PD-L1 inhibitor, chemotherapy, and a personalized mRNA vaccine. At the 3 year mark, 75% of patients were cancer free. Moreover, responders with vaccine-induced T cells had significantly longer recurrence-free survival compared to non-responders, meaning those that responded to the vaccine went much longer without their cancer coming back than those who didn’t respond. </p><p>The research shows the vaccine created immune cells that lasted for years, stayed active against cancer, and could help prevent it from coming back. 85% of vaccine-induced T cell clones persisted for at least two years, with a median lifespan of 7.7 years and some projected to last decades. The T cells maintained strong anti-cancer activity and infiltrated recurrent tumors, meaning they could help control cancer over the long term.

Now, another gene therapy restored hearing in deaf children. This is a miraculous trend. </span></p><p>Regeneron's gene therapy DB-OTO showed significant hearing improvements in 10 of 11 children in the trial, with some reaching near-normal levels of hearing. Wild. Here’s how DB-OTO works: the gene therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the OTOF gene into the cochlea, restoring a key protein (otoferlin) needed for hearing. In children with otoferlin-related hearing loss, their inner ear cells detect sound but can’t send signals to the brain due to a faulty gene. By injecting DB-OTO directly into the cochlea, the therapy enables these cells to produce otoferlin, re-establishing sound transmission and allowing children born deaf to hear. Voilà!</p><p>Overall the trial not only met but exceeded expectations. Ten of eleven children in the trial experienced significant improvements in hearing.

Loyal still needs the FDA’s final approval before it hits the market, but the company is still targeting late 2025 availability. The drug, called LOY-002, will be offered to senior dogs of all sizes (or at least &gt;14 lbs). Importantly, Loyal’s previous programs focused on older, larger dogs and wasn’t available to smaller and medium sized pooches.</p><p>While Loyal can’t really yet make claims on lifespan extension, it does comp the drug to a previous study from Purina on caloric restriction that extended dogs lives 2 years. Dogs can’t be on caloric restriction forever, that’s not sustainable, but taking a beef-flavored LOY-002 drug may be scalable to millions of dogs.</p><p>Extending the lives of millions of dogs is a good thing. Achieve that and Loyal is not only a valuable company, but likely a very loved company. But the company’s ambitions don’t stop at dogs. It wants to build on its learnings in creating canine longevity programs to build human longevity programs. And if they achieve that before others, Loyal is likely one of the most valuable and important companies in the world.

Donald Trump’s election, a pandemic that shut down the world, chainsawing through the Federal government, spiraling housing costs, a hot land war in Europe, the destruction of Gaza, the emptying of our downtowns: truly </span><em>anything  </em><span>can happen. </span></p><p>But when individual people look around at the mechanisms for democratic control of their lives… they  find that that the levers of power have melted away. Nothing can be done. The international systems of finance, trade, and production reside in a different dimension from political action. The big fights in cities might seem like they are with a mayor or a developer or someone with a different view on apartment buildings, but the underlying structures are controlled from and for elsewhere. </p><p>It’s kind of like the big newspapers. Yes, sure, there are union fights to be had, editorial conflicts to be resolve, etc. But the heart of the whole enterprise has been scooped out by forces far beyond any single paper. The social project of the news now lives and dies via private equity or billionaire ownership. </p><p>And so it is—with varying details—with so much of American life. My book looks at how and why we got to where we are. Specifically, it details how the development of global supply chains, working with a rising Silicon Valley, created a new and more distant power structure, what I call “the Pacific Circuit.” That trans-oceanic system fed dollars into our increasingly financialized economy, juicing the mortgage boom (and eventual bust) as well as the unbridled rise of venture-backed technology companies. My microcosm is the neighborhood of West Oakland, right up against the Port, and once the stronghold of the Black Panthers. </p><p>People in Oakland saw some of these changes coming. I draw on Huey Newton’s early insights into “the technology question,” as he put it. Logistics makes it possible to produce products that we love through a system that we, more or less, hate. Nations, he also observed, don’t play the same role in the globalized, technologized system he called “intercommunalism.” These conditions would force many more people, he thought, to become subject to the conditions of the Black ghettoes that the nation created during and after the Great Migration: Precarious employment, poor health, terrible debt burdens, hostile governmental interventions. He wasn’t wrong. </p><p>The services and stores that are part of a healthy urban ecosystem have been hollowed out by tech companies. Rather than shopping from a network of trusted humans and local businesses, you have a pile of Amazon boxes and a slate of apps on your phone. That is to say:  logistics—born in World War II, containerized in Vietnam, and scaled up for the last 50 years—has gone inside all of us. We’re nodes in a network of flows of material, feeding production and distribution systems that are located far from where we actually live. </p><p><span>This has done some incredible things. We have access to </span><em>so many products </em><span>now at much lower prices. And I don’t want to minimize the pleasure people take in their stuff. Two, it’s created thick cultural, migratory, and economic bonds between the cities of the West Coast and different Asian countries. There’s a new and heretofore unseen demographic reality in places like the Bay Area. And I believe in the possibilities of that kind of cross-cultural ferment.</span></p><p>But man, the downsides. Our cities are in huge trouble for multiple reasons. Nowadays, cities are filled with wildly expensive assets we call homes. It’s almost impossible to keep a restaurant or retail store open. City governments have no idea how to house or even care for homeless people living in their cars or in tents. All the products have to get from Asia to Target and Walmart, and that happens through ports like the one in Oakland. Massive fleets of trucks grab boxes off ships and head for warehouses, and they pass through West Oakland. The neighborhood has long been a sacrificial landscape, a place that all levels of government intentionally polluted in an effort to crowd out the largely Black residents. While they’ve made remarkable progress on air quality, so much of the land there remains so badly polluted, it can’t be used. Much of it sits there now, empty and inducing despair. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/93e26c43-1db0-4a2e-bbd0-5f7c235a31a9?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74058526-11ef-4d09-b42b-d32a2ad3e435_5760x3840.heic\"></a></figure></div><p>The book centers the life of Margaret Gordon, a longtime activist and environmental justice leader in West Oakland, who has been working in the neighborhood for 35 years. At this moment, it’s worth considering that Ms. Margaret did not come up close to power. The Black women community leaders she learned from in Hunters Point (the Big 5) didn’t have access to the halls of power either. They couldn’t just participate in politics and expect good results. They had to create new political realities to have any chance to help the neighborhood. </p><p><span>So, who better to help everyone get a handle on liquid modernity than people who’ve always had to come from the outside and make the system respond to their demands?I ran into Ms. Margaret at a party a couple weeks ago, and I loved how mad she was about what’s happening in this country. Her impulse wasn’t to get sad or tune out, but to get in the trenches and fight. She was </span><em>fired</em><span> </span><em>up</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>There’s only one Ms. M, but many environmental justice leaders share this orientation. I don’t always have that same first impulse to go to the barricades. I sometimes think the movement is </span><em>too </em><span>oppositional instead of trying to build new opportunities. </span></p><p>But at a time when so much is being dismantled, don’t you want to learn from the tactical experts on slowing down the bad things? (There is a reason that the Trump administration immediately targeted environmental justice players inside and outside the government.)</p><p><span>I also believe in the core idea of environmental justice. EJ is a way to reckon with the physical aftereffects of racist practices in this country. Right wing forces can try to hide the history of segregation or redlining or police brutality, </span><em>but</em><span> the land in historically Black neighborhoods keeps the score. There is the lead in the soil. There are the toxics buried in the empty lots. These environmental realities haunt these neighborhoods and no amount of intentional forgetting or obfuscation can make the heavy metals and solvents go away. </span></p><p>There’s a lot more to talk about in this book from the Third World Liberation Front to the proposed coal export terminal in West Oakland to the model of longshore unionism to the way that Silicon Valley’s semiconductor companies led the way on outsourcing to Asia. I’ll address some of those things here in the newsletter over time. (A microseason of book content, perhaps.)</p><p>I believe Oakland — concentrating as it does, the good and bad of this country — can give us a view into the future. We’re part of a long struggle for democracy, for multiracial democracy, for fairness in labor, for environmental justice, for state capacity that serves the people, for transnational solidarities. </p><p>Sometimes, I am floored that fascism has risen again, that Elon Musk and Steve Bannon have both thrown Nazi salutes with no discernible consequences, that eugenicists are targeting disabled people, that bigots are trying to erase our trans community. </p><p>But then I remember that the forces of resistance have a long history, too. This book, I hope, honors those who came before me here on this land. And I hope their stories inspire us for our turn in the conflict. I think some new coalitions may emerge from this current moment, and I would not be at all surprised if they are guided by the radical frequencies of Oakland. </p><div><div><div><p>oakland garden club is a reader-supported publication.

We’re happy to have Adam here as we dedicate more time and effort in ‘25 to the lower and middle markets than we traditionally have. Let’s dive in. </span></p><p><strong>PETITION: Thanks for doing this, Adam. Let’s start at a higher level, tell us about yourself and Force 10. What was the impetus for you and your co-founders to leave your prior gigs and found the firm back in ‘16? What opportunities did you see that weren’t being served by the market:</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>Thanks for inviting me to \"appear.\" I apologize in advance if I go off on a tangent, get too wonky, or lose focus. After answering everything, I realized my professional life had come full circle when discussing LMEs and private credit. That was fun.</em></p><p><em>I appreciate this question about my background and Force 10. I will get our advertising out of the way and be done with it.</em></p><p><em><span>I started as an investment banker at </span><strong>Jefferies</strong><span> and </span><strong>CIBC</strong><span>, primarily working on high-yield deals in the energy sector. The industry's cyclical nature meant I got thrown into restructurings early, and that work stuck with me. My first few years were a blur—living at the printers, cranking out adjusted (as if) EBITDA calcs, hunting for misplaced commas in indentures (before and after Plain English), battling sleep deprivation, and surviving on M&amp;Ms. It was intense, but I learned a ton.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I found my way back into restructuring through </span><strong>XRoads</strong><span>, working on a distressed cruise line. Later, at </span><strong>GlassRatner</strong><span>, I focused on lower-middle-market cases and kept running into the same problem. These companies were dealing with complex restructurings but couldn't access the right resources or advisors.</span></em></p><p><em><span>That led me to team up with my close friend </span><strong>Nicholas Rubin</strong><span>. We built a solid practice together, but eventually, we saw an opportunity to do something on our own. We left with one junior colleague and joined forces with </span><strong>Brian Weiss,</strong><span> a go-to restructuring guy in Southern California. We hit the ground running and launched Force 10.</span></em></p><p><em>The lower middle market comes with unique challenges—funded debt, and operational issues are part of it. However, litigation, governance breakdowns, and fraud often play a more significant role than people expect. That's why we built Force 10 to work differently and address it. Our firm comprises ex-ibankers, ex-bankruptcy attorneys, CPAs, and FP&amp;A types. We keep teams lean—just 2-5 people per case—and often serve as both restructuring advisor and investment banker. Many of our cases use Chapter 11 to untangle multi-party disputes, and we've developed a niche in investment fund restructurings, stepping in when fraud or mismanagement blows things up.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: One area that has been active lately in the lower to middle market is the restaurant space. Your firm worked as financial advisor and CRO to both the BurgerFi and Rubio’s Coastal Grill chains. In both instances, y’all had to run quick sale processes and, in the end, both chains – or what was left of them after closures of underperforming locations – were sold to TREW Capital Management. Talk to us about the restaurant space. What are some industry-specific challenges that you and your team have seen in these matters? And give us a prediction about the space to come? Do you see an uptick in activity and where/when? What are the catalysts?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>Restaurant bankruptcies tend to follow familiar patterns—rising costs (labor, food, rent), declining dine-in traffic, and third-party delivery squeezing margins. Chapter 11 can help shed underperforming locations, but the question remains: can the brand drive traffic without destroying margins? And does the balance sheet allow enough time to execute?</em></p><p><em><span>Full-service dining continues to struggle as more consumers prioritize grocery spending. Third-party delivery now accounts for ~20% of food sales but erodes profitability. Chains are locked in a race to the bottom, using aggressive discounting to lure customers but sacrificing margins. Even </span><strong>McDonald's Corp’s ($MCD)</strong><span> $5 meal deal barely moved the needle. Promotions can drive short-term traffic, but they won't fix a broken balance sheet — ask </span><strong>Red Lobster</strong><span>, which learned the hard way with its Ultimate Endless Shrimp fiasco.</span></em></p><p><em><span>But there are bright spots. </span><strong>Chili's</strong><span> engineered a successful turnaround with its Triple Dipper and Three For Me promotions, boosting traffic by 20% and same-store sales by 30%. Its owner </span><strong>Brinker International Inc. ($EAT)</strong><span> is happy. I didn't rush in for this deal: my tastes lean toward potato skins and mozzarella sticks. I checked, and Chili's doesn't have loaded potato skins, but someone started a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/908b26d8-fbf6-4cbb-bd4c-50dce55ff05e?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">petition</a><span>. </span><strong>TGIF</strong><span> could've used my nostalgia before it filed.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Beyond short-term sales trends, more profound structural shifts are at play. The rise of GLP-1s is already impacting packaged food and could hit restaurant traffic, especially for legacy brands catering to older demographics. Alcohol sales — a key profit driver — are also declining as younger consumers drink less. Over-saturation is another issue: there are too many restaurants, and too many fail to stand out. Younger diners prioritize experiences and fresh concepts over legacy brands. That's why concepts like </span><strong>CAVA Group Inc. ($CAVA)</strong><span> thrive (stock up 96% TTM) while others struggle to stay relevant. Even </span><strong>Chipotle</strong><span> </span><strong>Mexican Grill Inc. ($CMG)</strong><span> employees get tired of their own. I see them ordering </span><strong>Mendocino Farms</strong><span> to their social media studios in our office building.</span></em></p><p><em>And the pressure isn't easing. We may return to an inflationary cycle, further squeezing restaurant margins. Consumers have already signaled they won't tolerate another round of price hikes, forcing brands to find new ways to stay profitable. That's a tall order when costs keep climbing, traffic is shifting, and legacy brands struggle to remain relevant.</em></p><p><em><span>Restaurant restructurings aren't slowing down, particularly in casual dining and franchise-heavy brands. Distressed investors are circling, looking for the next trade. TREW bought the debt in BurgerFi right before the filing, only to flip it to the </span><strong>Savvy Sliders</strong><span>/</span><strong>Happy's Pizza</strong><span> group weeks later. More deals like this are coming. Google for a list of who's next.</span></em></p><p><strong>PETITION: The team seems nimble, taking on both company-side and creditor engagements. With respect to the latter, we noticed that your team tackled the representation of the official committee of unsecured creditors in the Cano Health matter early last year. We’ve obviously seen a lot of bankruptcies come out of physician practice roll-ups. What’s your take on that case and the wave of roll-up bankruptcies generally?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>Force 10 was briefly in Cano before that engagement team left to form their firm and focus solely on committee work. About 50% of our practice is healthcare, and the industry issues facing Cano are widespread, so I’m happy to discuss them. Beyond Cano, we’ve worked on other physician practice roll-ups, rural and urban hospital systems, urgent care, surgery centers, skilled nursing, long-term acute care, assisted living, and behavioral health.</em></p><p><em>Physician roll-ups are failing due to unrealistic financial assumptions, particularly regarding valuation. Many sponsors overpaid, assuming they could achieve cost synergies through centralization and secure higher reimbursement rates with insurers — neither of which occurred. Meanwhile, Medicare reimbursement has declined by approximately 30% in real terms, driven by five consecutive years of conversion factor cuts. At the same time, budget neutrality rules have further reduced specialty payments to offset increases for primary care. Adding to the pressure, the No Surprises Act has restricted out-of-network billing and lowered payments for out-of-network services, undermining aggressive revenue models. As a result, procedural groups are facing shrinking revenue while labor costs continue to rise.</em></p><p><em>Private equity’s debt-heavy model faces a refinancing crunch, with ~$12b in healthcare-related sponsor-backed debt maturing in ‘25. Potentially rising interest rates and tight margins increase the risk of covenant breaches and financial distress, so more healthcare bankruptcies are inevitable.</em></p><p><em><span>Programming note: There are new sheriffs in town — </span><strong>RFK Jr.</strong><span> and </span><strong>Dr. Oz</strong><span>. What they’ll do (or be told to do) with CMS and reimbursement is anyone’s guess. We've already started to see some chaos and budget cuts.</span></em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Retail has also been a real hot spot for bankruptcy lately. You’ve got some battle scars yourself from the industry. Tell us about Tuesday Morning. If memory serves, that was one of the uglier retail bankruptcies with all kinds of shenanigans. Do tell. Did you walk away with any big lessons from that one?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em><span>Tuesday Morning was a doozy. We were brought in as replacement FA on the eve of filing. The original plan was to wind down operations and liquidate. Still, </span><strong>Invictus</strong><span> and management believed they could deliver more to creditors via a 363 sale with Invictus set up as the DIP lender and intentions to be the stalking horse. Once we got involved, we realized not everyone was on board. We inherited the Invictus DIP loan situation, including the priming fight with </span><strong>Wells Fargo</strong><span> and </span><strong>Gordon Brothers</strong><span>. Although we prevailed on the interim priming issues, the problem with Invictus was twofold — Invictus didn't live up to their lending commitments and didn't submit the stalking horse bid they committed to providing during the first days. We returned to the pre-petition lenders for cash and ended up with two DIPs — a first for me — fighting over collateral. It just turned into a big ball of expensive twine. When we finally got to the auction, Invictus intended to credit bid their DIP loan plus cash in a 363 sale, but once again, they couldn't show convincing evidence of their ability to perform, so we went with </span><strong>Hilco</strong><span>. It still wasn't over. We fought over highest and best too. Ultimately, Hilco's deal was ordered, and they did a very professional job taking control of fleet operations while we wound down corporate. We wanted Invictus to show us the money because they intended to operate most of the locations after we culled out the bad stores (for the second time — it was also a 22), but they couldn't.</span></em></p><p><em>Still left with the inter-creditor and other contentious issues, we ultimately reached a global settlement and converted the case. That was about two years ago, and we are still providing the Chapter 7 trustee with information.</em></p><p><em><span>The Invictus litigation train kept rolling. Invictus and their LPs, unsatisfied with Tuesday Morning's outcomes and another case (</span><strong>DeCurtis</strong><span>), took their grievances to Chancery Court. I've since lost interest and need to check back in. Someone reading this will email me an update if they get this far.</span></em></p><p><em>Do I hear someone cranking Steve Miller's Band?</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b15d45b8-5330-493a-8fc3-acabbd5d4261?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_500,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1034e1d6-bcde-43f6-ac17-cf5add8e7c88_500x280.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>As for Tuesday Morning, the writing was on the wall from the get-go.

Any good war stories you can share from those experiences? The juicier, the better.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>Truthfully, I always dread it, but the stress of it forces me to dig in deep, and I think about my positions and what I am up against every minute until it's over. Once it's over, I am usually very pleased. I see many expert gigs as training for and participating in a triathlon with the runner’s high at the end.

We then worked closely with the Trustee, supporting fraudulent transfer actions and other litigation.</em></p><p><em>The Stormy Daniels-Trump case files remain on a server in our office, and we've provided discovery to several three-letter agencies.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Changing it up, to put it lightly, it’s hard not to notice the current and looming trade wars the new administration has been instigating with historic US allies. You know, Canada, Mexico, Western Europe. Plus China’s in the mix. No doubt there’s going to be mostly bad news across the board and we’ll all be enjoying marginally less avocado toast for the foreseeable future, but any particular industries you’d peg to experience higher levels of distress? Of them, which is your pick to experience the most in ‘25? What kinds of calls are you getting on this?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>Who knows what underlies this administration's tariff policy and its true objectives. Assuming the administration sees tariffs through, the homebuilding industry could be in for a rough ride. With the administration threatening to roll out 10-25%+ tariffs (it changes every day) on key construction materials — lumber, gypsum, steel, and aluminum from Canada, Mexico, and China — builders are bracing for higher costs at a time when affordability is already a significant challenge. While it's still early, they will push up construction costs if these tariffs stick. That's significant, especially considering the market already has a shortage of around six million homes and a 40% price increase since ‘20.</em></p><p><em><span>Builders are already managing tight margins, so they'll either have to absorb the higher expenses, pass them along to buyers, or cut back on projects altogether. If affordability worsens and demand slows, that will pressure the industry. Labor challenges could compound the problem. The construction industry depends heavily on immigrant labor, and many are undocumented. If </span><strong>Tom Homan</strong><span> has his way, workforce shortages will delay projects and increase costs.

Anything poised to throw more spanners into the works than the sky-high tariffs?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em><span>I will put on my tin foil hat here and discuss how Project 2025 could benefit RX professionals. Project 2025 could create new opportunities for us by shifting the resolution of failing financial institutions away from government-controlled processes and into the judicial system. A key policy goal of Project 2025 is the repeal of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) — a mechanism established under the Dodd-Frank Act that allows federal regulators, specifically the </span><strong>FDIC</strong><span>, to step in and wind down systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) when their failure poses a risk to the broader economy. The rationale behind OLA is to provide a structured, government-managed liquidation process that prevents chaotic collapses, avoiding a repeat of the ‘08 financial crisis. However, Project 2025 sees OLA as a bailout tool that undermines market discipline by shielding large financial firms from the full consequences of insolvency. It advocates using Chapter 11 bankruptcy as the primary mechanism for financial firm restructurings, arguing that this will promote transparency, fairness, and accountability. To this end, Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum on the OLA during his first administration.</span></em></p><p><em>If Project 2025 succeeds in repealing OLA, the responsibility for unwinding large financial institutions could shift to the existing Chapter 11 process. Some have proposed modifications to Chapter 11, such as a new \"Chapter 14\" framework, to make it more effective for handling complex financial firms. I don’t think the OLA mechanism has been used yet, but you never know.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: What do you think is the next lower to middle market strategy we’ll start seeing bigger companies avail themselves of? For example, LMEs are all the rage now, but contrary to what big law firms and banks would have you believe, they’ve been a staple in the middle market and below for years and years.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>It's just a question of capital flexibility and avoiding many restructuring headaches. Private credit is now clearly at the big boy table for the benefit of large-cap issuers funding $500 million+ deals regularly, which is right in the wheelhouse of smaller high-yield issuances. In ‘24, nearly 30% of private credit transactions crossed $250mm. Mega-funds are soaking up capital, and investment banks are shifting their focus. Something like over $1.5T is expected to flow into private credit funds over the next four years and that's a lot of money to put to work. Naturally, those inflows will chase bigger deals and yield.</em></p><p><em>Private credit structures increasingly use tools like PIK toggles, delayed-draw term loans, and covenant-relief periods to help borrowers manage downturns without triggering defaults. Today, many private credit loans include PIK features and an increasing number of larger private credit deals have scrapped or neutered maintenance covenants in favor of high-yield-style incurrence tests. High-yield bonds followed a similar evolution in the 80s and 90s, as issuers and investors learned that avoiding technical defaults often maximized long-term recoveries.</em></p><p><em>One of the most significant advantages private credit offers is the unitranche loan. Instead of stacking senior and junior debt in different tranches like high-yield, unitranche financing rolls everything into one package. That's great for borrowers because it simplifies execution and is a huge plus in a restructuring scenario.

Could be legal, financial, or anything else.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam</strong><span>: </span><em>I will veer away from legal and 'deal' issues and discuss the core of restructuring success for a going concern. As financial advisors, we are paid to be laser-focused on projecting financial performance. Clients need to get back to basics — dig into fundamental financial analysis to determine which businesses or segments are profitable and generate returns above their cost of capital. Many great companies operate with rigorous financial discipline, but too many still rely on gut instinct and tradition, managing with napkin math and seat-of-the-pants decision-making. Companies must develop and adhere to a structured financial analysis framework.</em></p><p><em>We all grew up using spreadsheets, but they promote garbage in and garbage out.</em></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fa336f3a-3e89-4590-b5b8-d8d987f688e6?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f5db8bb-65ee-42e8-8045-86fab2ecfc1f_908x511.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Photo Source: Adam Meislik</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Running deep scenario modeling and probability analysis required expensive, specialized software that most lower-middle market companies couldn't access or understand. Complex financial analysis is becoming more understandable and accessible through Python and generative AI (now both built into Excel). Companies can leverage Monte Carlo simulations and probabilistic forecasting tools to stress-test projections beyond static outcomes. Too often, financial forecasts become gospel when they should be seen as a range of possible outcomes with optimal strategies based on probability-weighted scenarios. Feasibility standards like \"more likely than not\" are too broad — they only test a single result. Simply put, too many of our assumptions are priced to perfection. If we started viewing financial forecasts as probabilistic ranges instead of certainties, we could likely avoid many cash collateral defaults, post-LMEs, and Chapter 22s.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Finally, we have a lot of smart readers in the earlier stages of their careers.

Initially developed for gambling and investing, it helps determine how much capital to allocate to a given \"bet\" — investment or divestment — by balancing probability and potential return. Beyond investing, the Kelly Criterion can also be applied to financial forecasting, helping to model optimal capital deployment and risk-adjusted growth strategies. In restructuring, this means prioritizing high-risk-adjusted return investments while maintaining liquidity.</em></p><p><em>Similar to my last response, my advice to the kids is to learn how to measure risk and allocate capital, dig deep into Python, and leverage generative AI (beyond creative writing) to let them focus on high-value-added work. Sorry if this sounds like “The Weave.”</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Thank you, Adam.

He had previously suffered from a rare inherited retinal dystrophy for over a decade but experienced significant improvement within weeks of treatment. The procedure involves injecting a modified virus carrying a functional copy of the faulty gene into the retina </span><em>(which doesn’t sound super pleasant tbh)</em><span>, enabling cells to produce the missing enzyme needed for vision.

The child's mother took Risdiplam, a gene-modifying drug, during the final six weeks of pregnancy, and the child has continued treatment post-birth. Now nearly three years old, the child shows no signs of the disease, which is unprecedented for cases this severe. Hell yeah!</p><p><span>This breakthrough suggests that early, in-utero intervention could significantly improve outcomes for SMA, which remains a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The idea originated from the parents </span><em>(talk about being good parents!)</em><span>, who had lost a previous child to the disease, and the FDA approved the treatment for this one case </span><em>(go…FDA?)</em><span>. This is a one-of-one case, but if replicated, this approach could shift how we treat diseases before birth.</span></p><p><em>From Arc Institute</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation—from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants—without task-specific finetuning.

A </span><strong>topological qubit</strong><span> is a special kind of qubit that stores information in the way certain particles move and interact, making it much more stable and resistant to errors than regular qubits. There’s that error reduction bit again. Any time you read about advancements in quantum computing, it generally is about some novel way of error reduction. </span></p><p><span>So what exactly did Microsoft do? The team developed a device that can measure the state of special particles called </span><em>Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs)</em><span>. MZMs are special quantum particles that act as their own antimatter and can store quantum information in a way that makes them resistant to errors. Using a superconducting nanowire and quantum capacitance measurements, they detected these states quickly and with high accuracy—making errors only 1% of the time. The measured states remained stable for over a millisecond, long enough to be useful for computation. </span></p><p>Anyway you cut it, this research is a pretty big advancement on the road towards useful quantum computing. That said, there is still some skepticism around whether the observed signals truly come from MZMs in a topological phase or from more conventional quantum states that mimic their behavior. Without that definitive proof that these are genuine MZMs, it’s still a breakthrough but the path towards scalable useful quantum is way less clear.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went on Dwarkesh to talk about his company’s quantum breakthrough, AI video game creation, and path to smarter and smarter machines. </p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c0603fd6-3a7f-469d-adb4-37935d469acc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/4GLSzuYXh6w\"></a><p>The whole thing is worth a watch, but the part we agree with most is Satya’s assertion that you shouldn’t believe AGI is here when any lab tells you it is, but when GPD starts growing at 10% a year.

After leading the way in enterprise databases and integrated software for years, competing fiercely for market share, Oracle missed three successive waves in computing: the internet, mobile, and finally, the cloud.</p><p><span>While Oracle was able to continue earning money from its extensive enterprise and government contracts which were locked in for years, and was able to hang on to relevance by using its distributional advantage with its existing customers to ship Oracle versions of emerging platforms and software, by 2016 things</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/97c1f2f6-6d58-4317-b9ce-9b7ec9e7afd0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"> looked pretty grim</a><span>. Oracle had ceded much of cloud to AWS, and Microsoft had started to muscle in with its own customer relationships to Fortune 500s and governments.</span></p><p>While still a titan, Oracle’s lack of innovation seemed to predict a steady slide into irrelevance. Yet over the last few years, the company has made a stunning comeback, somehow indispensable to the biggest players.</p><p><span>The straightforward business reason is that Oracle effectively positioned itself through massive investment in GPU datacenters to become one of the go-to players for training large language models, especially among its government and large enterprise customer base. The early miss on cloud also turned out to be an advantage, as AWS, Microsoft, and Google chose Oracle as a neutral service provider to help run their AI-focused datacenters.</span><span>³</span></p><p>Given the enormous investments in AI being made across the board, Oracle’s positioning has allowed it to capture a lot of value doing what it does best; large, long-term sales and services contracts with big players. The 90’s are back.</p><p>But the straightforward business reason is narratively boring. Instead, it’s much more interesting to understand Oracle as an extension of Larry Ellison’s will.</p><p>So who is Larry Ellison? Despite increasing public interest (for various reasons) in the emerging class of powerful tech billionaires, Lawrence Joseph Ellison seems to remain relatively quiet. Reportedly a close friend and mentor to Elon Musk, the 80 year old Ellison has led a colorful life, though has lately stayed out of the media spotlight.</p><p><span>To the extent that Oracle is an extension of Ellison’s will, Oracle’s fortunes reflect his leadership. My favorite history of the company, “</span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/346592a9-8a71-4560-a4db-cb858ad85ddb?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Softwar</a></em><span>”, gives the impression that the lifecycle of Oracle has gone as follows:</span></p><ol><li><p>Larry Ellison has an insight which leads to a breakthrough initiative which has the potential to reposition Oracle to the forefront of the industry, completely bypassing the competition.</p></li><li><p>It works.</p></li><li><p>Larry Ellison checks out to go sailing or play tennis or something for like a year.</p></li><li><p><span>Oracle gets into trouble. New entrants and existing competitors are eating away at its market share, and Oracle is losing head-to-head.</span><span>⁴</span></p></li><li><p>GOTO 1.</p></li></ol><p>For example, in the early 90s, Oracle faced stiff competition from several fast-growing software companies. At the time, enterprise software was heavily customized by the end-user, and third party integrators who would munge together several ‘best of breed’ packages to create frankenstinian hodge-podges of software, one solution per organizational function or process. It was a nightmare for everyone but the vendors and integrators, who made money either way.</p><p><span>Rather than competing on features, or cost, or attempting to create more best-of-breed products, or pay ever fatter sales commissions which ate away margins, Ellison chose to tell his customers that they were </span><strong>doing it wrong</strong><span>.</span><span>⁵</span><span> Software shouldn’t be built to fit business processes, he said, business processes must adapt to software. Vertically integrated </span><em>platforms</em><span> were the future.</span><span>⁶</span></p><p><span>Getting everything from one vendor meant you didn’t need customization or integration, things would just work. Yes, it meant changing the way you were used to doing things, but that’s what it took to get the most out of software. It just so happened that the vendor investing the most into this vertical strategy was Oracle. The move to vertically integrated platforms locked in Oracle’s distributional advantage for another decade.</span><span>⁷</span><span> Between 1990 and 2001, Oracle’s revenue went from $196M to $10 billion.</span></p><p><span>Tacking before competitors may have come naturally to Ellison, a lifelong sailing enthusiast. In the 2010 America’s Cup, Oracle-sponsored </span><em>USA-17</em><span> defeated Swiss </span><em>Alinghi 5.</em><span> This gave the winning team the right to decide the class of boat for the 2013. Making an already expensive and dangerous sport far more expensive, and far more dangerous, Team Oracle chose wingsail catamarans, with hydrofoils.</span></p><p><span>These boats could literally sail faster than the wind. The change was far from incremental; sailing teams were pushed to their absolute limit in terms of cost and training. A crew member from Artemis Racing died during a training run.

Customers would have to figure out which were the ‘best parts’ — a Honda engine, a Ford transmission, a BMW chassis, GM electrical system — and buy them and try to assemble them into a working car.

Softwar, again: “If that was a stroke of luck for Oracle, what wasn’t was Ellison’s decision, to the horror of many colleagues and customers, to abandon all further development of client/server-based applications and concentrate the firm’s entire engineering effort on building for the new computing architecture of the Internet. While rivals in the apps business, such as the German powerhouse SAP and PeopleSoft, talked up the Internet and put a web front-end on some of their products, Ellison went much further. Oracle was the first established software firm to risk everything on the new paradigm. His rationale was simple: Oracle could never hope to be number one in enterprise applications as long as client/server prevailed—it was fated always to play second fiddle to SAP, whose strength in the enterprise apps market almost matched Oracle’s dominance in databases. By getting to the Internet first, assuming that the software could be made to work, Ellison would force Oracle’s competitors to become followers, gaining vital time-to-market over them.”</em></p></div></div><div><span>8</span><div><p><em><span>PM writes: We really should not be surprised at Ellison’s current comeback.

You may also recall that the debtors’ latest bankruptcy papers came in blazing hot — with fingers pointing at all kinds of culprits for their sad state of affairs. The 22 is due to the vendors, they said! And customers, they added!! And, finally, the lenders!!! At the first day hearing, we got a healthy dose of schtick coupled with an equally robust helping of conspiracy theory. Did the FILO Agent, </span><strong>1903P Loan Agent LLC</strong><span> (“1903 Agent”) and (one of) the FILO lenders, </span><strong>1903 Partners LLC</strong><span> (“1903,” together with 1903 Agent, the “1903 Parties”), squeeze the debtors with robust reserves (assisted, in large part by the ABL lenders) so that the FILO lenders could recover the FILO at par </span><em>and</em><span> an affiliate, </span><strong>Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC</strong><span> (“GBRP”), could get the cherry on top as stalking horse purchaser and liquidator (aided, in large part, by a truncated sale process)? Inquiring minds want to know? And by “inquiring minds” we mean not just the non-FILO term lenders due $153.4mm and on the verge of a big fat f*ckening (the “ad hoc group”), but also general unsecured creditors due over $130mm in payables (exclusive of rejection damages claims) and, like, 19,000(!) employees. </span></p><p>In our post-filing initiation we wrote, </p><pre><code><code>“…the [stalking horse] agreement would ensure the world ends up one “yarn and yarn accessories” purveyor lonelier.

Here is the ad hoc group: </p><pre><code><code>“The circumstances of this Chapter 22 filing in general, and the relief requested in the Motions specifically, are extraordinary.[] Just four months after the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, the FILO Agent – a Gordon Brothers affiliate – unilaterally imposed a reserve against the ABL/FILO borrowing base, citing unspecified business deterioration as the purported basis for imposition of the reserve. The notice was, in the Debtors’ own words, a “highly unusual and not customary or reasonable use of discretion” by the FILO Agent. The Debtors warned that the reserve would directly impact the Debtors’ liquidity position and potentially cause irreparable and permanent harm to their business. But Gordon Brothers (which is also an affiliate of a FILO Lender) did not relent. The Debtors’ admonition proved correct, and the coercive reserve ultimately forced the Debtors into an expedited fire sale to Gordon Brothers with illegal terms that dictate the ABL/FILO Lenders will be the only creditors likely to receive any recovery.”</code></code></pre><p>Yeeeeeeeeeeeah, not happy. Of course, a lot of the ad hoc group’s beef is better served fresh during an actual sale hearing rather than a bid procedures motion hearing but, whatevs, there were already shots fired. Still, for now, the best the ad hoc group could hope for was to extend the process to allow time to draw competitive bids, open up the possibility of a credit bid, and affect consultation rights throughout the sale process. </p><p>For their part, Mr. Adams and the UCC — which is made up of three landlords and six trade creditors — also shot back. After all, they’re offended; they don’t love how the debtors assigned them the blame; and they want the 1903 Parties and GBRP to know that they can go f*ck themselves. Per the UCC: </p><pre><code><code>“The Debtors emerged from their first bankruptcy on April 30, 2024, after implementing a prepackaged plan that restructured debt, but made no operational changes. Nine months later, the Debtors commenced these cases to implement a wholesale liquidation and seek this Court’s approval to do so in less than 30 days. The stalking horse bid from Gordon Brothers, an affiliate of FILO lender and agent 1903P, will result in the loss of 19,000 jobs, leave landlords for approximately 800 locations without a tenant, and leave hundreds of suppliers without a customer. The Debtors and their lenders take no blame for this devastating result. Instead, in their pleadings and at the first day hearing both seek to cast the blame on the vendors, owed over $100 million, that refused to ship goods. Having retained advisors one week ago, the Committee intends to test these allegations to determine the cause of this devastating collapse of this company.\r\n\r\nThe Debtors and the prepetition ABL and FILO Lenders orchestrated a timeline that deprives the Committee any opportunity to fulfill its statutory obligations to creditors. The Debtors enter bankruptcy with a bid from Gordon Brothers that will pay off the ABL and FILO Lenders in full, including Gordon Brothers affiliate 1903P. This payoff leaves nothing for unsecured creditors. Nothing for unsecured creditors because the bid includes not just inventory, but all potential litigation claims and avoidance actions, including preference claims against insiders and the Lenders themselves.”</code></code></pre><p>Well guess what folks, the 1903 Parties don’t like f*cking themselves. </p><p><span>In its response, the 1903 Agent pointed to the debtors’ own evidentiary record, which cited “</span><em>the prolonged impact of an excessively sluggish retail economy</em><span>” and “</span><em>inventory challenges</em><span>” as factors leading to the 22. They wrote: </span></p><pre><code><code>\"The Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group refuse to accept this reality and have instead sought to proffer an alternate narrative that would allow them to extract undue value from the ABL/FILO Lenders. They emphasize that the FILO Agent is affiliated with the same corporate group as the Stalking Horse Bidder, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLP (“GBRP”). But that observation is legally irrelevant, because this Court has repeatedly recognized there is nothing improper about affiliated lenders and liquidators working on the same cases.\"</code></code></pre><p><span>To support that last statement, the 1903 Agent cited two other horror show bankruptcies, </span><em>In re Brookstone Holdings Corp.</em><span> and </span><em>In re Christmas Tree Shops LLC</em><span>. 😬. They added: </span></p><pre><code><code>\"The Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group now speculate that the second bankruptcy was the result of a sinister plot by the FILO Agent to weaponize an availability reserve to drive the business into the arms of GBRP. The facts — including the sworn evidence submitted by the Debtors explaining the reasons for their dismal financial performance and the filing of these cases — bely their story. Indeed, the only reserve imposed by the FILO Agent (the “FILO Availability Reserve”) was based on the FILO Agent’s reasonable business judgment and pursuant to its Permitted Discretion[] under the express terms of the ABL/FILO Credit Agreement. The FILO Availability Reserve was a $10 million reserve implemented nearly half a year prior to the Petition Date, and was a fraction of the reserve that the FILO Agent could have established based on the substantial justifications cited to the Debtors in support of the reserve before it was actually implemented in September 2024. Months later, in December 2024, the ABL Agent exercised its own Permitted Discretion to impose two additional reserves of $30 million and $50 million.\"</code></code></pre><p><span>Hmmm, so the argument is kinda sorta that the 1903 Parties conspired with the ABL lenders </span><em>and</em><span> fellow FILO lender, </span><strong>Centerbridge Credit CS LP</strong><span> (which holds ~$75mm of the FILO), to set up a liquidator affiliate with some business? Curious, 🤔.***</span></p><pre><code><code>\"Contrary to the Committee’s assertion that the Debtors emerged from the Prior Bankruptcy Cases “poised for success,” almost immediately upon emergence from the Prior Bankruptcy Cases, the Debtors significantly underperformed relative to their business plan. In the months following their emergence, the Debtors missed sales and cash receipts forecasts on a weekly basis, failed to secure improved trade terms from vendors on the projected timeline, and suffered adverse conditions related to inventory levels and mix, which contributed to lagging sales. </code></code></pre><p>Repeat: a flawed construct. It gets better: </p><pre><code><code>For example, as of July 2024 month-end, the Debtors’ fiscal year to date adjusted EBITDA was $71.1 million below the level projected in their post-restructuring business plan ($-47.6 million actual, versus $23.6 million plan).[] The Debtors’ three-month year-over-year sales trend had decreased 9.9% and continued to trend downward.[] Contrary to the insinuations made by the Committee and the Ad Hoc Term Loan Group during depositions, the FILO Agent did not impose the FILO Availability Reserve solely because the Debtors habitually underperformed their never-ending amended business projections. Instead, this lower-than-expected financial performance impaired the net orderly liquidation value (“NOLV”) of the Debtors’ inventory, which significantly threatened the FILO Lenders’ recovery in a downside scenario.\" </code></code></pre><p>And even better: </p><pre><code><code>\"In addition, the FILO Agent soon uncovered irregularities with respect to the Debtors’ financial reporting. The FILO Agent conducted a physical inventory count at a sample set of the Debtors’ stores and determined that the Debtors had materially underestimated the ongoing level of inventory “shrink” (which refers to a negative discrepancy between the recorded amount of inventory and the actual amount on hand, caused by factors like theft, damage, or administrative errors).[] The Debtors calculated shrink at 1.4% using a historical percentage of sales method, while the result of the FILO Agent’s analysis concluded that actual shrink averaged approximately 2.7%.[]\"</code></code></pre><p>Damn.

If the FILO Borrowing Base is overstated by a certain amount and the FILO Lenders continue to lend against it, they are essentially lending “naked” (unsecured by collateral) on the overstated portion.\"</code></code></pre><p><span>“But wait, </span><strong>PETITION</strong><span>, isn’t this a lot of posturing that doesn’t necessary apply to the bidding procedures stage of these cases?” Why, yes, dearly astute readers, it is. And by the time of the hearing, the debtors had already made some progress assuaging many of the concerns that </span><em>were actually relevant</em><span> to the bid procedures motion. Indeed, the term lenders were barely even a factor at the big procedures hearing. That’s because, by then, GBRP had agreed to a new stalking horse agreement containing a framework that would (i) potentially deliver value to the ad hoc group — something that was, in case you couldn’t tell, kind of a big sticking point for the ad hoc group**** — and, (ii) continue to provide funding for a wind-down that would keep the cases administratively solvent.***** Per </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span>’s </span><strong>Jeff Michalik</strong><span>:****** </span></p><pre><code><code>“Not to bury the lede, the term lenders have not consented. So, we do still have some wood to chop there, but we believe that the stalking horse agreement in its current form maintains our path to further constructive settlement discussions.”</code></code></pre><p>In other words, the debtors were able to get the ad hoc group to back off on their objection to the bid procedures motion (but sale and cash collateral issues remain and the parties continue to negotiate). </p><p>Similarly, the UCC backed off on most of its objection to the bid procedures motion too.******* Why? The debtors agreed to extend (i) the sale time line by a week and (ii) the UCC’s challenge period to 10 days past the sale hearing with an outside date of March 7, 2025. </p><p>But this left one big issue as far as the UCC was concerned. The big procedures still included 1903 Agent, in its agent capacity, as a consultation party.******** Which basically means that it would have a direct say over any potential bids that compete with its affiliate, GBRP. Judge Goldblatt wasn’t having it: </p><pre><code><code>“I start with the proposition that you're either a buyer or a seller. You're not both. And so I understand the notion that the FILO lenders should participate as a consultation party. But the notion that we're here with a FILO lender who's the agent who is also an affiliate of the buyer is a problem of their own making. And I don't want to prejudice the rights of other holders, but isn't there a solution in which another FILO holder serves as the consultation party?”</code></code></pre><p>He continued: </p><pre><code><code>“…during an auction, there are strategic conversations about how to maximize value and how to bring in more. And the notion that someone who's an affiliate of one of the buyers is in the room when you're having those conversations feels funky to me. And there seems to be a readily available solution.”</code></code></pre><p>That solution? Centerbridge.********* </p><p>With that understanding and notwithstanding a trio of UST objections, Judge Goldblatt approved the bidding procedures motion with what remained a rather aggressive timeline:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bfe9da10-1e0a-4f4c-a7f2-7c9fedb99359?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae49bcef-2d10-45f3-b720-44de610fb25c_638x383.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Dkt. 446-1</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>We’ll obviously know soon enough — </span><em>like maybe even literally today</em><span> — whether anyone will challenge GBRP for (what’s left of) these assets.**********</span></p><h5>*The cash collateral motion, you’ll note, is also referenced in the objections but that has been kicked for an undetermined day in the future. </h5><h5>**The UST nevertheless objected but saw its objection overruled. </h5><h5>***We should note here that the debtors’ proposed investment banker, Ryan Kielty at Centerview Partners, testified that the GBRP was market tested at the outset of the sale and marketing process. Three liquidators submitted bids for the debtors’ assets, but GBRP provided the highest guaranteed cash proceeds to the estates for all the debtors’ assets. The competition offered guarantees that were over $70mm lower and they were incomplete bids: one was for just inventory, PP&amp;E and IP, while the other was just for inventory. </h5><h5><span>****Mr. Kielty testified that one improvement to the GBRP bid is that the term lenders will stand to benefit from 35% of the liquidation proceeds raised “</span><em>…in excess of the cash that Gordon Brothers has outlaid to fund the purchase price, to fund the operating expenses of the liquidation, and then a series of liquidator agent fees on each of the asset categories that they're going to be working to liquidate.</em><span>” Sounds like quite the hurdle. </span></h5><h5>*****Speaking of “administrative solvency,” Centerview dropped their retention application on the docket on February 18, 2025 and they’ll clip $175k/month (so already $350k) plus $5.5mm as a “transaction fee” even though the “transaction” here is, absent some miracle, a handover to the 1903 Parties followed by a plan of liquidation. Not too shabby for two-to-three months of work. They were retained on December 9, 2024. </h5><h5>******Pressure to deliver on the green sweater apparently proved to be too much. </h5><h5>*******Other big issues obviously remain, however, including the fact that the current sale construct transfers (i) potential litigation claims against GBRP to GBRP and (ii) chapter 5 avoidance actions to GBRP in a case where general unsecured claims are set to get 🍩. </h5><h5>********The debtors indicated that they had no issue with 1903 as a consultation party because, presumably, as agent, 1903 owes fiduciary duties to other lenders, i.e., Centerbridge. Moreover, the debtors stated that the consultation rights were fine because 1903 was offering a cash bid rather than a credit bid — an argument that was, uh, confounding. Suffice it to say, Judge Goldblatt didn’t buy it. </h5><h5>*********Centerbridge is represented in these cases by Proskauer Rose LLP (Charles Dale, Adam Nowicki). </h5><h5>**********The debtors are shutting 100s of locations pursuant to the Court’s store closing sale order entered on February 14, 2025. Are you a gift card holder? You’ve got 14 days from the date of the order to use that sucker so get on it.

Sales of PCHI’s consumer products division also declined 24.8% in the same period, due partially to lower intercompany sales to PCHI’s retail division.”</code></code></pre><p>Uh oh. We’re reading that and looking back at that ABL/FILO component and, well, stop us if this sounds familiar: </p><pre><code><code>These factors placed significant pressure on the Company’s business and liquidity position. As a result, in September 2024, PCHI launched an effort to raise incremental capital to fund the Company’s business plan and navigate through a projected liquidity trough. A confluence of factors—all further described below—frustrated those efforts, leaving the Company with insufficient runway to effectuate its long-term growth strategy while maintaining the liquidity necessary to operate its business. Among other things, the Company’s efforts to obtain additional capital from either the ABL/FILO Lenders (as defined herein), the holders of the Company’s Second Lien Notes (who are also PCHI’s majority owners), and third-party strategic investors and lenders were unavailing. After the ABL Agent (as defined herein) instituted a $50 million discretionary reserve under the ABL/FILO Facilities (as defined herein), on December 10, 2024, PCHI found itself in default thereunder. Without any prospect for incremental capital or a liquidity infusion from the Company’s existing lenders or investors, PCHI was compelled to pivot to a liquidation strategy, to be effected through chapter 11.</code></code></pre><p>LOL, you mean to tell us that the ad hoc noteholder group that’s already seen over a billion dollars of cold hard cash incinerated didn’t want to triple down?!?

A neutrino is a tiny, nearly invisible particle that passes through almost everything without interacting. The discovery was made when KM3NeT, still under construction, detected a muon—a secondary particle created by a neutrino hitting nearby rock or seawater—leaving a bright trail in the detector. This confirms that ultra-high-energy neutrinos exist and opens a new window into the most extreme environments in the universe.</p><p>Scientists believe this neutrino could have been generated by a powerful cosmic accelerator, such as a supermassive black hole or a gamma-ray burst, or it might be a rare \"cosmogenic\" neutrino linked to the Big Bang’s remnants. Or more simply put, scientists don’t yet know how this neutrino was generated. The finding challenges current models and suggests more undiscovered high-energy particles could be out there. As KM3NeT expands, researchers hope to pinpoint the neutrino’s origin and uncover new cosmic secrets.</p><p><em>Mira et al in Science</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Montoya Mira et al. designed a rapid, noninvasive assay based on a fluorescently labeled protease-sensitive peptide coupled to a magnetic nanosensor to detect protease activity from a small sample of blood.

The test, using nanosensors, identifies a cancer-associated protease with high accuracy, distinguishing PDAC from both healthy individuals and those with other pancreatic diseases. </p><p>In a study of 356 patients, the test showed 98% specificity and 73% sensitivity, with improved performance when combined with the existing CA 19-9 biomarker. As we’ve talked about before, early detection is the closest thing we have to a cure for cancer. And PAC-MANN’s ability to provide early detection of PDAC could mean significantly higher survival rates.</p><p><em>Denver Rayburn</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Today, we stand at another such moment. Intelligence, automation, and cheap abundant energy are converging to rewrite the economics of production. Beyond industrial or trade policy, something more profound is changing: the underlying cost physics of manufacturing (coined with inspiration from </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5e9aacbd-deff-4d27-873e-04cc88784a48?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Coogan’s Law</a><span>.)

Denver Rayburn, in this excellent primer, lays out his thinking on how America may be favorably positioned to take on that role once again.</p><p>Rayburn argues that the convergence of AI, automation, and cheap energy is permanently reshaping manufacturing economics and eliminating the labor cost arbitrage that drove manufacturing out of the U.S. in the first place. In a world where labor cost is no longer the primary input cost, a country that has abundant and cheap energy, the capital markets to finance an automation rollout, and is a leader in artificial intelligence finds itself in a very strong position. Thankfully, the U.S. checks all of those boxes.</p><p>It’s kind of scary to think how much of U.S. foreign and domestic policy really hinges on a) whether or not this transition is actually underway and b) how well positioned the U.S. is in this transition. Let’s hope Rayburn is right and that both the government and private sector take advantage of this unique opportunity in history to rebuild America as a manufacturing hub.</p><p><em>By Reuters</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Palmer Luckey-founded defense tech startup Anduril will take over the development and production of Microsoft's mixed-reality headset program for the U.S. Army, the companies said on Tuesday.

An AR/VR headset for the military…Palmer Luckey was born to win this contract.</p><p>Some specifics on the deal: Anduril is taking over production, hardware and software development, and delivery timelines for the program from Microsoft. Microsoft Azure will remain the preferred cloud provider for IVAS and Anduril’s AI-driven defense technologies.

Neutral atom quantum computing traps rubidium atoms with lasers and encodes quantum information in their electron energy levels, offering scalable and stable qubits without the need for extreme cooling. This approach has historically failed at precisely controlling atoms, but a 2019 breakthrough in laser-based techniques has significantly improved accuracy.</p><p>Practical quantum computing requires tens of thousands of qubits to reach utility, and we’re still a ways off from that. But with major companies like Google and IBM investing billions into R&amp;D and a wave of newly funded startups introducing novel architectures, the race for quantum is heating up. As neutral atom systems close the performance gap with more established technologies, competition in the field is shifting from feasibility to scalability, and QuEra’s funding signals growing confidence in this approach as a contender for the future of quantum computing.</p><p>Have a great weekend y’all.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c7fabeeb-924d-4427-b336-89a5ae933e1a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Ramp</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a5f29d98-5257-4897-9661-1127f2215d07?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Rox</a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b5a118be-adcc-41be-a875-69d09dd725f8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vanta</a></strong><span> for sponsoring!

This essay, like many, isn’t meant to provide an answer, but to share how I’m thinking through it in real-time. </p><p>As more knowledge workers spend their days prompting LLMs, it’s become popular to argue that asking good questions is becoming more valuable. What is less obvious but I think more interesting is that it will expose how little we actually care about answers, and in turn, what makes questions so valuable in the first place. </p><p>Let’s get to it. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/33c6322f-3a06-4ef6-8aba-5c3250f51f5a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2342383-5505-4955-a161-789f8b5da532_1200x600.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Writers all know a secret that I want to share with you, because whether you consider yourself a writer or not, you’re writing a story, too:</p><p><strong>Questions reshape your reality.</strong></p><p>We all think what we want is answers. We don’t, actually. Answers are dead things. Questions are animating. What we want is great questions.</p><p>By the time a question gets its answer, all of the juice has been squeezed. The answer is the pulp and pith. Answers are static things. Questions are kinetic. I like watching the NBA Draft more than I like watching any single NBA game. The Draft creates questions. Games are answers.</p><p><span>Actually, fuck answers, the more I think about it. The best questions don’t have answers. The point of the question isn’t to find </span><em>an </em><span>answer. The best questions are organizing principles, magnets, ways of seeing.</span></p><p>Writers know this. Staring at a blank page with no question to answer is felt proof of Sartre’s observation: “Humans are condemned to be free.” (Maybe it had to be a writer who made that observation.) Fire up a blank page with a question in mind, however, and the world becomes grownup Blue’s Clues. You’re reading something or talking to someone and it’s almost as if you see a blue paw print and hear little kids shouting “A clue! A clue!” whenever something you might be able to use appears.</p><p>What’s true in writing, I’m arguing, is true (maybe increasingly so) with life.</p><p>The most important question you can ask yourself, if you don’t know your question already, is “What question am I trying to answer?” Like with your life. This one actually should have, if not an answer, at least a working hypothesis. But since the answer is a question, we’ll let it slide.</p><p><span>Writers get to do this over and over again, each time we work on a new piece, </span><em>in silico</em><span>. If I am writing an essay on </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d7e813df-8338-4300-9378-1956a24f86fe?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">networking</a><span>, my brain tingles every time I come across some bit of information that might be useful to explaining networking. It is unbelievable to experience the first few times; tidbits I would have skimmed right over suppressing a yawn in normal times become engrossing when they help answer my question.</span></p><p><span>For a writer, though, each essay is a specific question in service, hopefully, of a larger question, and it’s that larger question that is relevant to even those of you who don’t consider yourself writers, because it’s about how you write the story of your life. This is the question that shapes you </span><em>in vivo</em><span>. The one that animates you.</span></p><p>This kind of question is like a mission, but with infinite paths – equally driving but endlessly explorable. A mission is almost too much like an answer, after which you autopilot in pursuit. A question branches. A mission is a wonderful thing, but more people have questions (and more of them).</p><p><span>Over the past few months, I’ve been obsessed with becoming a better writer. That is not my main question - </span><em>How can I become a better writer? </em><span>- but exists in service of it. Sub-questions are important, too, like side quests, and are made pointier by the existence of your Big Question. So I’ve tried to read a lot of great essays and profiles – David Foster Wallace’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4b70f309-3bb2-4929-a3f8-e0cb966ba200?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">David Lynch Keeps His Head</a></em><span> and </span><span>and Guy Talese’s </span><span>and Tad Friend’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8ca0a06b-0d5c-4b82-8e29-8e91a6bad2ae?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Mind of Marc Andreessen</a><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0cedc472-3aaf-49dc-a569-719ab1189ecd?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Sam Altman’s Manifest Destiny</a><span> </span></em><span>– and I’ve read some books on writing by the greats in the particular literary nonfiction form in which I want to write: John McPhee’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3e116291-3a5b-4174-b805-0bb1ed44565b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Draft No. 4</a></em><span> and Robert Caro’s </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d9cfaa09-8e06-446d-a90e-40f5e5fbabb1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Working</a></em><span> among them, the latter in which Caro, who you might recognize from </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/57dc3072-42a0-459b-b540-a32f442bc882?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Power Broker</a><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ea26e7e4-7cd1-415e-8ad9-a5396542578b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Years of Lyndon Johnson</a></em><span>, writes:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>One of the reasons I believed I had become an author in the first place was to find out how things really worked and to explain those workings, and, as my focus had narrowed to politics, that reason had become to explain how political power really worked. And during the few years I had been a reporter I had convinced myself, in part because of the easy gratifications that go with the journalist’s life–the bylines; the gratitude or the wary respect or fear that the subjects of your articles had for you; the awareness of friends or neighbors of what you were doing; the feeling that you were at the center of the action–that I was succeeding in doing what I had set out to do.</em></p><p><em>But the more I thought about Robert Moses’ career, the more I understood that I had been deluding myself.</em></p></blockquote><p>That is a question-haver right there.

And despite being warned by those around Robert Moses, the subject the only book that Caro wrote while broke, unknown, and powerless, that no one over whom Moses held any power (which was a lot of people) would speak with him about the book, and certainly Moses himself would not, Caro just spoke with whoever he could, even four layers removed from the man, until, eventually, Moses caved, impressed by the younger Robert’s doggedness: “ [Sidney M. Shapiro, Moses’ aide] had said that ‘RM,’ learning of my stubbornness despite his strictures, had concluded that at last someone had come along who was going to write the book whether he cooperated or not.” The book became </span></p><p><span>Caro asks plenty of specific questions, ones with specific answers, in </span><em>The Power Broker.</em><span> Exactly how much did Moses build? How did he physically shape New York City? How did Moses use Authorities as his source of power? What was his impact on people who lived in his way?</span></p><p>Each of these, though, was in service of the larger question of how political power really works. It’s this question that drove him to ask all of the others, even at great personal cost.</p><p><span>This question literally shaped his life, how he spent it during the months that turned into years writing </span><em>The Power Broker</em><span>, and how he would spend it afterwards, when he’d won a Pulitzer and could write about whatever he wanted. Caro had been planning on writing a biography on New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia – Caro lived in New York, and after writing about Moses, he </span><em>knew</em><span> New York – but he realized that if he really wanted to answer the question </span><em>How does political power really work in America?</em><span> he would need to study someone who shaped America on the national level. So he chose Lyndon B. Johnson, and he has been writing about power through the LBJ lens for over a half century since.</span></p><p>Do you see what I mean? The question shaped everything about him – where he and his wife Ina lived, what they read, who they spoke with, and the words he wrote.</p><p><em><strong>Nothing in Caro’s life would have been the same if he’d asked a different question.</strong></em></p><p>There is nothing unique, from that perspective at least, about Robert Caro. What is perhaps unique is that he found a question so powerful to him that he allowed it to fully shape his life. Had he chosen another question he cared about less, he presumably would not have let it dictate where he lived or how he’s spent every day for fifty-one years (and counting). He also wouldn’t be Robert Caro; I certainly wouldn’t be writing about him right now.</p><p>But I think that for most of us there exists a question that could impact each of us similarly, and I know that most of us have not spent nearly enough time asking what that question is.</p><p><span>Let’s test that: </span><strong>what’s your question?</strong></p><p>—</p><p><span>Often, almost as a way of catching my breath, I’ll feed what I’ve written to Claude and ask for feedback. I just did just that. After some specific suggestions, Claude wrote, “The piece is developing a compelling argument about how the right question can generate almost </span><strong>supernatural persistence</strong><span>.”</span></p><p>That is funny. I will explain why.</p><p>—</p><p><span>It’s Saturday morning (as I write this). I’ve been noodling this piece for a few days, and I put fingers to keys on it for the first time yesterday (Friday) afternoon. I went fingers up at around 5pm in order to get back and meet Puja and the kids for dinner near our house. It was a sharply cold but clear and beautiful afternoon, so I got off of the N at Atlantic and instead of transferring to the R for the last leg, I walked the 13 minutes to the restaurant. Since listening to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes, </em><span>I have been meditating every day, as I shared in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1f875c41-deb6-4773-b1a8-c57b7b62c2ba?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Return of Magic</a></em><span>.

So on my walk yesterday, looking up at the light, planes, and clouds, I asked the universe for a sign. This wasn’t nearly as weird or dramatic as it sounds, it was almost a throwaway thought as I was walking sans headphones with mental time to kill, and the dream scenario would have been a glowing orb or something but I didn’t actually expect that (or anything) to happen. But then I looked up and to my right and I saw this:</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f1a8c244-72e9-476e-8739-4552d429f164?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4868317-bfda-496f-b078-f47be5503270_1600x683.png\"></a></figure></div><p>That looks like a question mark, right?

Weird, at least. You gotta give me that.</span></p><p><span>So last night, another Friday night, this question of how to write about questions – about how questions are like more flexible missions – bumping around in my brain, I decided to shut my brain off and watch the new American Alchemy, this one with </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/912d257f-0ea2-42d1-ad11-3b50e8fd09cb?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Communion</a><span> </span></em><span>author Whitley Strieber.

That is the thesis of this essay: burning questions as motivating force and organizing principle. Remove the UFOs and Whitley is describing Robert Caro.</p><p>Does that seem like a synchronicity to you? At least a coincidence, right?</p><p><span>I mean, even if you’re skeptical, even if you think I’m fooling myself because I want to believe and that I just noticed “</span><strong>burning question</strong><span>” because I’m in the middle of asking questions about questions… AHA! Well that’s exactly the point I’m trying to make.</span></p><p><strong>The questions we ask reshape our reality.</strong></p><p><span>If I were not asking myself a question about questions, there is no way that, 2:04:20 into an interview at 9:45pm on a Friday - past my bedtime - I would have even registered that sentence. But since I </span><em>was</em><span> asking myself about questions, that sentence jumped right into my brain and, from there, sent tingles down my spine. A clue! A clue!</span></p><p><span>This is what questions do: they pull the right stuff into your brain. The late, great strategy professor Clayton Christensen </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4099ed78-2806-439f-bd90-0976e83f4d89?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">apparently told Jason Fried</a><span> (lightly paraphrased by Fried, emphasis mine):</span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Questions are places in your mind where answers fit</strong><span>. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question — you have to want to know — in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.</span><span>¹</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Your mind can’t fit everything. Questions filter out the things you don’t care to fit and find a place for the things you do. So having a question becomes more important in proportion to the amount of information available to you, which these days is way too much. A question keeps you from getting sucked into the algorithmic noise, and surfaces some signal at least when you inevitably occasionally do. Algorithms are braindamaging btw because they shoot at you a stream of answers you never asked for, answers with no right place to fit, like a wetware DDoS attack.</p><p><span>But questions do more than just filter; filtering is too passive a thing. </span><strong>Questions attract, drive, and distinguish.</strong></p><p><span>We talked a little bit about </span><strong>attracting</strong><span>. This is what happens to me when I’m writing a piece. Suddenly, I discover useful tidbits without even looking for them.</span></p><p><span>We talked about their </span><strong>driving</strong><span>, too. Asking a question doesn’t just make information appear. It pushes you to seek out any information that might help you get closer (asymptotically, never really getting there, because that’s when the fun ends) to an answer. This is the story of Robert Caro. This is why he waded through piss and feces in East Tremont and why he and Ina moved to Hill Country. Having a question that you truly want to answer gives you what </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5622b1ab-5c71-42bb-9839-7cf588f3c46d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Graham Duncan calls</a><span> a “hungry mind,” which he says, correctly, is very hard to fake. Questions are what send you in search of old out of print niche publications instead of scrolling the same garbage everyone else is. They’re what push you to uncover informational alpha – to call the person who knew the person who knew the person, in case they might have a nugget. We say curiosity is one of the most important traits in a person; </span><strong>questions are curiosity made tangible</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>We haven’t really talked about </span><strong>distinguishing</strong><span>, but having a question does that too.</span></p><p>I told you that in trying to become a better writer, I’ve been studying Caro, McPhee, and DFW. All three are masters of literary nonfiction, even if DFW would have identified more with his fiction. The three are entirely, completely different writers in a way that I never bothered to appreciate until I asked myself the question “How can I become a better writer?” in service of a bigger question I can feel but am still trying to pin down concretely. They are different writers because they ask different questions.</p><p><span>Caro asks: </span><strong>How does political power really work in America?</strong><span> and attempts to answer by studying just two Americans who wielded power most impactfully. Really, since 1965, sixty years ago, he’s written two books (one over four, soon to be five, volumes).</span></p><p><span>McPhee asks something entirely different! On the surface, it might look like he’s asking, “How do humans interact with and shape the natural world, and how does it shape us?\" or something. But I think he’s really asking </span><strong>\"How can words capture the full depth, structure, and texture of reality?\"</strong></p><p><span>Asking an entirely different question has created an entirely different life! Where Caro has produced two stories, McPhee has published 34 books and written more than 100 articles for </span><em>The New Yorker</em><span>. That is the output of someone who is working on the craft itself. What’s more, McPhee has been </span><em>teaching </em><span>writing at Princeton University since 1975.</span></p><p>Caro uses writing in service of his subject. McPhee uses subjects in service of his writing.</p><p><span>DFW asked a much different and more personally urgent question: </span><strong>“How can we live a meaningful, non-bullshitty life in a world increasingly full of irony, entertainment, and distraction?”</strong></p><p><span>His novels, like </span><em>Infinite Jest</em><span> and </span><em>The Pale King,</em><span> are long (long) explorations of the question; his profiles, like </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4b70f309-3bb2-4929-a3f8-e0cb966ba200?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">David Lynch Keeps His Head</a><span> </span></em><span>to </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1715b0c4-f073-47ce-84a1-63f167cafb36?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Roger Federer as a Religious Experience</a></em><span>, examine rare individuals, whose strangeness and mastery, respectively, suggest an answer.</span></p><p>Incidentally, in both of those essays, two of my favorites, DFW explicitly names the sub-question he plans to pursue in order to handle the particular subject in a way that others – others with different Big Questions than DFW, or with no Big Questions at all – would not.</p><p>In D.L.K.H.H., he writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>So the obvious \"Hollywood insider\"-type question w/r/t Lost Highway is whether the movie will rehabilitate Lynch's reputation. For me, though, a more interesting question ended up being whether David Lynch really gives a shit about whether his reputation is rehabilitated or not. The impression I get from rewatching his movies and from hanging around his latest production is that he really doesn't. This attitude-like Lynch himself, like his work-seems to me to be both grandly admirable and sort of nuts.</em></p></blockquote><p>In R.F.A.A.R.E., he actually names the idea we talked about earlier about answers not being that interesting…</p><blockquote><p><em><span>Journalistically speaking, there is no hot news to offer you about Roger Federer. He is, at 25, the best tennis player currently alive. Maybe the best ever. Bios and profiles abound. “60 Minutes” did a feature on him just last year. Anything you want to know about Mr. Roger N.M.I. Federer — his background, his home town of Basel, Switzerland, his parents’ sane and unexploitative support of his talent, his junior tennis career, his early problems with fragility and temper, his beloved junior coach, how that coach’s accidental death in 2002 both shattered and annealed Federer and helped make him what he now is, Federer’s 39 career singles titles, his eight Grand Slams, his unusually steady and mature commitment to the girlfriend who travels with him (which on the men’s tour is rare) and handles his affairs (which on the men’s tour is unheard of), his old-school stoicism and mental toughness and good sportsmanship and evident overall decency and thoughtfulness and charitable largess —</span><strong> it’s all just a Google search away. Knock yourself out.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>…before writing that what he wanted to write about was the transcendent </span><em>experience</em><span> of watching Federer play:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>This present article is more about a spectator’s experience of Federer, and its context. The specific thesis here is that if you’ve never seen the young man play live, and then do, in person, on the sacred grass of Wimbledon, through the literally withering heat and then wind and rain of the ’06 fortnight, then you are apt to have what one of the tournament’s press bus drivers describes as a “bloody near-religious experience.” It may be tempting, at first, to hear a phrase like this as just one more of the overheated tropes that people resort to to describe the feeling of Federer Moments. But the driver’s phrase turns out to be true — literally, for an instant ecstatically — </span><strong>though it takes some time and serious watching to see this truth emerge.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Understanding DFW’s Big Question, do you see why he asks the specific sub-questions he does in each of these profiles?</p><p><span>I guess the point here being that do you see what I mean w/r/t answers just not being that interesting and the questions you ask shaping your reality? No one else would write Federer like DFW did. McPhee, writing about a tennis match in one of </span><em>his </em><span>most famous essays, </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/68e797a6-0ee4-4d36-9196-21dbdf4c38b0?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Levels of the Game</a></em><span>, writes an entirely different piece!

It didn’t earn its word count. Having read too much DFW, however, I decided to put it here IYI.</p><p><span>Christensen was in the right place to make that observation. As a professor, he must have seen thousands of kids fumble the opportunity to learn from </span><em>THE CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN</em><span> because they were there to get a degree, not answer a question. One of my great regrets is not having had the questions I have now when I went to school, a magical place designed to let you explore all of them. One of my great joys is that my son Dev wants to build worlds and approaches almost everything through the lens of “Will this help me build a world?” I can </span><em>see</em><span> the question opening up places in his mind. My job now is to protect that question-led curiosity at all costs. But Christensen doubtlessly saw so many kids whose driving question was “Will this be on the test?” that the question-as-place insight became obvious.</span></p><p><span>As a </span><em>strategy</em><span> professor, he would have experienced the opposite: the value of asking the right question. A friend of Richard Rumelt, my other favorite strategy professor, once observed to him that “it looks to me as if there is really only one question you’re asking in each case: </span><strong>What’s going on here?</strong><span>” Rumelt writes that the observation was “instantly and obviously correct. A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.” Not just getting the answer, but the more fundamental problem of asking the right question.</span></p><p><span>I came across that Rumelt anecdote in Graham Duncan’s essay, </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5622b1ab-5c71-42bb-9839-7cf588f3c46d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">What’s going on here, with this human?</a></em><span>, which I re-read after listening to Graham’s fantastic conversation with Patrick O’Shaughnessy.</span></p><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png\"></div><img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ae1057a7870dd173346f5a2ea\"><p>Graham Duncan - Talent Whisperer - [Invest Like the Best, EP.409]</p><p>Colossus | Investing &amp; Business Podcasts</p><p>Episode</p><p><span>Patrick named the episode “</span><em>The Talent Whisperer,</em><span>”</span><em> </em><span>and what becomes clear throughout the conversation is that Graham has crafted a successful career and life by asking the question: “How do you see someone, including yourself, clearly?”</span></p><p>Graham has made an art of understanding people – Patrick introduced him by saying that his “reputation was as the most discerning people picker on Wall Street” – and in his essay, he writes that one of the best ways to do that is to see what kinds of questions they ask:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>It also helps to have the candidate you’re trying to see clearly ask you questions. Questions have very high signal value compared to most anything else you can get from a candidate… I write down each question and sometimes respond with “I’ll answer, but first I’m curious, why did you ask that?” </span><strong>I’m looking for the felt sense of a “hungry mind” based on the way their questions flow. That’s very hard to fake.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>I am picturing myself, many moons ago, in the last few minutes of many Wall Street interviews, the portion when they ask, “So what questions do you have for me?”, asking dumb questions like “What’s your favorite part about the culture at Deutsche Bank?” or something equally stupid because I didn’t actually care enough. I left finance a few years later when I realized that I had friends who </span><em>loved </em><span>finance, and that they would always beat me.</span></p><p>Another way of putting that, in the context of questions, is that they actually wanted to answer the question, “How do you pull money from the markets when so many other smart people are competing to do the same thing?” So when they got put in a room with someone who did that professionally, they asked hungrier specific questions in order to better answer their big question. As Graham wrote, it is very hard to fake what your mind is hungry for.</p><p>This is why it is so important to figure out the big question you’re trying to answer. Putting yourself in situations that feed your mind what it’s hungry for lets you outwork everyone else without even realizing you’re working. You’re just trying to answer your question!</p><p><span>Each person’s mind is hungry for different things (different nutritious things, at least), and each person’s big question will be different.
