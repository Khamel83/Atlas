          "description": "Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. Citi is a TPG advertising partner. \n\nCiti Premier® Card overview\n\nThe Citi Premier® Card is an under-the-radar gem with a phenomenal range of bonus categories. While the card isn’t as strong on the redemption side as similar offerings from Chase or Amex, the ability to earn 3 points per dollar on air travel, hotels, gas stations, supermarkets and restaurants (including takeout) for just $95 a year is still a pretty great deal. Card rating*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n* Card rating is based on the opinion of TPG’s editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.\n\nFor the past few months, the Citi Premier® Card has been offering a best-ever bonus of 80,000 points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months. That’s all coming to an end soon, though, so if you have been waiting to apply, now is the time to do so.\n\nBesides the intro bonus, there are plenty of reasons this card deserves a place in your wallet.\n\nFirst, the card is one of the best earners on everyday spending you can find. It accrues 3 points per dollar on air travel and hotels as well as at gas stations, restaurants and supermarket. Not bad for a card with a $95 annual fee.\n\nNot only that, but the points you earn with the Citi Premier are also among the most versatile rewards currencies out there, and worth 1.7 cents each by TPG valuations. That’s because Citi has improved the ThankYou Rewards program substantially over the years to compete with the likes of American Express Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards. So the 80,000-point sign-up bonus is worth $1,360 by our estimates.\n\nThe Citi ThankYou program now boasts a total of 16 airline transfer partners, including standouts like Avianca LifeMiles and JetBlue TrueBlue. The program also recently added two new hotel partners, Wyndham Rewards and Choice Privileges.\n\nHere’s what else folks should know about this card and why you should apply now while the current welcome offer is still available.\n\nWant more credit card news and advice from TPG? Sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nWho is this card for?\n\n(Photo by John Gribben for The Points Guy)\n\nThe Citi Premier accrues bonus points on gas stations, dining at restaurants, supermarkets, air travel and hotel purchases — one of the most prolific set of bonus categories we’ve seen offered on any card.\n\nThanks to various airline transfer partners (plus the recent addition of Choice Privileges and Wyndham Rewards), Citi ThankYou Rewards can be useful for consumers who value flexibility when it comes time to redeem their points for all kinds of different travel needs. In short, this is a solid mid-level travel credit card and a good option for folks who want to avoid premium cards with hefty annual fees but still earn valuable transferable points.\n\nThe Citi Premier is also an excellent choice for people looking to diversify their points-earning strategy away from Chase Ultimate Rewards and Amex Membership Rewards. In fact, this card gets much more compelling for people who’ve already maxed out their 5/24 slots with Chase, mainly thanks to its robust sign-up bonus…while it lasts.\n\nYou could also consider pairing the Premier with the Citi Custom Cash℠ Card, a no-annual-fee cash-back card that earns rewards through the Citi ThankYou points program. You can leverage the Custom Cash’s rewards rate of up to 5% back on your top eligible spending category each billing cycle (on up to the first $500 spent each billing cycle), then 1% on everything else. Combine it with the Citi Premier’s excellent rewards rate for everyday and travel purchases, and you’ve got a powerful card duo that can help you accumulate a large stash of ThankYou points in no time.\n\nRelated: The best Citi credit cards of 2021\n\nSign-up bonus and annual fee\n\nThe Citi Premier is currently offering a record-high 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening. Citi uses a rather interesting rule to determine bonus eligibility, though.\n\nYou won’t be able to earn the bonus on the Citi Premier if you’ve opened or closed the Citi Rewards+® Card, Citi ThankYou® Preferred*, Citi Premier or Citi Prestige® Card* in the last 24 months. Most issuers count that time solely based on when you opened a card or received a bonus, but with Citi, your clock also resets if you close a card, so it’s all in the timing.\n\n*The Citi ThankYou Preferred and Citi Prestige are no longer available for new applicants. The information for the Citi Prestige has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nThere’s a $95 annual fee on the Citi Premier.\n\nRelated: The ultimate guide to credit card application restrictions\n\nPerks\n\nUse your World Elite Mastercard benefits to book a room at the InterContinental Fiji. (Photo by JT Genter/The Points Guy)\n\nMuch of the Citi Premier’s value proposition comes from the fact that it offers the ability to earn bonus points in a slew of categories without charging a hefty annual fee. As such, you shouldn’t expect an overwhelming number of perks, but there are several benefits of this card that can help you recoup your annual fee:\n\n$100 annual hotel credit: You’ll enjoy a $100 credit once per calendar year for single-stay hotel bookings of $500 or more (excluding taxes and fees) made through thankyou.com.\n\nExtended warranty protection: Adds an additional 24 months to a manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nDamage and theft protection: Repairs or replaces an item that’s damaged or stolen within 90 days of purchase (up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 per year).\n\nWorld Elite Mastercard benefits: As a World Elite Mastercard, the Citi Premier confers several travel-related perks that consumers might not know about. These include a $5 monthly Lyft credit after taking three rides in a calendar month and access to the Mastercard luxury hotels and resorts portfolio for on-property perks like complimentary breakfast and room upgrades upon availability. Through the World Elite Mastercard program, you’ll also enjoy perks such as cellphone protection and Global Emergency Services.\n\nCiti® Entertainment: This program gets cardholders special access to purchase tickets to thousands of events — ranging from concerts and sporting events to unique dining experiences and movie screenings — before the general public can buy them.\n\nEarning\n\nEarn 3 points per dollar when you book air travel. (Photo by Prostock-studio/Shutterstock)\n\nThe Citi Premier’s earning structure is one aspect where the card really shines. Cardholders earn 3 points per dollar on purchases in the following categories, with no caps or annual limits:\n\nAir travel.\n\nHotels.\n\nGas stations.\n\nSupermarkets.\n\nRestaurants (including takeout).\n\nThe card earns 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. These earning rates are among the most impressive of any travel rewards card, especially considering the Citi Premier’s affordable annual fee.\n\nRelated: The eight best credit cards with annual fees under $100\n\nRedeeming\n\nThe Citi Premier is also a top choice for travelers, thanks to its participation in the ThankYou Rewards program, which currently has 16 airline transfer partners and two hotel partners.\n\nAeromexico Club Premier.\n\nAir France-KLM Flying Blue.\n\nAvianca LifeMiles.\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles.\n\nChoice Privileges.\n\nEmirates Skywards.\n\nEtihad Guest.\n\nEVA Air Infinity MileageLands.\n\nInterMiles (formally known as JetPrivilege).\n\nJetBlue TrueBlue.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Enrich.\n\nQantas Frequent Flyer.\n\nQatar Airways Privilege Club.\n\nSingapore Airlines KrisFlyer.\n\nThai Royal Orchid Plus.\n\nTurkish Airlines Miles & Smiles.\n\nVirgin Atlantic Flying Club.\n\nWyndham Rewards.\n\nWhile you’ll notice that many of the frequent-flyer programs are those of international airlines, there are still some high-value (and easily redeemable) awards to be booked through them.\n\n(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)\n\nFor instance, you can score some cheap Delta awards by booking through Virgin Atlantic, leverage Air France-KLM Flying Blue miles for decent business-class award availability on those airlines and their SkyTeam partners, get some phenomenal deals on Star Alliance awards using Avianca LifeMiles, offset paid fares with JetBlue TrueBlue or even book inexpensive American Airlines business-class tickets using Etihad Guest miles.\n\nYou can also redeem your ThankYou Points for travel directly through the Citi portal at a rate of 1 cent each, but that’s well below TPG’s valuation of ThankYou points at 1.7 cents each, a number derived in part from Citi’s extensive list of transfer partners.\n\nRelated: The ultimate guide to Citi ThankYou Rewards\n\nWhich cards compete with the Citi Premier?\n\n(Photo by John Gribben for The Points Guy)\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, with an annual fee of $95, competes directly with the Citi Premier. While Chase’s transfer partners (including United MileagePlus and Southwest Rapid Rewards) might be more beneficial for many travelers, there are some overlaps, including Singapore KrisFlyer, Emirates Skywards, and Virgin Atlantic Flying Club.\n\nRight now, the Chase Sapphire Preferred has a sign-up bonus of 60,000 points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. Though not the best we’ve seen, TPG values this sign-up bonus at $1,200 — which is worth $160 less than the Citi Premier’s sign-up bonus.\n\nOfficial application link: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card with a 60,000-point bonus.\n\n(Photo by Wyatt Smith/The Points Guy)\n\nAnother direct competitor is the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. It, too, charges a $95 annual fee, but this card comes with a less lucrative (but much simpler) earning rate of 2 miles per dollar on all purchases. Instead of an annual hotel credit, you’ll get an up to a $100 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application credit once every four years with the Venture. You’ll even get two annual lounge visits per year to Capital One’s nascent network of airport lounges.\n\nCapital One miles transfer to 14 airlines and three hotel partner programs, mostly at a 1:1 ratio. Just note that the Capital One rewards program lost JetBlue as a partner this year and Choice Privileges transfers are not yet available.\n\nThe Venture’s sign-up bonus is also worth considering, offering the chance to earn 60,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening. TPG values this sign-up bonus at $1,110 (not provided by the issuer).\n\nOfficial application link: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card with 60,000 bonus miles.\n\n(Photo by Isabelle Raphael/The Points Guy)\n\nFinally, one of the Citi Premier’s closest competitors over at American Express is the American Express® Gold Card, which earns 4 points per dollar at restaurants, 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets on the first $25,000 in purchases per calendar year (then 1 per dollar), 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines or through Amex Travel and 1 point per dollar on other eligible purchases. It has points you can transfer to Membership Rewards’ 18 airline and three hotel partners.\n\nThe Amex Gold Card also comes with up to $10 in monthly dining credits at select restaurants (up to $120 in annual statement credits) and up to $10 in monthly U.S. Uber Cash (up to $120 annually), offsetting the majority of the $250 annual fee (see rates and fees). The card must be added in the Uber app to receive the Uber Cash benefit. Enrollment is required for select benefits.\n\nThe card has a current welcome offer of 60,000 points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership.\n\nOfficial application link: American Express Gold Card with a 60,000-point offer.\n\nBottom line\n\nThanks to its long list of bonus categories and large sign-up bonus, the Citi Premier is one of the most lucrative points-earning cards in its price range. The solid and growing roster of ThankYou Rewards transfer partners also makes these points that much more compelling, especially for travelers who desire the flexibility to redeem points with various loyalty programs.\n\nOfficial application link: Citi Premier® Card with 80,000 bonus ThankYou points after $4,000 in spending in the first three months of account opening.\n\nAdditional reporting by Stella Shon and Eric Rosen.\n\nFor rates and fees of the Amex Gold Card, click here.\n\nFeatured photo by John Gribben for The Points Guy.\n",

          "description": "At this point, there are basically two companies. Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!\n\nThese client APIs are not using anything to verify blockchain state or the authenticity of responses. The results aren’t even signed. An app like Autonomous Art says “hey what’s the output of this view function on this smart contract,” Alchemy or Infura responds with a JSON blob that says “this is the output,” and the app renders it.\n\nThis was surprising to me. So much work, energy, and time has gone into creating a trustless distributed consensus mechanism, but virtually all clients that wish to access it do so by simply trusting the outputs from these two companies without any further verification. It also doesn’t seem like the best privacy situation. Imagine if every time you interacted with a website in Chrome, your request first went to Google before being routed to the destination and back. That’s the situation with ethereum today. All write traffic is obviously already public on the blockchain, but these companies also have visibility into almost all read requests from almost all users in almost all dApps.\n\nHere is the full essay by Momxie (?), interesting throughout.  And more generally:\n\nOne thing that has always felt strange to me about the cryptocurrency world is the lack of attention to the client/server interface. When people talk about blockchains, they talk about distributed trust, leaderless consensus, and all the mechanics of how that works, but often gloss over the reality that clients ultimately can’t participate in those mechanics. All the network diagrams are of servers, the trust model is between servers, everything is about servers. Blockchains are designed to be a network of peers, but not designed such that it’s really possible for your mobile device or your browser to be one of those peers.\n\nRecommended.  Via Nabeel.\n\nThe post How decentralized really are blockchains? appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "Andrew Janjigian\n\nI’ve been making pizza for nearly 40 years, and after all that time I thought I had my dough formulas dialed-in. More than a decade ago I developed a recipe for a New York-style pizza dough for Cook’s Illustrated magazine, which was a big hit and served as the jumping-off point for dozens of subsequent pizza and flatbread recipes. While most of my pizza recipes are optimized for use in home ovens that can't exceed 550°F, I've baked them regularly in blazing hot wood-fired ovens, where they've worked wonderfully. That always made sense to me since, generally speaking, with all else being equal, the hotter and faster you cook a flatbread, the better it comes out, since the interior stays moist and tender while the exterior gets nicely browned and charred.\n\nWhich is why I was stumped when I started baking pies in an Ooni Koda tabletop outdoor gas oven—which easily achieves wood-fired-oven temperatures of 800-900˚F—and they kept burning before the toppings and underside were fully baked. I don’t mean that they charred, mind you. Charring—or leoparding, as the constellation of irregular dark-brown spots on the rim of a well-made pie are commonly referred to—is a good thing, adding welcome Maillard and caramelization flavor to the crust. What I'm talking about is more like incineration, where the rim would be solidly black and unpleasantly bitter in large swathes, oftentimes because they literally caught on fire as the pie baked.\n\nAt first I assumed that it was user error on my part, or a flaw in how my particular oven worked. But then I remembered all the other people making wonderful, not-burned pies in similar tabletop ovens on my Instagram feed. Which made me wonder: Why would my doughs bake beautifully in larger wood-fired ovens but burn in compact tabletop ones like my Ooni when they both heated to identical temperatures?\n\nIt didn’t take long to realize that the difference came down to only one thing: size. In a wood-fired oven, the fire is nestled in one corner of a wide, tall space, leaving loads of room for the pies to cook at a safe distance from it. In a tabletop oven, the pizza sits just inches from the fire, which means it's subjected to a ton of intense heat, with no place to go to to escape from it.\n\nTo figure out what I was doing wrong, I decided to reach out to some of those tabletop pizza oven experts for advice. If they could make it work, then I needed to find out why straight from the source. Almost to a one, they told me this: Avoid adding anything to the dough beyond the four fundamental elements of any bread—flour, water, salt, and yeast—or the pies will burn.\n\nThen it was obvious: That New York-style pizza dough recipe I mentioned above, the one that had launched countless others, was where I’d first gone astray. That’s because in addition to flour, water, salt, and yeast, it contains a few extra ingredients: sugar, oil, and—in later iterations and in several spin-off recipes—something called diastatic malt powder. \n\nAll three of these ingredients are essential components in a pizza dough that is meant to be cooked at a much lower temperature in a home oven, where pizza takes awhile—8 to 12 minutes or so—to brown, because: \n\nSugar promotes browning, since it's sugars—added or naturally found in the dough’s flour—that caramelize in the heat of the oven.\n\nDiastatic malt is an enzyme that converts the starches in flour to sugar, and is often added to doughs to ensure that there is always enough sugar in the crust for good browning.\n\nOil serves to keep the finished pizza tender, since it lubricates the gluten network to keep it supple, even after a relatively long bake. \n\nBut the combination of all three of these things is bad news when the pies cook in just 2 minutes: Sugar and diastatic malt both provide too much \"food\" for caramelization, and oil—in addition to its effect on tenderization—promotes heat transfer from the oven to the pie, speeding up browning all over again.\n\nI ran a series of tests to confirm my suspicion. I made doughs with and without each of these ingredients, and in every case, the pies containing the “extra” elements were prone to burning before the toppings and/or underside were fully cooked. (I also timed how long it took each pie to cross the line between charred and burned, and the only one that lasted longer than 2 minutes was the one without all the add-ins.) \n\nOnce I ditched these amendments to my formula, the rest was easy, especially since there were only four ingredients to consider, and because the remainder of my pizza dough chops were solid:\n\nFlour: I landed on a medium-high protein flour here, one like King Arthur all-purpose—with about 12% protein—instead of bread flours, which are closer to 13%. The protein percentage determines the amount of gluten that forms in a dough and thus the texture of the finished pizza. That's because without oil to tenderize the dough, high-protein bread flour produces a pizza that's a little tough. Reducing the protein slightly helped to restore the lost tenderness. (That said, if you don’t have access to King Arthur all-purpose, bread flour is the next best thing.) \n\nWater: The percentage of water in a dough also has a profound effect upon the final texture of the pie, since water, like oil, also lubricates gluten. So more water is generally better if you want a tender, not-tough dough. But too much water can make a dough sticky and hard-to-handle, so there's a limit, especially if you're trying to create a formula that's easy for beginners and experts alike. I ended up with a 67% hydration dough (or 67g of water for every 100g of flour), a good compromise between ease of handling and maximum tenderness. One note: I actually prefer 70% hydration myself, though that dough can be a touch hard to handle. I offer instructions in the notes below if you want to increase the hydration once you're comfortable with this dough.\n\nYeast: Almost all of my pizza doughs are cold-fermented, meaning they spend at least a few days in the fridge before use (more on why below). Because of this I use a tiny amount of yeast—0.4%, or just 1/2 teaspoon for three to four pizzas worth—to avoid runaway fermentation. \n\nSalt: Most breads, pizza included, contain between 1.5 to 2.5% salt; I like a high percentage of salt in my pizza doughs—2.2% in this case—as it ensures the crust has the robust flavor it needs to stand up to toppings that are (often) intensely flavored . \n\nAs for the mechanics of dough mixing, kneading, and the initial fermentation, it’s all pretty straightforward. You use a food processor to quickly mix the dough, minus the salt, and then you let it rest for 20 minutes. This step, known as an autoylse, helps passively develop gluten so that the dough doesn’t overheat during machine kneading. Then you add the salt and knead the dough in the machine until it’s well-developed, which takes about 30 seconds. \n\nAfter that, you put the dough in a bowl and allow it to proof at room temperature until it's puffy, which takes about an hour or two, which gives fermentation a jumpstart before you divide the dough, shape it into balls, and move the balls into the fridge. \n\nCold fermentation is a fundamental technique for dough-making for a few key reasons:\n\nFlavor: Cold fermentation develops a complexity of flavor in the dough that a fast fermentation can't, thanks to the sorts of flavorful compounds that form only when a dough proofs at low temperatures. (At higher temperatures, those compounds get converted fully to carbon dioxide, the gas that gives bread lift.) \n\nEasy Stretching: This slow fermentation gives the dough time to relax, which makes it easy to stretch out into a nice round disk without the dough fighting back. Not only does this help improve the look of your pies, it keeps them tender, because an overworked dough yields a tough, chewy pizza. \n\nConvenience: While this method does require advanced planning, you can make pizza anytime within a 3-day window once the doughs are in the fridge, only an hour or two after you pull them out. \n\nThe recipe makes four 225-gram dough balls—sized to make 10-inch pies, which I think are an ideal diameter for a smaller (12-inch) oven—or three 300-gram dough balls, sized to make 12-inch pies in a larger (16-inch) oven. \n\nI strongly recommend that you cold-proof the dough in individual containers—like the 7-inch plastic takeout container pictured above—rather than side-by-side on a rimmed baking sheet. This helps to prevent the dough balls from kissing one another, which will make them hard to separate without tearing, but it also it means you can handle each ball as gently as possible, which will help you to avoid overworking the dough before you shape it.\n\nCombine flour and yeast in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times until well-combined. With machine running, add water and continue to process until mixture forms rough ball and no dry flour remains, 10 to 20 seconds. Allow to rest for 20 minutes.\n\nAndrew Janjigian\n\nAdd salt to top of dough and process until a mostly smooth ball of dough forms, 20 to 30 seconds. Dough temperature should register 75°F (24°C) on an instant-read thermometer when mixing is complete. If not, continue to mix in 10 second intervals until it reaches the desired dough temperature. Transfer dough ball to a lightly oiled medium bowl and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed. Cover bowl and let dough sit for 45 minutes.\n\nAndrew Janjigian\n\nUsing lightly-moistened hands, knead dough in bowl until uniform in texture, 5 to 10 seconds. Cover and let sit at room temperature until puffy and not quite doubled in volume, 60 to 120 minutes.\n\nAndrew Janjigian\n\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured countertop and divide into four pieces of about 225g (8 ounces) each for 12-inch ovens, or three pieces of about 300g (10.5 ounces) each for 16-inch ovens. Form each portion into a smooth, round ball. Coat exterior of dough ball lightly with oil and place each in a 4- to 7-inch round, lidded plastic takeout container, or on a lightly-oiled tray, spaced at least 2 inches apart, covered loosely but completely. Refrigerate dough for at least 24 hours or up to 4 days (48 to 72 hours is ideal).\n\nAndrew Janjigian\n\nOn the day you plan to bake pizzas, remove dough balls from refrigerator and allow to warm up, covered, 1 to 2 hours before baking. Exact timing depends upon ambient temperature; dough should reach at least 60°F (15.5°C) before stretching and baking.\n\nAndrew Janjigian\n\nSpecial Equipment\n\nDigital scale, jeweler's scale, food processor, round plastic takeout containers or dough-proofing boxes\n\nNotes\n\nFor best results, use a digital scale set in grams to measure ingredients. For the yeast, using a jeweler's scale will give you the most precise measurement possible.\n\nIf King Arthur all-purpose flour is unavailable, bread flour may be used in its place.\n\nOnce you are comfortable working with this dough, you can try increasing the hydration. I really like this dough at 70% hydration, but it's slightly more difficult to work with, and inexperienced pizza-makers may find that it's more prone to tearing during stretching. To increase the hydration to 70%, use 375g (13.2 ounces) of water in step 1 (an additional 25g).\n\nMake-Ahead and Storage\n\nThe pizza dough needs to be made at least 24 hours ahead of baking. It can be refrigerated for up to 4 days, but 2 to 3 days is ideal.\n",

          "description": "Now is the time to set the wheels in motion towards your Southwest Companion Pass.  The end of the calendar year is the ideal time to sign up for Southwest credit cards in order to earn huge numbers of qualifying points quickly.  If you earn the Companion Pass early enough in the calendar year, it will be good for almost 2 full years: the rest of the year in which it is earned and all of the next.  Keep in mind that the most recent great offers for the Southwest personal cards (100K points after $12K spend) are scheduled to end soon: Tuesday, December 7th.\n\nThe Southwest Companion Pass is awesome.  Sure, it’s not as awesome as the companion pass-ish thingy that Aeropan now offers (details here), but it doesn’t require a million dollars of spend.  The Southwest Companion Pass only requires earning 125,000 qualifying points in a calendar year, and points earned on credit cards (including welcome bonuses) qualify.\n\nOnce you earn 125,000 qualifying points, you can add a companion for free to all of your Southwest flights for the rest of that year and all of the next year.  That’s true regardless of whether you book flights with cash or with points.  If you fly Southwest a lot with a companion, or you want to, this is obviously an incredible deal.\n\nStrategies\n\nEven though Chase offers three different personal Southwest cards, they’ll only let you have one at any given time.  Plus, you can’t get the welcome bonus for a personal card if you’ve earned the welcome bonus on any of the personal cards in the past 24 months.  These rules do not apply to Southwest business cards.  With business cards, it’s true that you can’t sign up if you currently have the exact same card or if you’ve earned the bonus on the same card in the past 24 months.  But, you can sign up if you have a different business card or any personal Southwest card and it doesn’t matter when you last earned bonuses on those cards.  All of that boils down to the following:\n\nIf eligible, you can sign up for any 1 of the Southwest personal cards (but only 1).\n\nIf eligible, you can also sign up for the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Credit Card.\n\nIf eligible, you can also sign up for Chase Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Premier Business Card.\n\nKeep in mind that you won’t be approved for a Southwest card if you are over 5/24.  If you are approved, the Southwest business cards won’t add to your 5/24 count, but the personal cards will.\n\nChase's 5/24 Rule: With most Chase credit cards, Chase will not approve your application if you have opened 5 or more cards with any bank in the past 24 months.\n\nTo determine your 5/24 status, see: 3 Easy Ways to Count Your 5/24 Status. The easiest option is to track all of your cards for free with Travel Freely.\n\nWith that info, here are a couple of strategies for earning the Companion Pass:\n\nStrategy One: 1 Card\n\nThrough December 7th, each of the personal cards are currently offering a total of 100K points after $12K spend:\n\nCard Offer\n\nChase Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards® Plus Card\n\n \n\n \n\n➥More\n\n \n\nⓘ $1139\n1st Yr Value Estimate\n\nUp to 100K Points\n100K: 50K after $2K spend in 3 months plus 50K after a total of $12K spend in 12 months\n(Offer Expires 12/7/2021)\n\n$69 Annual Fee\n\n \n\n \n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\nRecent better offer: None.

This is the highest public offer we've seen.\n\n \n\n \n\nIf you sign up now, your first statement closing date will be in January 2022.  As a result, all points earned on the card will credit in 2022 and will count towards the Companion Pass in 2022.  If you quickly spend $25K on your new card, you’ll earn a total of 125,000 points and a Companion Pass that is valid for the rest of 2022 and all of 2023.\n\nHow can you spend $25K so quickly?  One option is to pay (or overpay) estimated taxes.  Another option is to pay bills with Plastiq.  Both options incur fees (~2% and 2.85%, respectively), but that can be well worth it to get the Companion Pass.\n\nNote too that it might not be necessary to spend so much.  In 2021, Southwest gave all members 25,000 qualifying points towards the Companion Pass.  If they do the same in 2022 then you’ll only need to spend $12,000 on your new card in order to earn the full welcome bonus and the Companion Pass.\n\nStrategy Two: 2 Cards\n\nThe current Southwest business card offers aren’t as good as the personal card offers, but if you get both (or one personal and one business), you’ll have more than enough points for the Companion Pass.  Here are the current business card offers:\n\nCard Offer\n\nChase Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Card\n\n \n\n \n\n➥More\n\n \n\nⓘ $693\n1st Yr Value Estimate\n\n60K miles\n60K after $3K spend in 3 months\n\n$99 Annual Fee\n\n \n\n \n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n \n\n \n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Credit Card\n\n \n\n \n\n➥More\n\n \n\nⓘ $841\n1st Yr Value Estimate\n\n80K points\n80K after $5K spend in first 3 months\n\n$199 Annual Fee\n\n \n\n \n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n \n\n \n\nWith the offers available at the time of this writing, you would only need to complete $8K spend across the two business cards in order to earn the welcome bonuses.  And with that spend, you would end up with nearly 150,000 Southwest points.  Boom.\n\nA downside to signing up for two cards is that it will be a bit over two years before you can sign up for either card again.  If your goal is to earn a Companion Pass every few years, this would limit your options.  On the other hand, if you have a regular companion who can alternate with you in earning the Companion Pass, you can stretch out your sign-ups to approximately once every four years.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great time to sign up for one or more Southwest cards if you’re interested in earning a Companion Pass.  By earning the pass early in 2022, it will be valid for nearly two full years!\n\nThe post It’s Time: Get Your Southwest Companion Pass appeared first on Frequent Miler.\n",

          "description": "Rep. Lauren Boebert speaks during a press conference at the US Capitol in June. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nInaction normalizes anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiment.\n\nCongressional leaders are struggling to respond to anti-Muslim comments made by Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), an uncomfortable reminder of how accepted Islamophobia has become among Republican lawmakers, who’ve broadly been silent in the wake of these statements.\n\nTwo weeks ago during a floor speech, Boebert referred to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of three Muslim House lawmakers and the only one to wear a hijab, as a member of the “jihad squad.”\n\n“The Jihad Squad member from Minnesota has paid her husband, and not her brother husband, the other one, over a million dollars in campaign funds,” she said in her remarks.\n\nOver the Thanksgiving recess, Boebert again made anti-Muslim remarks in a speech, claiming that once while riding an elevator Omar was on, she saw a worried Capitol Police officer approaching. In her comments at the November event, Boebert said they had nothing to fear from the Democrat because she wasn’t wearing a backpack, insinuating that Omar could have been a suicide bomber.\n\nThis week, it was reported that Boebert has told this story in public more than once. (Omar has said she never witnessed Boebert have this exchange with an officer.)\n\nFact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol, this whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout.\n\nAnti-Muslim bigotry isn’t funny & shouldn’t be normalized. Congress can’t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation. https://t.co/S1APT7RbqW\n\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) November 26, 2021\n\nBoebert later apologized to “anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment,” but has yet to publicly apologize to Omar, and went on to accuse Omar of anti-American rhetoric in a phone call the two had earlier this week, according to a statement she later made.\n\nBoebert’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThus far, Republican leadership has been quiet on the matter, issuing no public condemnation of Boebert’s comments. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Friday that Boebert had already apologized for her comments and reached out to Omar, even though the call they had didn’t have a resolution. “This party is for anyone and everyone who craves freedom and supports religious liberty,” McCarthy said of the GOP.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have condemned Boebert’s Islamophobic remarks but have yet to put forth a formal resolution or penalty regarding her statements. Beyond a statement condemning Boebert, Democrats and Republicans have a couple of options for punishment, including a resolution denouncing these comments, a formal reprimand or censure, or the stripping of committee assignments. At this point, neither party has publicly announced further action they would take.\n\nPressure for a more serious punishment is building: On Thursday, five Democratic House caucus chairs called for Boebert to be stripped of her committee assignments, much like Reps. Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene were in the wake of posts they made seeming to promote political violence. The caucus chairs argue that inaction in the face of Boebert’s comments effectively condones Islamophobia and sends a message about what types of extremist comments Congress is willing to accept.\n\n“There must be consequences for elected representatives who traffic in anti-Muslim and racist tropes that make all Muslims across the country less safe,” the lawmakers write.\n\nResearchers have indeed found that Islamophobic rhetoric by politicians has real-world consequences and has been directly linked with hate speech targeted toward Muslim Americans. If Congress doesn’t impose more penalties regarding this incident, lawmakers could — whether they mean to or not — further normalize anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiment, affecting not only Muslim lawmakers but millions of Muslim Americans as well.\n\nIn their lack of response, Republicans, in particular, have shown that their party isn’t willing to denounce such Islamophobic statements. And this creates the appearance that the party is open to embracing the hateful rhetoric that former President Donald Trump and others have used.\n\n“The truth is that Islamophobia pervades our culture, our politics, and even policy decisions,” Omar said at a press conference on Wednesday. “The most pervasive is the constant suggestion that all Muslims are terrorists and should be feared. So when a sitting member of Congress calls a colleague a member of the ‘jihad squad’ and falsifies a story to suggest that I will blow up the Capitol, it is not just an attack on me, but on millions of American Muslims across this country.”\n\n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) speaks at a news conference about Islamophobia on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, November 30.\n\nHow Congress acts in response to this incident — and others like it — sets a tone that extends far beyond its halls.\n\nCongressional inaction condones Islamophobia\n\nCongressional inaction toward Boebert’s comments only helps normalize them, and the fact that Boebert hasn’t faced more immediate consequences from either party makes it seem as though expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment are acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats’ outright condemnation was important, but the delay in additional disciplinary action has been surprising to Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\n\n“I believe that so far the response from the Democratic leadership is weak and late and doesn’t meet the seriousness of these attacks,” Awad told Vox. “Islamophobia has unfortunately become a reality of our life as American Muslims. It has not been tackled with the vigor and the swiftness it needs to be dealt with.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican response to Boebert’s comments further reaffirms leadership’s seeming willingness to accept or look past the bigotry and rhetoric of its members.\n\nThe decision to stay silent on this front follows Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s treatment of a video posted by Gosar that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and drawing weapons against President Joe Biden. At the time, McCarthy did not publicly condemn Gosar. As the Washington Post reported on Thursday, Republican leadership has sought to address internal conflicts, but focused less on the issue of Islamophobia.\n\nMcCarthy has spoken out about other discriminatory statements caucus members have made in the past. Though he did not do so immediately after they came to light, he did publicly denounce several anti-Semitic and violent statements Greene had made. More recently, McCarthy responded to her comments comparing being required to wear masks to the Holocaust by saying, “Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling.”\n\nAs the Post notes, however, his approach to colleagues making extremist comments seems to have shifted since his statements about Greene in May, with some speculating that he’s now focused on building support for winning the House speakership — and keeping the base satisfied to do so.\n\nMcCarthy’s approach, when it comes to Boebert’s remarks, has been indicative of many rank-and-file Republicans’ reactions to her statements as well. While Reps. Nancy Mace (R-SC) and Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) are among those who have spoken out and criticized Boebert’s comments, many others in the caucus have shied away from confronting them directly. Greene, meanwhile, echoed Boebert’s “jihad squad” rhetoric in her own tweet this week.\n\nIt’s another sign that many Republicans are willing to stay quiet when it comes to criticizing bigotry and extremism by their members, putting Democrats in a position where they have to be the ones to act. Republicans have been quick to decry certain forms of bigotry they have said they’ve seen in the Democratic caucus, for instance attempting to censure progressive lawmakers — including Omar — for criticisms of Israel that some perceived as anti-Semitic. Democrats have also criticized Omar for similar reasons.\n\n“Republicans have long been critical of Omar for her criticisms of Israel, and members of both parties have denounced some of her statements as antisemitic,” the Washington Post’s Jacqueline Alemany and Marianna Sotomayor write. “In 2019, House Democratic leaders swiftly condemned Omar’s suggestion that Israel’s allies in American politics were motivated by money rather than principle. Omar apologized later that day.”\n\nCongress is known for moving slowly in general, though the response to the Boebert comments has taken a while. Democrats responded after a week and a half regarding the video Gosar posted depicting violence toward Ocasio-Cortez. Gosar had posted that video around November 7 and was censured by the House on November 17. Boebert first made her floor speech using the term “jihad squad” on November 17 and then used the term at another event, video of which was posted on November 25.\n\nDemocrats have argued that there could be downsides to punishing Boebert; they worry that doing so could further raise her profile and boost her ability to fundraise from conservative voters. Greene brought in more than $3 million in fundraising in the first quarter of this year after her committee assignments were stripped. Some Democrats have also said they don’t want to be in a position of constantly disciplining Republicans who make extremist and racist statements, according to Politico.\n\nStill, as was evident in the punishments levied on Gosar and Greene, Democrats act when they feel it is necessary. As the Hill reported, Democrats considered a resolution to condemn Islamophobia earlier this week but were focused on putting pressure on House Republicans to act. In an MSNBC interview Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Democrats were still discussing what the “appropriate action” is.\n\n“It’s not an option to ignore it because it might help her raise money,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) stressed at a press conference earlier this week. Punishment “sends a message to the rest of our colleagues that this is unacceptable.”\n\nPolitical statements can be tied to real-life violence\n\nIn the wake of Boebert’s latest statements, Omar has been the target of anti-Muslim vitriol and death threats, an apparent consequence of the recent Islamophobic remarks. Researchers have found that the rhetoric used by public officials could have an impact on the rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence — a major reason it’s important for House leadership to push back against it.\n\n“There’s a through line between what is said about me ... what my colleagues have said ... and the death threats I receive,” Omar said this week.\n\nAt the Wednesday press conference, Omar played one of the threatening voicemails — a message filled with racist and Islamophobic slurs — she’s received following her call with Boebert. Omar and other progressive women of color including Reps. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib have long faced numerous death threats since they’ve been elected.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) plays a horrific death threat she received following Rep. Lauren Boebert’s (R-CO) recent Islamophobic attacks on her.\n\nWarning: It's incredibly graphic. pic.twitter.com/5PGODcaJOu\n\n— The Recount (@therecount) November 30, 2021\n\nThere have also been several recent examples of political speech being tied to actual violence. Participants in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol have referenced comments by Trump and said he instructed them to go to the building. Trump had called on a crowd to “fight like hell” prior to the storming of the Capitol, telling attendees “we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue ... and we are going to the Capitol.”\n\nResearch has indicated that anti-Muslim rhetoric can be linked to hate crimes, based on the limited data that law enforcement sources currently have. A 2016 study from California State University San Bernardino, for example, found an 87.5 percent increase in hate crimes toward Muslim Americans after Trump called for a ban on Muslim people entering the country.\n\nSince the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Awad notes that anti-Muslim rhetoric has been normalized by many politicians, who’ve leveraged Islamophobia to energize members of their base. A 2021 CAIR survey found that 69 percent of Muslim Americans said they’d experienced an instance of anti-Muslim bigotry since the 9/11 attacks, and 95 percent said they’d speak out if they heard negative comments about Muslims and Islam.\n\n“We have been fighting — as an institution and as a community — Islamophobia for the past 20 years,” Awad said. “Over the years, it’s been elevated, normalized, and legislated. We have the most influential people in our lives trafficking in Islamophobia believing that it will get them somewhere with their base.”\n\nTlaib echoed this point this week, emphasizing the effect Congress’s actions in this case could have.\n\n“I’m also here today in support of the 3.45 million Muslim neighbors in our country, because it’s also their lives that are put in grave danger when people like Rep. Boebert are allowed to use their national platform and elected office to spread hate and dangerous racist rhetoric that enables violence toward Muslims,” Tlaib said.\n\nLawmakers would be making a mistake if they weigh nullifying the political benefits Boebert could extract from any punishment more heavily than making a decisive statement against Islamophobia.\n",

          "description": "TPG senior news editor Clint Henderson recently described his third pandemic-era trip to Hawaii as “easy, breezy, beautiful.” If you’ve also got Hawaii on your mind — and just about any transferrable currency in your pocket — you can use today’s domestic award sweet spot to fly to Hawaii on Delta-operated flights.\n\nIn this guide, I’ll describe how to leverage the Air France/KLM Flying Blue program to fly round-trip between the mainland U.S. and Hawaii for just 35,000 Flying Blue miles plus minimal taxes and fees. Don’t worry if you don’t have any Flying Blue miles yet, though. Flying Blue is a transfer partner of multiple transferrable currencies, including American Express Membership Rewards, Capital One Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards.\n\nGet the latest points, miles and travel news by signing up for TPG’s free daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nWhy it’s special\n\n(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)\n\nFrankly, there are many ways to get to Hawaii using points and miles. For example, I recently wrote about how you can fly to Hawaii from 13,000 Avios each way. And you can also fly to Hawaii for just 15,000 Turkish miles round-trip. So, redeeming 35,000 Flying Blue miles for an economy-class round trip isn’t the lowest cost award you’ll find to Hawaii. And if you can find a non-stop Delta award of fewer than 3,000 miles, redeeming Virgin Atlantic Flying Club miles may provide better value.\n\nBut, if you want to fly a longer Delta non-stop flight or Delta-operated connecting flights to Hawaii, you should consider the Air France/KLM Flying Blue program. After all, if you can find award space, you can frequently book Delta-operated awards from mainland U.S. to Hawaii with the Flying Blue program for far less than with Delta Skymiles. And unlike many of the Hawaii award flight sweet spots, you’re not limited to west-coast gateways. Instead, assuming you can find award availability, you can fly from anywhere in the mainland U.S. that’s served by Delta.\n\nRelated: You may not need a test for Hawaii anymore: Everything you need to know about visiting the islands now\n\nHow to book this award\n\nYou can book Flying Blue awards via Air France or KLM. Both sites can be frustrating to use, but let’s walk through how to book this award on the KLM site.\n\nStart here and click on “Book via KLM.” Once you do so, you’ll need to log in to your Flying Blue account. So, create an account if you don’t already have one.\n\n(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)\n\nAfter logging in, you can enter your desired flight details. I recommend searching for a one-way award for one passenger unless you must travel in a larger group.\n\n(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)\n\nAfter clicking the “Search flights” button, you may get a message stating, “Sorry, there are no fares available for this date. Please try again.” If you get this message, you may need to go back to the start to search for availability on a different date since this page often acts buggy. But, if you happened to search for a route and date with availability, you’ll see some award options on the next page.\n\n(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)\n\nIf you found an award option that works for your trip, click the green box that shows the rate. Doing so will take you to a page where you can see the details of your award ticket.\n\n(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)\n\nIf these details are acceptable, click on “Select” and then on “Continue to trip summary.” Doing so will show a final trip summary.\n\n(Screenshot courtesy of klm.nl)\n\nIf this summary is correct and you want to continue with your booking, click “Continue to passenger details.” If you have enough miles in your account, you can enter the passenger details for your award and complete the booking. But, if you don’t have enough miles in your account, you’ll see the following error: “Unfortunately, you do not have enough Miles for this booking. Please select a different flight.” I don’t have enough miles in my account, so this is as far as I can guide you through the booking process.\n\n Related: The best websites for searching SkyTeam award availability\n\nHow to earn miles for this award\n\n(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)\n\nDon’t worry if you don’t have enough miles in your Flying Blue account to book your award. One of the highlights of Flying Blue is that it’s a transfer partner of multiple transferrable currencies, including:\n\nAmerican Express Membership Rewards: 1:1 transfer ratio (transfers are instant)\n\nCapital One Rewards: 2:1.5 transfer ratio (transfers are instant)\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards: 1:1 transfer ratio (transfers are instant)\n\nCiti ThankYou Rewards: 1:1 transfer ratio (transfers are instant)\n\nMarriott Bonvoy: 3:1 transfer ratio (transfers take about three days)\n\nIf you have transferrable points and miles, it’s easy to get enough miles to redeem for Flying Blue awards. However, if you want to replenish your stash of transferrable points and miles, consider adding one of the following travel rewards cards to your wallet and spending to earn its bonus:\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express: Earn 100,000 Membership Rewards points after you spend $6,000 on purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Plus, earn 10x points on eligible purchases on your new card at restaurants worldwide and when you Shop Small in the U.S. (on up to $25,000 in combined purchases) during your first six months of card membership.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Card: Earn 100,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nCiti Premier® Card: Earn 80,000 ThankYou points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening.\n\nAmerican Express® Gold Card: Earn 60,000 Membership Rewards points after you spend $4,000 on purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership.\n\nThe Business Platinum Card® from American Express: Earn 125,000 Membership Rewards points after you spend $15,000 on eligible purchases with your card in the first three months of card membership.\n\nAlternatively, you could add the Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard® to your wallet. This $89 annual fee card currently offers a sign-up bonus of a $100 statement credit and 50,000 bonus miles after you make $2,000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of your account opening. Plus, you’ll earn 3x miles on purchases with SkyTeam member airlines and 1.5x miles on all other purchases.\n\nRelated: Sweet Spot Sunday: Fly from the US to Europe, North Africa from 21,500 miles each way\n\nBottom line\n\nThere are many ways to use points and miles to fly to Hawaii. Today I discussed one method: redeeming Air France/KLM Flying Blue miles for Delta-operated flights. This method isn’t best for everyone, but it can provide excellent value for central and east coast U.S. residents. And, since there’s no benefit to booking this award as a round trip, you could book an open-jaw itinerary and visit two (or more) Hawaiian islands. Then, you could book your inter-island Hawaii travel separately.\n\nFinally, before transferring points to Flying Blue, check cash rates for your award. We’ve recently seen some excellent deals, including Hawaii flights from $81 each way. If you’re looking to transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points, you may get a better deal booking travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal when paid rates are low. And you can redeem Capital One miles at a fixed rate toward new or existing travel purchases. So, although you can often get excellent value by transferring points, it’s always worth checking cash rates too.\n\nFeatured image of a cove near Hyatt’s Hana-Maui Resort by Zach Honig/The Points Guy.\n",

          "description": "Mode says its smart cannabis device lets you control your dosage | Mode\n\nFor people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes, such as pain management, anxiety, and sleep, vaping the drug can be a bit of a trial-and-error process since you can’t be totally sure of the exact dose you’re getting like you can with a standard edible or pill. The makers of the Mode smart cannabis device say it solves the dosing problem, using a high-res pressure sensor to determine how much a user is inhaling and a prediction algorithm that determines how many micromilligrams a user is getting per puff based on the cartridge.\n\nThe company says it’s run hundreds of cannabis cartridges through its testing machines to identify each one’s unique characteristics, and the device has an accuracy rate of over 75 percent even without letting the app know which cartridge you’re using. (It’s in the high 80 percent range for known cartridges, the company claims.) Mode is compatible with thousands of standard 510 threaded cannabis cartridges, and it can be locked manually or remotely with the companion app. The company says the algorithm is still improving, and you'll be able to download a new version to the device over Bluetooth.\n\nPeople treat many different medical conditions with cannabis, some using different varieties to treat more than one condition. For example, a user may need a different dose — and likely a different blend — of cannabis to treat anxiety during the day than they would use as a sleep aid at night. That’s why being able to fine-tune the number of milligrams would come in handy.\n\n“This is not just another vape device you’re hitting and blowing out clouds all day,” Mode co-founder Izzy Kirsch said in a demonstration over Zoom during the Consumer Electronics Show. “You can get a milligram pill, so to speak, and go on with your day.”\n\nSo let’s say you’re using cannabis for sleep and you know what dosage you want. Put your cartridge into the Mode device, set it to a dosage between 1 and 5 milligrams, and inhale. The device turns off its heater and vibrates, giving haptic feedback, when you’ve reached your desired dosage.\n\nMode co-founder Mark Wagner said during the CES demo that the company is software-oriented, so rather than building a special sensor to measure dosage, it’s working on fine-tuning the algorithm, which was developed in part by a former data science lead at Jawbone. In addition to a pressure sensor, Mode has temperature, motion, and orientation sensors that help create the ideal dose.\n\nThe device also has a mobile app that lets users track their dosage over time, which is helpful information if you’re testing out a new strain or if you decide your dosage is too strong or too weak. The device bases its measurements on the cartridge manufacturer’s information. For people buying cartridges at a dispensary where the product is a known quantity, the Mode device relying on manufacturer info seems reasonable. However, it’s worth noting that black market and counterfeit cartridges may not provide the same level of accurate info (and can potentially lead to serious illness).\n\nIn the relatively new medical cannabis marketplace, patients can end up going through a lot of trial and error finding a strain and a cartridge that gives them the amount they need — even the batteries used with standard cannabis cartridges can vary wildly in how they deliver your dosage. So a device that gives more user control over how much you’re consuming is a welcome addition.\n\nMode says its device is made with medical-grade materials, including a tear-resistant silicone air passageway that goes all the way from the bottom of the device through to the cartridge, separate from all its electronics except for the pressure sensor. It uses high-grade stainless steel on the heat shield in the tube, and the outer case is raw ABS plastic; the company says it’s staying away from paint, which can lead to emissions.\n\nMode uses USB-C charging, with a 385mAh custom battery. It can provide between a week and two weeks of battery life for a user taking 5 to 20mg per day, “not someone who’s continually crushing through cartridges,” Kirsch notes.\n\nMode is available for preorder and will retail for $100 when it’s available later this year. The company's targeting early summer.\n",

          "description": "In places around the world where Covid-19 is substantially under control—such as in Australia, Taiwan, and Singapore—governments and companies are allowing, and even encouraging, people to head back to the office. Once vaccines become widely available, many companies will hope to return to “business as usual.” But one new feature is likely here to stay: the part-in/part-out, hybrid team.\n\nWorking from home has distinct advantages: a smaller office presence cuts infrastructure costs; fewer commuters reduces planet-destroying emissions, and some people love it. In a recent survey of 4,700 knowledge workers conducted by Slack, nearly three-quarters of respondents said they prefer a hybrid model in which some work happens at home. In an earlier poll by Adecco, respondents were split about whether or not working from home has been a positive experience.\n\n“The real challenge in keeping a hybrid workforce energized is not technological or logistical, but emotional.”\n\nIn a forthcoming survey done by Bates Smart, a designer of workspaces in Australia, younger employees were four times as likely as older ones to want to return to the office. Kellie Payne, the firm’s director, says this may be due to a disparity of home amenities. “They don’t have wifi powerful enough to make their hair stand on end, hence need to post a wifi usage schedule on the fridge in a shared flat.” Confidentiality was also an issue for younger workers, including four roommates who are lawyers in competing firms.\n\nLeaders should respond to this mixed desire by offering employees real workplace flexibility, where feasible, creating hybrid teams in which those who work best from home continue to do so, while others return to the office.\n\nManaging a hybrid team may sound complex, but leaders of multinational corporations have been doing a version of this for years. I’ve spent much of my career running Asia-Pacific business for companies including Google, Twitter and Cloudflare. This has me living in Singapore alongside some of my team members, while managing groups in a dozen countries across Asia. As I’ve learned, the real challenge in keeping a hybrid workforce energized is not technological or logistical, but emotional.\n\nEmotional connection helps workers feel engaged, which can improve overall profitability by more than 20%, according to research by Gallup. Connection is key to having motivated, successful employees. I think of it as removing the “r” from remote, as in emote. Here’s how.\n\nHelp employees build social connections\n\nSocial capital boosts employee morale and is essential for the collaborative work of so many firms today. In headquarters, during normal times, workers create relationships with colleagues and executives naturally—through hallway chats or serendipitous meetings at the local take-out joint, as well as at planned social events such as rooftop happy hours and office picnics. Leaders of hybrid teams will have to do what regional and global leaders have always done: work extra hard to create opportunities for connection between their onsite employees and those they need to know far away.\n\nWhen social gatherings return, leaders should ensure they’re appealing enough to entice the at-home team to come in. Food still draws a crowd, as does an unusual activity people wouldn’t try on their own. Many companies have recurring events like annual sales conferences where distributed staff meet to celebrate accomplishments, plan for the year, and laugh their hearts out.\n\nIn Singapore, at one pre-Covid quarterly kick-off for which managers flew in, people from all levels strapped on helmets to race around a track in noisy go-karts, including those who would never, ever, in any other circumstance do something like this (such as me). It was fun and unexpected, and people turned out for it. Richard Alfonsi, who’s held global leadership roles at Stripe, Twitter, and Google, says that annual employee conferences and everything around them were often a highlight of the year for the team and a much needed “shot of pure company adrenaline.”\n\nEmphasizing the “human factor” is critical to helping hybrid teams gel.\n\nDuring lockdown, at Cloudflare, we invited all 200-plus people in our Asia Pacific region to play a virtual game called “Unlock-It,” in which small groups solve clues to pick locks and “rob” a bank. Go-karting, Unlock-It, and other in-person and virtual social and activities allow people to express aspects of their personality that don’t come out in the normal workday (including, in my company, one always-quiet employee from Japan who revealed an unknown inner speed demon).\n\nFar from frivolous, these kinds of activities break down the walls between “boss” and “employee” and allow people to see each other as whole individuals. Emphasizing the “human factor” is critical to helping hybrid teams gel.\n\nMake everyone feel included \n\nOne way home-based team members can stay connected is by logging onto an always-on video or audio conference.  At Hive in San Francisco, for example, all employees have an open Google Hangout on their desktop during the workday. These open rooms mimic having office mates around.\n\nManagers of hybrid teams should over-communicate company news and updates to ensure everyone feels tied to what’s happening. Silicon Valley firms have weekly town halls to share the company’s strategy and priorities; as they’ve gone global, these town halls have become virtual, allowing people everywhere to attend. In the future, companies will have a choice: they can allow local home-based workers to log in, or encourage/require them to come to the office once a week. (A snack or donuts and coffee increases attendance, I’ve learned.)\n\nCatalyzing employees around a cause is another great way to increase their sense of being included. It also builds company loyalty by helping people feel good about themselves. Compelling cause-related opportunities are especially important when recruiting and retaining young workers, many of whom say a company’s values determine their desire to take a job. Some, like the mustache growing fundraiser Movember, allow people to share the physical experience of growing a mustache remotely, creating a feeling of “being in it together” regardless of where their desk is.\n\nOffer public praise, and private support\n\nHome-based workers aren’t second-class citizens, but consistently being away from the office can make them feel that way. One risk with a hybrid workplace is that dispersed workers will feel—or genuinely be—overlooked and/or under-recognized.\n\nIn the regional office, I’ve always relied on the power of public praise to help people feel valued and seen. Leaders of future hybrid teams will need to do this, too. At Cloudflare, weekly town halls end with “shout-outs” from employees to colleagues, read aloud by our COO. Google puts its money behind the praise mission, offering “peer bonus” funds for employees to give to helpful colleagues. At Mediacorp, Singapore’s national broadcaster, workers at all levels can give “kudos” to fellow employees; these appear in the company’s online Hall of Fame.\n\nThe future of work means returning to some of what functioned well in the past, keeping the lessons learned during the pandemic, and harnessing the best of both going forward.\n\nEven those choosing to work from home can feel isolated or anxious about their roles, and fatigued by hours of video conferencing. Leaders should make sure to limit video participation to what’s truly necessary, and make an extra effort to connect with employees who seem to be suffering.\n\nModel boundaries\n\nRegional workers often have to get up early or stay up late for meetings due to differences in time zones. This can blur the line between work time and personal time—a reality for everyone today that will remain a challenge for tomorrow’s home-by-choice workers. At regional offices, to keep our sanity and prevent our days from feeling like “time soup,” we have to establish clear boundaries that include breaks for our personal lives. Leaders need to communicate these boundaries. Alfonsi says he avoided sending emails at all hours, not wanting to make his far-flung teams think they should be online 24/7 to respond.\n\nIf I have a late night meeting, I take time to exercise or handle other personal tasks between 9am and 5pm, and keep my online calendar accessible, which lets team members see how I’m spending my time, including my daily gym visit. I also let headquarters know that midnight or dawn meetings can only happen twice a week.\n\nRedesign offices with more collaboration space \n\nCompanies need to adapt the office space they do keep to better facilitate collaboration and mingling. For big tech firms, this may mean using workspace only as a hub for social, cultural and creativity needs that can’t be met virtually, says Payne. Some companies may eliminate private desks altogether, as Dropbox has decided to do.\n\nOther firms rely on regular face-to-face interaction, and will need to do so going forward. As the head of a global law firm recently told me, young associates aren’t learning as much now because they need to be able to ask questions of more experienced lawyers easily and frequently. The firm worries about a “lost generation” of attorneys due to a year of working at home. It plans to reformat future offices to increase joint working.\n\nThe future of work means returning to some of what functioned well in the past, keeping the lessons learned during the pandemic, and harnessing the best of both going forward. In a way, this is something leaders of dispersed teams have always done. As I’ve seen, a little extra effort can make off-site colleagues feel close, and inspire great things in everyone.\n",

          "description": "Gary Leff at View from the Wing notes that there is a way to save on rooms at some Las Vegas strip properties: book via Airbnb to side-step the resort fee and potentially save some cash as well.\n\nSeveral Las Vegas properties have condos. Gary lists properties like The Signature and MGM, which I believe has been available in the past via Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts, as well as casino-less properties like MGM’s Vdara and Hilton’s Elara. I wouldn’t expect to earn elite nights or credits when booking through Airbnb (like you would for MGM nights booked through MGM or Hyatt for instance). However, if you’re saving and getting a nice condo-like room, that may not matter much to you.\n\nOf course Arbnb adds its share of fees that might not make booking this way much more appealing, but surely that will be a function of timing, prices and your needs in the given situation. It’s interesting at least to note that Airbnb is even an option for booking mainstream strip properties.\n\nOne major reason why I’m not big on Airbnb is something Gary notes: the danger of being completely out of luck when a host cancels on you at the last minute. That said, I’d generally be less concerned about that in Las Vegas versus other markets given the huge inventory of rooms that I can’t imagine will be terribly full any time in the near-term. I’d be confident that I’d find some sort of backup plan if the reservation fell through, which might make me more apt to take advantage of this Airbnb option if price and room type dictated that it was the right deal for me.\n\nOf course, I’m more likely to book Delano via Chase’s Luxury Hotel Collection given great rates, an all-suite property, and the standard free-breakfast and $100 resort fee benefits of LHC. That has become my go-to play for Las Vegas stays and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future — whenever it is that I get back to Las Vegas again.\n\nThe living room of a standard suite at Delano, which is by far my preferred Las Vegas Strip property given the combination of value and comfort.\n\nThe post Book some Las Vegas strip hotels via Airbnb appeared first on Frequent Miler.\n",

Scouting reports were compiled with information provided by industry sources as well as my own observations. As there was no minor league season in 2020, there are some instances where no new information was gleaned about a player. Players whose write-ups have not been altered begin by telling you so. For the others, the blurb ends with an indication of where the player played in 2020, which in turn likely informed the changes to their report. As always, I’ve leaned more heavily on sources from outside the org than within for reasons of objectivity. Because outside scouts were not allowed at the alternate sites, I’ve primarily focused on data from there. Ltommyastly, in effort to more clearly indicate relievers’ anticipated roles, you’ll see two reliever designations, both in lists and on The Board: MIRP, or multi-inning relief pitcher, and SIRP, or single-inning relief pitcher.\n\nFor more information on the 20-80 scouting scale by which all of our prospect content is governed, you can click here.

He hit .259/.394/.444 in the spring off of admittedly diluted pitching, then grinded out long, tough at-bats during the summer tune-up against a staff that would turn out to be quite good. He’s also one of the more decorated college hitters ever, slashing .374/.495/.688 at Cal.\n\nHe’s very likely to clear the high offensive bar at first base. He’s not a great feet-and-hands athlete on the infield but Vaughn’s swing is pretty athletic, and sweet. He doesn’t chase and seems to have a narrow early-count approach focused on pitches he can crush. He’s less able to damage well-executed breaking stuff away from him, but he often spoils those pitches or puts them in play and, again, typically doesn’t offer at them until he has to. There’s a clearer path to the big leagues for Vaughn now that Edwin Encarnacion and Nomar Mazara are no longer on the roster (I talk more about this in the System Overview), and he’ll likely play in the big leagues in 2021. He continues to project as an All-Star first baseman. (Alternate site)\n\n55 FV Prospects\n\n2. Michael Kopech, SP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2014 from Mt.

The surgery’s timing meant Kopech lost all of the 2019 regular season and began rehabbing in a game environment during Fall Instructional League. His first bolt was 99 mph. He settled in at 96-99, and threw several plus sliders. Kopech made his spring 2020 debut on March 10 and threw 11 pitches, six of which were 100 mph or more. It was his only inning of 2020, as Spring Training was shut down soon after, and Kopech would later opt out of the season amid the pandemic and other meaningful off-field considerations. As such, his evaluation is the same.\n\nKopech’s trademark heat and slider give him late-inning potential even if he can’t start, an outcome that seems more likely during the early part of his big league career now that he’s missed two seasons and may take time to build up an innings load. He’ll be able to start if he can command that slider to the back foot of left-handed hitters; he needs to have an out-pitch against lefties and some sort of viable third pitch, which I think will more likely be a second breaking ball than a split or a changeup. If he can do that, I think he’s a 3-to-4 WAR starter. (At-home dev)\n\n3.

After posting the lowest swinging strike rate in all of the minor leagues in 2019, he had the third-lowest swinging strike rate in the big leagues in 2020 at 3.3%. The players who surround him on that leaderboard — Luis Arraez, Eric Sogard, and David Fletcher — are all similar offensive players who make elite rates of contact but have almost no power. More precisely, Madrigal is most like Arraez because of how opposite-field oriented their contact is. If you prorate Fletcher and Arraez’s performance over the past few years, they’re pretty well above-average players, and Madrigal is a better defensive player than Arraez and is a wash with Fletcher at second. I just think this reinforces the industry’s long-standing eyeball evaluation that even though he’s quite small and is not going to hit for power, Madrigal is a very good player.

(Major league teams were skeptical of that explanation and thought his absence had to do with an off-the-field matter.) In that lone appearance this spring, Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 with his fastball while flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams valued him leading up to the draft (the relief risk, the injury or makeup issues) was highly variable. Their confidence seemed to be determined by who in the org had seen him and when (many teams weren’t able to get a decision-maker to see him in person in 2020), but those that focused on his pitch data, which was shared among all the teams, thought he had among the best raw stuff in the entire draft class and was one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen. Crochet was also among the high-octane college pitchers thought capable of going straight to the big leagues in a relief role, something more broadly considered by clubs due to the structure of the 2020 player pool. Out of Burl Carraway, Clayton Beeter, etc., only Crochet actually did.\n\nAfter he tuned up at the alternate site for about two months, Crochet was added to the 40-man and sent to the big leagues in mid-September. He pitched six innings in five relief appearances, walked no one (though he was pretty wild if you put on the tape), allowed just three hits and no runs, and struck out eight big leaguers. He made the White Sox playoff roster but left his first career postseason outing with a flexor strain, which ended his season. He’s healthy now, training and throwing at the team’s complex in Arizona. Because he barely threw in 2020, he’s likely to be on a strict innings limit in 2021. The club is going to try to thread the needle here and use Crochet in a relief role while still trying to develop him as a long-term starter. Players in this situation tend to wind up in the bullpen, and that’s where I have Crochet projected based on his strike-throwing limitations, independent of his shortened developmental timeline.

His curveball is occasionally average but more often is below, and as breaking ball spin is seen as an attribute a pitching prospect either has or doesn’t, the ceiling on that pitch is likely limited. If the curveball, or some other breaking ball, can become average, then Kelley can be a mid-rotation starter. If not, he has late-inning relief stuff. Kelley is also a bigger, heavier kid without a modicum of positive physical projection left unless you’re a proponent of “reverse projection,” where you project on a player based on the assumption that they’ll improve their conditioning in pro ball. This has happened with Forrest Whitley, Bo Bichette, and others. Even if this were to occur here, though, I’m not sure it will make a difference in the area of import, which for Kelley is his breaking ball quality.

Once parked in the 97-102 range, he was living 90-92 early on in the 2018 Fall League and was shut down with fatigue. In 2019, he was back in the 94-97 range, topping out at 99, then sat 96-99 and touched 100 during his 2020 big league debut. Burdi was knocked around in a limited major league jaunt and his velocity slowly declined (though always remained good) during that stretch. Just based on his — and perhaps unfairly, his brother’s — injury history, I think the industry will always value Burdi a little lower than his talent, which is that of a late-inning reliever.\n\nIt’s odd and perhaps a bit of a yellow flag that he was hit so hard in 2020, but I’m still betting on the combination of velocity and two good secondary pitches and project Burdi as a third bullpen banana. His slider is short and cuttery but it’s really hard, in the 88-92 mph range, and it has biting two-plane movement when it’s located right. His low-90s changeup also has bat-missing tail. All three pitches are capable of missing bats, Burdi just needs to execute more consistently. During his big league action this year, I noticed he’d alter his position on the rubber depending on the handedness of the opposing hitter. I don’t know how long Burdi has been doing that or if it’s a thing he’s yet comfortable with, so perhaps he experienced a learning/feel curve in 2020. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n7.

He was a good bit more physical than most of his peers in that league, listed at a sturdy 6-foot-4, 215 pounds. But he was also a bit raw from a baseball standpoint though he still had success in general, and with his swing decisions in particular. He did not have the opportunity to come stateside until Fall Instructional League 2020 and his name is one of the first out of scouts’ mouths when you ask them about who they liked from Chicago’s Autumn group.\n\nHe has overt power projection because of his frame, though with the added strength and power comes a corner-only profile. Scouts talk about Bailey’s likely eventual size as if he’s going to be built like Franmil Reyes, so there’s a chance he flirts with a DH-only defensive outcome. Regardless of whether he ends up in an outfield corner or without a real position, Bailey is going to have to hit. For a long-levered player who has less in-game experience than most who are the age of a college freshman, Bailey’s feel for the barrel is pretty good. He’s now had success against both same-aged but more experienced players in the DSL and against an Instructional League pitching pool that was unusually advanced due to a lack of minor league season. Without a valuable defensive role to fall back on, Bailey is a high-variance prospect who’ll either hit enough to play every day or not. He’s one of few prospects in the system who has that sort of ceiling at all and his bat-to-ball skills are better than all of the others. Were he a domestic prospect, Bailey would be the sort who goes in the third round of the draft. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n8.

He manipulates the bat head’s depth and direction to get the sweet spot to pitches all over the zone. He loads his hands pretty deep, but because he’s such a short-levered guy, Rodriguez is still able to catch velocity despite this. He’s clearly gotten stronger and twitchier during the last year and showed up to Fall Instructional League looking more muscular and mature than in 2019. I think he’s an athletic fit on the middle infield though he perhaps doesn’t have quiet the arm for shortstop. That may have come with the added strength but I did not see this group in the Fall. I’d like to see him be more selective, but the combination of feel to hit and defensive projection give Sanchez a shot to be a consistent, role-playing middle infielder of some kind. He has an outside shot at being a regular if he can continue to become more physical. The trajectory he’s on in this regard has already surpassed what I expected after seeing him in the AZL last year. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n9.

He was assigned to Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League just before the initial publication of Chicago’s list but hasn’t played enough there to justify re-evaluation, so his report remains the same. Adolfo has been around for so long that even though he’s missed a lot of time due to injury, we have a pretty good idea of what he is. Here’s the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that same elbow, before being limited to the alt site for 2020. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 pounds) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they’d like him to play the outfield, he’s one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man.\n\nAdolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he’s had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he’s been a hedonistic free swinger. He’s run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well. He’s in the White Sox mix for a power bench bat and occasional DH. (Alternate site, LIDOM)\n\n40 FV Prospects\n\n10.

That variability has followed him into pro ball where, even during a fairly brief instructs run in the Fall, Thompson’s fastball was either up to 95 or 96, or living in the 90-92 range depending on when he was seen. (This was well after he was added to the 60-man player pool in early-August, so he’d had time to get ramped up for the Fall.) Perhaps mechanical changes, aiming to simplify Thompson’s delivery and make it more consistent, are at work; his delivery is super smooth but he didn’t repeat it consistently as an amateur. Regardless, he remains a good long-term pitching prospect who has enough physical projection left to allow us to dream on him routinely throwing hard. He just hasn’t had the opportunity to cut it loose and prove he can do it over a full season of pro starter’s innings yet. His FV remains the same as last year.

That’s mostly held true more than a year after he was drafted, except I saw more release point variability (as if to vary the shape of his breaking ball) and a longer arm action (which makes me less likely to project heavily on the changeup) than was described in my amateur notes. But again, Dalquist’s report remains similar to last offseason’s write-up. He’s well-balanced over the rubber and has advanced fastball and breaking ball control. He’ll likely end up with two viable breaking balls even if the changeup doesn’t develop, which will be fine for thwarting lefties so long as they’re located well, which they project to be. Because Dalquist is of narrow build, he doesn’t have the fastball projection of most other, recently-drafted pitchers (especially since he’s already 20) and projects toward the back of a rotation.

As the temperature climbed, so too did Stiever’s velocity, and he started pounding the zone with 92-95, peaking at 97. In a season split between Low- and Hi-A, Stiever struck out 154 hitters and walked just 27 in 145 innings and became one of the org’s better starting pitching prospects. Then he was shut down with forearm soreness toward the end of 2020’s original spring training and didn’t re-emerge until September, when the team called him up from the alternate site to make a few September starts, which was instructive because we got to see his velocity coming off of the forearm soreness that ended his spring. He sat 91-94, which is a little below his peak 2019 breakout when he would touch those 6’s and 7’s. His changeup looked better, though, and it was a stabilizing force during a jittery first start.\n\nHe’ll need to locate his slider more consistently for it to be effective, and the same goes for his heater if it’s going to live around 93 rather than well into the mid-90s. Stiever also incorporated his secondary stuff more often in his second outing. That’s probably the long-term strategy if this is where his fastball velocity is going to live, but both his breaking ball and fastball spin were down about 200 rpm each compared to the 2019 minor league data I have. Based on his 2020 look, Stiever is a 40 FV backend starter. If he reclaims his 2019 velocity, he’s a 45 FV, but that year is the one that, based on his career norms, appears to be the outlier right now. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n13.

He is also the most reliable defensive infielder of this group and I consider him likely to stay at third base, though it’s worth noting that there’s growing variability on both sides of that prediction, as the Sox have experimented with him at second, while one scout who saw him in the Fall think teenagers this size almost always move to first base or the outfield corners.\n\nIndeed, for his age, Ramos is already a sizable guy. Perhaps tricked by the way his fire engine red batting gloves stood out against Chicago’s black and gray instructs threads, I thought he had the most explosive hands of that group, and I like how bold his stride is, even though some of his swings are reckless. Ultimately, he’s a risky corner prospect a long way from the big leagues. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n14.

I wrote last year that Mercedes is built such that he looks ripped and fat at the same time, and if you’ve been watching him catch for Licey in the Dominican Winter League, you can see he’s begun to trend toward the latter. It doesn’t matter all that much though because, anticipated rule changes or not, he can’t catch, nor can he really play first base. Instead, his is a DH-only profile with serious strength, bat speed, and hand-eye coordination that might enable him to play a valuable situational role if he can overcome a propensity to chase. It’s not as if the Yermínator lacks any kind of approach. With two strikes, he ditches his huge leg kick and focuses on putting the ball in play with just his hands and wrists, and he often still hits the ball hard like this because he’s so strong.\n\nPerhaps he’ll have some trade value once baseball moves to a universal designated hitter but I tend to think Mercedes’ epicurean sensibilities at the plate would undermine his ability to play every day. Instead, I think if he’s deployed in situations where the opposing pitcher can’t pitch around him and has to throw strikes, he’ll be a very, very dangerous late-game hitter. How the org decides to prioritize his opportunities versus Adolfo’s, Zack Collins‘ and others might be up to the new manager. (Alternate site, MLB (barely), LIDOM)\n\n15.

Both of their reports are unchanged. I prefer Gonzalez because I think his shorter swing enables him to make more consistent contact. He stands way off the dish, which creates some quality-of-contact limitations on pitches away from him in exchange for an ability to open up and turn on inside pitches with authority. It’s an approach that’s typically shiftable, but Gonzalez is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this. I think he has more big league utility than Rutherford because of these secondary skills, even though Rutherford has more power. (Alternate site)\n\n16.

Because he was only at the alt site all year, there’s really no way of knowing how this has gone. I’ve been watching Rutherford since his junior year of high school and he has always had a gorgeous low-ball swing that at times is suited for him slicing pitches away from him to the opposite field. I was as enamored with Rutherford’s swing and big frame during his prep days as anyone, but my thinking around swings like this has changed, even if Rutherford’s report hasn’t. I’ve never seen him really impact a ball that he hasn’t gotten fully extended on, and I don’t see a way of getting him to pull more without losing that that extension. Anecdotally, longer-swinged hitters seem to be better at hitting breaking balls and offspeed stuff than fastballs, and perhaps as baseball shifts toward a pitching approach that throws more breaking balls, hitters like Rutherford will actually be in a metagame position to succeed, but I’m skeptical. I still think the hopeful outcome here is for a lefty platoon bat. (Alternate site)\n\n17.

It meant having to scrutinize, and perhaps dismiss, Sanchez’ strong .297/.386/.441 line, while his underlying TrackMan data (a major league-average 88 mph mean exit velo, with only 25% of balls in play hit over 95 mph) reinforced the international scouting opinion that Sanchez is probably more of a utility player than a potential everyday guy due to a lack of power. The Fall Instructional League look in 2020, Sanchez’s first stateside action, was similar, though he has been strength training in Miami and is getting pretty big. We won’t know if that has yielded stock-boosting power in games until he hopefully faces age-appropriate competition in 2021. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n18.

In the Fall of 2020, he was also throwing harder: up from 89-92 and touching 94 in 2019, McClure was suddenly sitting 92-95 with a host of viable secondary pitches. He looks like a near-ready depth option and perhaps more if his velocity keeps climbing. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n19. Lenyn Sosa, 2B\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2016 from Venezuela (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n20.9\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 0″\n\nWeight\n\n180\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/55\n\n45/55\n\n30/45\n\n40/30\n\n30/40\n\n45\n\nI have mixed notes on Sosa’s athleticism and defensive ability, but I like the way his hands work in the box and think he has a good knack for finding the barrel even though he doesn’t have great bat speed, and hitting is the thing I care most about. He had two high-end contact seasons as a 17 and 18-year old in rookie ball (one aided by the Pioneer League’s hitting environment), then had a dud of a 2019 at age 19, then only saw instructs action this Fall. He’ll still be fairly young for Hi-A in 2021. I think he’ll ultimately be the sort of infielder who is only able to play second or third because of good positioning, but I’m interested in seeing what happens to the power output if Sosa trains and tries to hit with that in mind. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n20. Seby Zavala, C\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 12th Round, 2015 from San Diego State (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n27.3\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 0″\n\nWeight\n\n215\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/30\n\n55/55\n\n40/45\n\n30/30\n\n50/50\n\n50\n\nSeby spent the year at the alternate site and his report in unchanged, though it’s worth noting that the departure of James McCann and the defensive abilities of those left behind (aside from Yasmani Grandal) make it more likely that he sees big league time in 2021. He’s going to strike out a lot, so much that it will be detrimental to his offensive output relative to the average big leaguer, but that’s true of a lot of backup catchers. Zavala is a viable defensive catcher with above-average raw power, and I think he’d run into as many as 10 homers as a full-season backup. Where he sits amidst a crowded catching situation in Chicago depends on how the org views Mercedes and Collins defensively. He’s likely the third catcher during his option years and someone’s backup once those expire. (Alternate site)\n\n21. James Beard, CF\n\nDrafted: 4th Round, 2019 from Lloyd Star HS (MS) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n20.2\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 0″\n\nWeight\n\n190\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n20/40\n\n30/40\n\n20/35\n\n80/80\n\n40/70\n\n40\n\nBeard’s report is very similar to last year’s but I’ve upped his FV because while he’s as raw as many of the hitters in the 35+ FV tier, the probability that he remains at an up-the-middle defensive position should create some separation between him and the others. At the same time, this is the sort of player who the year away from seeing pro pitching probably hurts the most, and the kind of player who a shorter draft and a more limited number of minor league roster spots will also hurt. As a hitter, Beard is more like a five o’clock shadow, one of the least-experienced bats to appear on a team’s list this year. But of all the young hitters in this org, he has the greatest chance of staying up the middle because his speed almost guarantees he’ll stay in center field forever. He’s a half-decade dev project with the speed to be a leadoff pest. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n22. Tyler Johnson, SIRP\n\nDrafted: 5th Round, 2017 from South Carolina (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n25.3\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 3″\n\nWeight\n\n205\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n60/60\n\n55/55\n\n40/45\n\n30/40\n\n93-95 / 97\n\nJohnson spent the year at the alternate site (he was eventually added to the 40-man roster) and so his report is the same. Because Johnson was hurt for most of the pre-deadline part of the 2019 season he wasn’t widely seen until the Fall League, where he struggled to throw strikes. He is athletically built but doesn’t have an athletic delivery. He has a very casual, very terse stride that cuts him off and forces him to throw across his body. It’s weird and disorienting the first few times you see it, which makes the 93-95 fastballs Johnson throws catch you off guard. He’ll flash a plus breaking ball, but that was also inconsistent in Fall. He’s a 40 FV from a stuff and deception perspective, though industry feedback (the AFL look was bad) mostly had him in the tier beneath this one. (Alternate site)\n\n23. Gavin Sheets, 1B\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2017 from Wake Forest (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n24.7\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 4″\n\nWeight\n\n230\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n40\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n45/50\n\n70/70\n\n45/50\n\n30/30\n\n40/50\n\n40\n\nA player dev employee from a team that saw a lot of the Sox during the Fall echoed the thoughts I’ve had about Sheets’ swing basically since he was drafted: he too often slices down at the baseball, and he can only get to his considerable raw power in certain parts of the strike zone. He does have good bat control and makes mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, which he has the raw strength to punish even if the timing of his lower half has been compromised. He’s a good hitter, just one I’m skeptical will clear the offensive bar at first base without trading some contact for power, which hasn’t happened yet. He got some run in the outfield during Instructional League, and if he proves capable of playing there then he belongs up in the Gonzalez/Rutherford area. If you stand back and take a bird’s eye view of the profile, this is a 24-year-old who hasn’t slugged over .415 in pro ball yet and now occupies a 40-man spot on a club that has several other hitters just like him. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n35+ FV Prospects\n\n24. Hunter Schryver, SIRP\n\nDrafted: 7th Round, 2017 from Villanova (TBR)\n\nAge\n\n25.7\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 1″\n\nWeight\n\n205\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n60/60\n\n50/50\n\n45/55\n\n90-93 / 94\n\nSchryver was acquired in a small 2018 trade with the Rays then pushed to Double- and Triple-A during his first full season with the Pale Hose, pitching well in Birmingham but not in Charlotte. He was a 2020 non-roster invitee but blew out and needed Tommy John in February, missing the entire season. And yet there was some light industry buzz that he was being talked about as a Rule 5 Draft sleeper because Schyver’s pitch data is superlative in a specific way. Namely, his release point is really, really high (top 20 among minor league lefties in 2019) and yet, because he doesn’t take much of a stride down the mound, his extension is just a shade over five feet, which is very low. His release point is unique due to this combination, and it creates really weird angle on his fastball, which spins a lot relative to its velocity. Conversely, his slider has almost no spin. It’s weird. He’s a sleeper who I expect will be at least an up/down option year reliever. (Injury)\n\n25. Caleb Freeman, SIRP\n\nDrafted: 15th Round, 2019 from Texas Tech (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n22.8\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 1″\n\nWeight\n\n190\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n55/60\n\n55/60\n\n30/35\n\n92-95 / 97\n\nThere are several Texas Tech relievers who recently entered pro ball with crude arm strength only to suddenly become more interesting, which either indicates pro ball is optimizing something being missed in Lubbock, or that Tech is underscouted. Freeman only threw 16 innings during his junior year for the Red Raiders, and they weren’t very good (he walked 15 guys). After he signed, though, he was excellent. He sat 92-95 and touched 97 in rookie ball and flashed a plus breaking ball. The pandemic made it tough for pro dev take-a-leap guys everywhere to break out. Freeman was working with two different breaking balls in the Fall, but he was a little wild again and he may always be, as his arm action is long. But I’ve got an up/down relief grade on him, which is a good find in round 15. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n26. Lency Delgado, 3B\n\nDrafted: 4th Round, 2018 from Doral Academy Prep (FL) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n21.5\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 3″\n\nWeight\n\n215\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/40\n\n50/55\n\n30/50\n\n50/45\n\n40/50\n\n60\n\nThis applies to Delgado, and Bush, and Gladney behind him: Delgado stands out in his uniform (he’s built like a top-heavy college linebacker, bigger and faster than a lot of same-aged college players in this year’s draft) and is a really explosive guy with considerable raw power. He has a bad approach that limits both the quality and amount of contact he makes. He could really have used a full season of at-bats to try to nurture that, but instead saw pitching that was a stretch for him in the Fall. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n27. Jimmy Lambert, SIRP\n\nDrafted: 5th Round, 2016 from Fresno State (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n26.1\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 2″\n\nWeight\n\n170\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n45/50\n\n50/55\n\n50/55\n\n50/55\n\n45/50\n\n91-94 / 95\n\nLambert’s strikeout rate exploded from 16% in 2017 to nearly 29% in 2018. The cause? A slight uptick in velocity paired with an arm slot change that has him coming straight over the top, creating more life on his heater; it also creates more vertical action on his breaking stuff. This delivery appears tough to maintain, as Lambert has to contort his body to get to that slot, but he hasn’t been wild since making the change. In 2019, he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John in June. I assumed that would cost him all of 2020, but he went to the Sox alternate site and actually made his big league debut in July of 2020. After just two outings, though, he was again shut down with a forearm strain and put on the 60-day IL. (For The Board, I’m using pitch data I have from 2019 rather than what he generated in a two-inning, perhaps somewhat injured big league sample in 2020.) I still have him projected in an up/down relief role eventually. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n28. Bailey Horn, MIRP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 5th Round, 2020 from Auburn (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n22.9\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 2″\n\nWeight\n\n217\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCurveball\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n50/50\n\n50/50\n\n50/55\n\n40/45\n\n90-93 / 96\n\nMy notes on Horn’s Fall exploits aren’t great; a scout told me his fastball was very hittable in the outing they saw. But he had been a consistent “arrow-up” prospect throughout the previous year and a half. He had surgery while at junior college then pitched out of the Auburn bullpen as a draft-eligible sophomore, and his velo climbed the further away from the surgery he got. Horn won a rotation spot in the Fall of 2019 then came out touching 96 as a junior and had four really good starts before the shut down. He’s another up/down relief prospect with two quality breaking balls and could probably stand to use the curveball as a strike-one pitch more than he did in college. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n29. Bryce Bush, RF\n\nDrafted: 33rd Round, 2018 from De La Salle Collegiate HS (MI) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n21.0\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 0″\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/35\n\n55/60\n\n35/55\n\n50/45\n\n30/35\n\n50\n\nA late-round, cold-weather high school flier who signed for $290,000, Bush played in some of the big prep showcases during his final amateur summer and was clearly overmatched against the better pitching. But he put on an absolute show during batting practice and has one of the best raw power projections among potential future Sox. He had a strong pro debut on paper and continued to look good with the bat during the spring of 2019, then struggled during the summer. The general scouting consensus is that Bush will not stay at his current third base and will have to move to an outfield corner or to first, which immediately makes his whiffs troublesome. He’s a high-risk, long-term developmental prospect with some of the louder offensive tools in the system. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n30. DJ Gladney, 3B\n\nDrafted: 16th Round, 2019 from Illiana Christian HS (IL) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n19.4\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 3″\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n20/40\n\n50/60\n\n25/55\n\n40/40\n\n30/40\n\n50\n\nI reposting last year’s comment because I still think it’s relevant: Gladney presents an interesting case for splitting actual age away from other Traits of Maturity in draft models, since he was young for the class in both age and reps (another possible Trait of Maturity), but not physically (a third). He’s a strong guy who strides way open as he tries to pull everything with power, an all-or-nothing approach. Like Bryce Bush before him, Gladney will be tried at third base for a while but may not stay there. He’s a high risk corner power prospect. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n31. Luis Mieses, CF\n\nVideo\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2016 from Dominican Republic (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n20.6\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 3″\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/55\n\n50/55\n\n20/50\n\n45/40\n\n45/45\n\n45\n\nPerhaps it’s damning that Mieses was not invited to receive fall instruction in the U.S. but since I have no new information here, good or bad, he remains at the back of the list as a huge-framed young player with rare feel for contact for such a long-limbed hitter. Like others in the system, his approach is bad and could be his undoing. (At-home dev)\n\n32. Jake Burger, 1B\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2017 from Missouri State (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n24.7\n\nHeight\n\n6′ 2″\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/50\n\n60/60\n\n40/55\n\n30/30\n\n40/45\n\n60\n\nBecause of the pandemic, Burger was facing a third consecutive season without regular reps following two lost to a myriad of severe heel injuries (including two Achilles ruptures) and instead played for the Normal CornBelters in a makeshift league put together after COVID squashed the usual summer wood bat festivities in the Midwest. Burger’s play and Chicago’s late-summer 60-man pool space enabled them to roster him at the alternate site toward the end of the season before he went to instructs in the Fall.\n\nHe’s leaner and more mobile than scouts anticipated, evidence of the work he put in during his unthinkable series of misfortunes. The Sox added him to the 40-man in November. While his story of perseverance is remarkable, and all of baseball is rooting for the guy, who seems like an affable and funny young man, he’s unlikely to make a long-term big league impact. I was on the low end of projecting Burger while he was in college, skeptical of his ability to play third even before all the injuries. Now, his swing path is also a bit of an issue. He should be given an opportunity to claim that bench power bat spot but I think others in the org are more likely to do so. (CarShield Collegiate League, alternate site, Fall Instructional League)\n\nOther Prospects of Note\n\nCatching Depth (and Remillard)\nCarlos Perez, C\nGunnar Troutwine, C\nRicardo Aguilar, C\nZach Remillard, SS\n\nPerez, 23, has good bat-to-ball skills and arm strength but little power. He might be a third catcher. Troutwine is a tough dude with great feel for the strike zone. Aguilar just signed. He’s a converted infielder with a compact frame and contact-oriented approach. Remillard is upper-level depth capable of playing almost every position on the field.\n\nHigh Probability Depth Arms\nKonnor Pilkington, LHP\nAndrew Perez, LHP\nVince Arobio, RHP\nBernardo Flores Jr., LHP\n\nAll of these pitchers are in their mid-20s. Pilkington is an SEC college performance prospect with below average stuff. He’s a sixth starter type. Perez needs to find a breaking ball, but he will touch 95 from the left side and his changeup is plus. Arobio has a high spin, backspinning fastball, too, but his angle is more downhill. He has the best breaking ball of this group. Flores is a four-pitch lefty with good breaking stuff and a 40 fastball.\n\nYounger, Raw Pitching\nFrander Veras, RHP\nDavis Martin, RHP\nYoelvin Silven, RHP\nMcKinley Moore, RHP\nAdisyn Coffey, RHP/3B\nRonaldo Guzman, LHP\n\nVeras is 21 and spent 2019, his first pro season, in the DSL. He was up to 96 there and his changeup has late sinking action at times. Martin is another good Day 3 pick out of Texas Tech. He sits 89-94 and has a plus slider. Silven was up to 95 as a 19-year-old in 2019, and sitting 93 and touching 96 late in 2020. His secondary stuff is below average and the Sox are tinkering with a couple different breaking balls there. Moore is an arm strength-only prospect who actually threw strikes pretty consistently during instructs, which he needs to continue doing as he climbs the ladder. He’s up to 98. Coffey was the team’s underslot 2020 signee so they could fit Kelley into their bonus pool. He was a high school infielder once committed to ASU, ended up at a Midwest JUCO and moved to the mound. He’s been 93-95 in spurts but had a Tommy John two months ago and is now taking BP and groundballs. Guzman is a small-ish 18-year-old lefty who was the youngest player on the Instructional League roster. He struck out a lot of DSL hitters in 2019 even though he only threw in the mid-80s because his fastball has big carry. He’s now into the upper-80s and will have an impact fastball if he can keep throwing harder.\n\nSystem Overview\n\nThe White Sox have graduated top prospects several years running, and their 2020 group was particularly strong. Especially now that they’re pushing in their chips and trading prospects for current big leaguers (Dane Dunning would have been in the 50 FV tier, while Avery Weems would be toward the top of the 40s), this group is starting to thin a little bit, and this list may be artificially deep because I’ve kept some of the young hellion hitting prospects alive here. It’s likely a couple of the toolsy scratch-offs toward the bottom of the list would have struggled during a 2020 season and fallen off, but it’s also possible one or two of them would have broken out in a meaningful way, although I suppose Bailey did during the Fall and that stretch also reinforced the notion that Rodriguez might have a special bat. It’s especially important to this org that the draft be as many rounds as the owners can stomach to fill in some depth at the bottom of the system.\n\nIt’s notable that even the really good prospects in this system have very aggressive approaches, often so aggressive that it undermines their ability to hit. I think virtual reality training would be an interesting fit for this org. The concept of it makes sense: show your hitters dozens of pitches per day, from VR big league pitching, and try to develop pitch recognition skills without needing to have a pitcher there. Some orgs have tried it and seen promising early results but the pandemic wiped out another season to evaluate if it was working.\n\nThe White Sox did not appear to opt in to Fall data sharing with the rest of baseball, as I asked multiple sources to check on some objective information for this list and they found nothing from instructs in their system. Because this is one of the orgs I did not see myself in the Fall, alterations to this list were largely derived from the opinions of scouts I spoke to who saw ball at Camelback Ranch and whatever was gleaned from players’ big league performance.\n",

The facts about deficit financing should be front and center of the White House and Congress.\n\nIts the Debt servicing costs, stupid — not total debt.\n\nConsider in 2000, when the US federal debt was 34% of GDP, relatively close to its post-war low. By the end of 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio will have nearly tripled to over 100% of GDP. At the same time, the cost of servicing this larger debt has fallen, relative to the size of the economy, because of the widespread fall in interest rates across advanced economies. As a share of GDP, the cost of servicing US debt has fallen since 2000, even though federal debt has increased.\n\nThe Peterson Institute has observed:\n\n“This situation also creates more space for primary deficits (noninterest spending minus revenue) without resulting in an unlimited explosion of debt. Rather than focus on the size of US debt, policymakers should assess fiscal capacity in terms of real interest payments, ensuring they remain comfortably below 2 percent of GDP. By this measure, there is room for substantial additional fiscal support and needed public investments while maintaining a sustainable public debt.” (adapted from Jason Furman and Lawrence H. Summers’ working paper, “A Reconsideration of Fiscal Policy in the Era of Low Interest Rates)\n\nI will be watching to see if this argument carries with the faux deficit hawks.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPreviously:\nCan We Please Have an Honest Debate About Tax Policy?

But since we can’t do that this year, we’re trying to reimagine the usual gatherings and traditions—the same way we’ve already reimagined work, school, birthdays and other holidays.\n\nI’ve been thinking back to how we coped with lockdown in March and April, and using that to figure out how to close out the year. Like every other family with small children, I am not entirely sure how I managed it—and let’s be honest, most of the time I relied on pure survival tactics. But I also developed a range of new hacks and skills, making use of a few practical Google products. As we prepare to do it all again, with shorter days and colder weather, these are some of the lessons I’ll take with me:\n\nStorytime Hour with Granny comes with a free printout to color with each story.\n\nNear or far, loved ones can be close\n\nSo many families are dispersed across the globe. I live in the UK, but I’m originally from South Africa, and my family still resides there. I haven’t ever experienced what it’s like to have parents living nearby, but somehow during lockdown the thing I needed most was to have my mum there to lend a hand with the kids or just pop in for a cup of tea. My children were not in school, and I was managing a large project at work. To add insult to injury, my kids also openly admitted that my storytelling was just not up to scratch during our daily school lessons, and that they’d prefer to “hear from Granny, because she does the funny voices.”\n\nNecessity being the mother of invention, “Storytime Hour with Granny” was born. \n\nWe began a tradition of setting up a Google Meet every afternoon, so she could read a story to her grandchildren for an hour. We set up the call in Google Calendar, where it was easy for her to simply click on the Meet link, and for one precious hour, my children were transported to another place, mesmerized by old storybooks. (And I transported myself to my home office for some less mesmerizing but blessedly uninterrupted focus time while listening to questionable music and sipping coffee that wasn’t cold, for a change.)\n\nSometimes you need to consult the biscuit instructors. Yes, that is a job. \n\nCreate a class\n\nAs much as my kids loved the connection with their grandmother, they also needed to connect with their friends. My son is in his third year of primary school, so he’s not old enough to socialize virtually on his own. So I set up a weekly “class assembly” where he could connect with his peers, say hello and spend most of the hour pulling faces at each other. Using Google Meet on my laptop meant we could see all 30 kids and their parents joining from their homes. (Even if, at times, the camera was pointed towards the ceiling or only the top of a child’s head.) \n\nEach week we picked a different topic to talk about. When it was my turn, I hosted a banana bread-making class, where I asked the Google Assistant to pull up a simple recipe from YouTube that we could all follow easily. As a backup, the Google Assistant can quickly provide answers to questions such as “How many tablespoons is one cup?” (It was also helpful with the many other fundamental questions lockdown brings, such as “How many blues are there in the world?” and “What does a peregrine falcon sound like?” among others I needed reminding of, such as what day of the week it was.)\n\nBesides all the helpful features, Nest Hub Max can display a seemingly infinite carousel of photos.\n\nShare and display your photos \n\nAs my parents live far away, this year I have decided to gift them a Nest Hub Max for Christmas. I know my mum will keep it in the kitchen, which means she can watch YouTube videos, stream Netflix content, listen to music and make video calls on Google Duo, all while she’s preparing meals or having tea. It also means my parents won’t need to set up their laptop for Storytime Hour anymore; they can just dial in straight from this nifty device. \n\nBut the thing I’m most excited about is the Nest Hub Max’s photo frame feature. All grandparents love photos, but they seem to have taken on new significance in the absence of face-to-face visits—even the not-so-photogenic ones (and like many families who take photos on the fly, we have plenty of those action shots). And now my children won’t have to say, “Take a picture! Don’t forget to send it to Granny! Did you send it to Granny? You forgot, didn’t you?” Soon they’ll be able to automatically see and enjoy those moments in a shared photo album from Google Photos shown on the display, whether it’s that vacation we took to Croatia pre-lockdown, or a macro close-up of my daughter’s forehead. To enable this, all you need to do is set up the Nest Hub photo frame feature.\n\n“That’s a really great photo of your arm...or is that my arm?”\n\nHelp with bedtime\n\nWhen the days slip into more days that feel exactly the same as all the other days, creating a set daily schedule—especially for bedtime—has been key to helping my children settle down. I set up a Routine using the Google Assistant on a Google Nest Mini in the kids’ room. As they’re getting into their pajamas and bouncing off the walls, I say the command that, frankly, Mary Poppins would’ve been grateful for: \"Hey Google, bedtime.\" I’m given tomorrow’s weather forecast (informing us, almost always, that we’ll need to pack an umbrella) and any scheduled calendar events. It then sets an alarm for the morning and dims the lights, ready for story time. To help them nod off, it also plays relaxing sounds, turning the noise off automatically after an hour when they are hopefully sound asleep. This has really helped them adjust to their own rhythm at home, even if it doesn’t always go to plan—which, let’s be honest, is at least 50 percent of the time. But at least the chaos is accompanied by the lulling background noise of crashing waves.\n",

          "description": "Photos: Getty Images, Photoillustration: Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\nYou can save lives with your giving. Here’s how.\n\nGiving to charity is great, not just for the recipients but for the givers, too.\n\nBut it can be intimidating to know how to pick the best charity, especially when there are thousands of worthy causes to choose from, and especially when the world’s in the midst of a massive pandemic and economic calamity that’s causing huge pain and suffering at home and abroad. These past few months, we’ve written on how to think through where to give and how to help address our rolling crises.\n\nAs we approach Giving Tuesday, I thought it might be helpful to update our annual guide to giving. Think of this not just as a rundown of charity recommendations, but as a broader guide to thinking about how to give. Here are a few simple tips for Giving Tuesday 2020 that can help.\n\n1) Check in with charity recommenders\n\nIt's of course possible to research charity options yourself, but it's probably better to outsource that labor to a careful, methodologically rigorous charity recommender like GiveWell. (Charity Navigator and Guidestar by Candid can be useful resources too, but they have traditionally avoided ranking charities or assessing which do the most good for the lowest cost. Charity Navigator is taking some initial steps to attempt the latter, however.)\n\nGiveWell currently lists nine top charities. Its recommendation, if you find it hard to choose among the nine, is to donate to the GiveWell Maximum Impact Fund, which goes directly to their top charities based on GiveWell’s assessment of where the money is most helpful given groups’ funding needs.\n\n“Basically, it’s the best way for a donor to take advantage of our up-to-date research, as we’re continually assessing and reprioritizing our top charities’ needs,” GiveWell research analyst Catherine Hollander told me. “We also think it’s a great fit for recurring donors since it allows each future gift to be used to support the highest-value projects we can find at that time.”\n\nMalaria Consortium, which helps distribute preventative antimalarial medication to children (a program known as “seasonal malaria chemoprevention”)\n\nAgainst Malaria Foundation, which buys and distributes insecticidal bed nets, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa but also in Papua New Guinea\n\nHelen Keller International, which provides technical assistance to, advocates for, and funds vitamin A supplementation programs in sub-Saharan Africa, which reduce child mortality\n\nNew Incentives, which offers cash to families in Nigeria conditional on childhood vaccinations\n\nEvidence Action’s Deworm the World Initiative, The END Fund, Sightsavers, and SCI Foundation, which all work on deworming programs to prevent parasitic infections.\n\nGiveDirectly, which directly distributes donations to poor people in Kenya and Uganda, to spend as they see fit.\n\nGiveWell chose those charities based on how much good additional donations would do, not necessarily how good the groups are overall; in other words, these are organizations that can put new funding to use, rather than sitting on it.\n\nGiveWell takes that factor seriously. In 2013, it revoked its recommendation of Against Malaria on the grounds that the charity had not spent enough of the money it already raised. In 2014, GiveWell judged that Against Malaria once again had room for more funding, and restored it on the recommendation list. So you can expect Against Malaria, and the other recommended charities, to spend anything you donate effectively and reasonably promptly.\n\nThe group also takes disconfirming research seriously. In 2017, it recommended Evidence Action’s No Lean Season, which offers no-interest loans to farmers in Bangladesh during the “lean season” between planting rice and harvesting it; the loans are conditional on a family member temporarily moving to a city or other area for short-term work. But a subsequent randomized evaluation found that the program didn’t actually spur people to migrate or increase their incomes, and GiveWell and Evidence Action then agreed that it should no longer be a top charity; Evidence Action stopped soliciting funds for it and later shut it down.\n\n(Disclosure: GiveWell is an advertiser on Vox podcasts; I was an admirer and follower of their work well before Vox existed, and their advertising plays no part in these recommendations.)\n\n2) Pick charities with research-based strategies\n\nGiveWell's recommendations rely heavily on both evaluations done by charitable organizations and existing research literature on the kind of intervention the charities are trying to conduct.\n\nFor example, its recommendations of SCI, Sightsavers, the END Fund, and Deworm the World are based on research suggesting that providing children with deworming treatments could improve educational, economic, and other outcomes.\n\nResearch from the Poverty Action Lab at MIT suggests that giving away insecticidal bednets — as the Against Malaria Foundation does — is vastly more effective than charging even small amounts for them.\n\nAnd while cash certainly has its limits, hundreds of studies have found largely positive effects for the kind of cash transfers that GiveDirectly distributes.\n\n3) If you want to maximize your donation’s impact, give abroad\n\n Against Malaria Foundation\n\nWomen in Dedza, Malawi, carry antimalarial bednets.\n\nIt's really hard to adequately express how much richer developed nations like the US are than developing ones like Kenya, Uganda, and other countries targeted by GiveWell's most effective charities.\n\nWe still have extreme poverty, in the living-on-$2-a-day sense, but it's comparatively pretty rare and hard to target effectively. The poorest Americans also have access to health care and education systems that, while obviously inferior compared to rich Americans, are far superior to those of developing countries. Giving to charities domestically is admirable, of course, but if you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of saving lives, reducing illness, or improving overall well-being, you're going to want to give abroad.\n\nYears ago, GiveWell actually looked into a number of US charities, like the Nurse-Family Partnership program for infants, the KIPP chain of charter schools, and the HOPE job-training program. It found that all were highly effective but were far more cost-intensive than the best foreign charities. KIPP and the Nurse-Family Partnership cost more than $10,000 per child served, while deworming programs like SCI's and Deworm the World's generally cost between $0.25 and $1 per child treated.\n\nThis is true even as the US is going through a historically brutal pandemic. The rest of the world is, too, and the disease and lockdowns it sparked have had especially devastating effects on poor countries, to the extent that 2020 was likely the first year in decades when global poverty increased. The pandemic has also taxed health systems in low-income countries, putting pressure on programs designed to fend off other diseases like malaria. Donations to anti-malaria, anti-worm, (non-Covid) vaccination, and Vitamin A supplementation programs like the ones recommended by GiveWell can help cushion that blow.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider giving to non-humans. Animal charities, especially those engaged in corporate pressure campaigns to better the treatment of farm animals, chickens in particular, can be effective in improving animal welfare. The charity evaluations in this area are much younger and less methodologically rigorous than GiveWell's, but Animal Charity Evaluators has named four animal groups that may be effective causes for donations:\n\nThe Humane League specializes in corporate campaigns to improve farm standards. It has achieved big victories in eliminating the culling of baby chicks and getting food service companies like Kroger and Sodexo to only use cage-free eggs, and is now pushing for better standards for chickens raised for their meat.\n\nThe Good Food Institute promotes plant-based and cultured meat alternatives to animal-based foods.\n\nThe Albert Schweitzer Foundation conducts corporate campaigns in Germany and Poland and is unusual in advocating for farmed fish as well as chickens and mammals.\n\nWild Animal Initiative, which studies the lived experience of animals living in the wild and researches ways to ease their suffering\n\n4) If you do give locally, you can still consider impact\n\nFor years I would advocate to friends that they donate abroad, or to animal-specific charities, since their donation was likelier to have a concrete near-term impact there than in a human-based US charity, given how much money it costs to meaningfully help a resident of a rich country.\n\nBut I usually got a lot of pushback. People want to give to their specific communities, or particular causes they’re passionate about for personal reasons (like curing a disease that killed a loved one, for instance). And they often want to use charity as a way to connect with broader trends in the news — by, say, donating to help provide representation for immigrant children on the US-Mexico border.\n\nFor years I didn’t have much to say to that, other than to add that it’s of course fine to give to your community and personal causes; this guide is mostly meant to offer alternate suggestions if you don’t have existing philanthropic interests and are curious for ways to help.\n\nBut a lot has happened in 2019 and 2020 to make donations of that kind easier. In 2019, the group ImpactMatters, co-founded by social entrepreneur Elijah Goldberg and economist Dean Karlan, launched, and attempted to quantify the bang-for-the-buck provided by charities in several sectors. But whereas GiveWell is pretty opinionated about cause areas — it pushes hard toward charities that save lives or dramatically improve financial well-being — ImpactMatters isn’t. ImpactMatters has since been acquired by Charity Navigator, which has begun incorporating ImpactMatters’ methodology into its own charity profiles.\n\nSo you can specify that your goal is, say, to provide a night of shelter for a person experiencing homelessness, and Charity Navigator/ImpactMatters will provide you with a menu of nonprofits and their cost-per-night-of-housing. Fellowship Deliverance Ministries in Georgia, for instance, is estimated to provide a night of shelter for $2 per person. You can also narrow down by where you want to give: Here’s a list of San Francisco-specific charities that ImpactMatters compiled, for instance.\n\nImpactMatters is barely over a year old and its incarnation as part of Charity Navigator is even younger. Its premiere sparked a bit of concern in some corners of the philanthropy world. Julia Coffman, director of the Center for Evaluation Innovation, had a thoughtful critique on Twitter, arguing that trying to quantify impact like this is “too reductionist” and that “cost-effectiveness in relation to impact penalizes orgs that expend $ addressing systemic and structural factors that affect both their clients’ needs and their ability to deliver services in a cost-effective way.”\n\nThat’s fair — giving for societal change is really hard to do and even harder to evaluate. The causal inference behind Charity Navigator and ImpactMatters’ estimates is also necessarily limited; they can’t run whole experiments to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of every single charity, so instead they build detailed models to try to approximate an estimate of each charity’s impact (here’s their methodology for emergency shelters for people experiencing homelessness, for instance).\n\nThese are productive conversations to be having that can inform the future of giving. In the meantime, for a certain set of donors, Charity Navigator and ImpactMatters offer a useful tool that might point them in the direction of nonprofits they hadn’t known about previously, and which are doing good in their specific areas.\n\n5) Consider meta-charities\n\nAnother option is giving to groups like GiveWell, Innovations for Poverty Action, the Life You Can Save, Giving What We Can, and 80,000 Hours that evaluate development approaches/charities and encourage effective giving. Suppose that every dollar given to Giving What We Can — which encourages people to pledge to donate at least 10 percent of their income until retirement — results in $1.20 in donations to the Against Malaria Foundation. If that's the case, then you should give to Giving What We Can until the marginal effect on donations to Against Malaria hits $1 or lower.\n\n\"If they can turn a dollar of donations into substantially more than a dollar of increased donations to effective charities, isn't that the best use of my money?\" asks Jeff Kaufman, a software developer who with his wife, the fantastic effective altruism activist and organizer Julia Wise, gives about half his income to effective charities and meta-charities.\n\n6) Saving lives isn't everything\n\n Stephen Davies/Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\n\nTwo Schistosoma mansoni, one of the parasites that causes schistosomiasis (which SCI combats). Schistosomiasis is not usually lethal, but it can permanently harm children’s development and growth.\n\nIf you only care about reducing early mortality and giving people more years to live, then you should give all your donations to the Malaria Consortium, Helen Keller International or the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is a frequently fatal disease, and cost-effective interventions to reduce malaria infection are a great way to save lives. Similarly, Vitamin A supplementation, like HKI does, is an effective way of reducing child mortality, as is vaccination (as promoted by New Incentives).\n\nBut the rest of the charities GiveWell recommends don't mainly focus on reducing mortality. Quality of life matters, too. Parasitic infections hamper children's development and education, which can have negative consequences lasting decades. Having increased access to cash may not extend the life of a GiveDirectly recipient, but it does make life considerably more pleasant.\n\n7) Don't give to a big charity\n\nYou'll notice that all of the charities GiveWell recommends are reasonably small, and some big names are absent. That's not an accident. In general, charity effectiveness evaluators are skeptical of large relief organizations, for a number of reasons.\n\nLarge organizations tend to be less transparent about where their money goes and also likelier to direct money to disaster relief efforts, which are usually less cost-effective, in general, than public health programs. \"Overall, our impression is that your donation to these organizations is very hard to trace, but will likely supplement an agenda of extremely diverse programming, driven largely by governments and other very large funders,\" writes GiveWell co-founder Holden Karnofsky.\n\n8) Maybe just give money directly to poor people\n\n GiveDirectly\n\nGiveDirectly uses the M-PESA system for mobile cash transfers.\n\nFor years, one of my primary charities was GiveDirectly, which is the only cause outside public health to get GiveWell's top rating, and, to my knowledge, the only charity devoted to unconditional cash transfers. I gave to them partly because there's a large body of research on the benefits of cash transfers, which I find quite compelling.\n\n(I have ceased donating to them since Future Perfect started and instead give to GiveWell’s top charities bucket, as a way to avoid conflicts of interest as I write more about charity. I view the GiveWell option as equivalent to investing in index funds to avoid any bias as a business reporter.)\n\nBut I donated to GiveDirectly mostly because I didn’t trust myself to know what the world's poorest people need most. I've been profoundly lucky to never experience the kind of extreme poverty that billions of people worldwide have to endure. I have no idea what I would spend a cash transfer from GiveDirectly on if I were living on less than $2 a day in Uganda. Would I buy a bednet? Maybe! Or maybe I'd buy an iron roof. Or school tuition for loved ones. Or cattle.\n\nBut you know who does have a good sense of the needs of poor people in Uganda? Poor people in Uganda. They have a very good idea of what they need. Do they sometimes misjudge their spending priorities? Certainly; so do we all. And bednets and deworming treatments appear to be underpurchased relative to the actual need for them. But generally, you should only give something other than cash if you are confident you know the recipients' needs better than they do. With the exception of bednets — which really do seem underprovided when they're just put up for sale rather than given away for free — I'm not confident of that. So I gave cash.\n\nAs the World Bank's Jishnu Das once put it, \"'Does giving cash work well' is a well-defined question only if you are willing to say that 'well' is something that WE, the donors, want to define for families whom we have never met and whose living circumstances we have probably never spent a day, let alone a lifetime, in.\" If you're not willing to say that, then you should strongly consider giving cash.\n\n9) Give what you can (though if you can spare it, pledging to give 10 percent of your income would be fantastic)\n\nOne of the hardest problems in philanthropy is deciding how much to donate.\n\nThere are some people who argue the correct answer, unless you’re near the end of your life, is nothing: you should, on this view, not give to charity during your career, and instead save as much of your money as possible and donate it when you die (my colleague Kelsey Piper explains why this is probably not a good approach).\n\nAnother approach is to “earn to give”: take a high-paying job, typically in finance or tech, and give away a huge share of your earnings, like 40 to 50 percent.\n\nI wrote about people who do this back in 2013, and I know that many of the people I profiled still earn-to-give; for them, at least, this is a sustainable option. It’s a really good career option if you like working in finance and tech, but frankly it’s not the best option for most people, and there are a lot of amazing jobs — in scientific research, in the private sector, in direct charity or nonprofit or government work — where the typical person can do more good than they could by using their career as a mechanism through which to generate donation money.\n\nSo I suggest a more moderate course. I’ve signed the Giving What We Can pledge, which commits members to donating 10 percent of their annual income to highly effective charities. That is a totally reasonable number, comparable to alms in many religions, that requires relatively minimal sacrifice relative to what earn-to-give people do. (Here’s an interview I did with Toby Ord, who started the pledge.)\n\nEven if 10 percent is too much for you, though, don’t despair. Giving $1 is better than giving $0. Perhaps the most important thing is to just get into the groove of donating, to make it a habit. I use direct deposit on my paychecks to make most of my charitable contributions, just so it’s extremely automatic and hard for me to avoid doing. Going from not giving to giving a little, regularly, is a huge positive step.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter. Twice a week, you’ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and — to put it simply — getting better at doing good.\n",

          "description": "Luca Romeo\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of Mr. West’s magnum opus, we’re headed back to Obama’s first term to figure out what was the best of Ye’s best\n\nJustin Sayles: Charles, we have a big album anniversary that we have to face today. It’s for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye West’s magnum opus/mea culpa that came out on November 22, 2010. (Do not ask me how old I was on that date, or I will forward this Google doc straight to HR.) This anniversary is difficult to deal with—at the time of its release, so many people declared it a nearly perfect album. (In fact, Pitchfork stamped it as fully perfect, awarding it a 10.0, something it wouldn’t do for another album for a decade.) The hyperbole made sense back in those heady days of the first Obama administration. Kanye was at the peak of his craft and returning from a yearlong shame walk following his infamous 2009 VMAs incident. The music was ambitious, the Hawaiian recording sessions took on mythic status, and the features were pure critic bait (he introduced Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon to a hip-hop audience, even if their definitive collaboration wouldn’t come until “Hold My Liquor” three years later).\n\nBut all of these ideas seem quaint now, with a dramatically changed hip-hop landscape, a Kanye-Trump friendship and comical presidential bid, a borderline disastrous Wyoming detour and gospel album, and “Poopy-di scoop” all sitting between MBDTF and the present. But they’re still worth exploring. In fact, you’ve done so: In the first episode of your new podcast, The Ringer Music Show, you spoke to Kanye collaborators about the who, what, where, and why of that album. And let me say, I learned a lot, and I think even the biggest Kanye stans will.\n\nSo let’s not rehash that all here. Instead, I want to do something you suggested we do for this anniversary. I want to rank every Kanye song and feature from the MBDTF era, or as it’s known to diehards, the Rosewood era. Charles, do you want to begin by explaining what Rosewood is and why this matters in the Kanye story?\n\nCharles Holmes: The Rosewood Movement was part fashion movement, part respectability politics masked as rehabilitation. In short, Kanye forced all of his G.O.O.D. Music artists, entourage, and weed carriers to wear Dior Homme’s Black Classic Skinny Suit that retailed for $2,200 in 2010 at all times. “That’s the Rosewood mentality, like affluence, like not cursing loud in public, pulling out chairs for your lady, opening up doors,” West explained to DJ Clue. On a macro level, it’s also a nice distinction for this time period for MBDTF, G.O.O.D. Fridays, and the features he dropped before and after.\n\nJS: OK, so taking the songs from the album, the G.O.O.D. Friday free releases (which sadly aren’t available outside of shitty YouTube uploads and illegal Soundcloud links), and guest spots, we’ve got 30 or so tracks to work with. That means we’ve got a lot of words to write. So let’s begin, starting with the absolute worst Kanye-related track of that era …\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nKanye West performs at the 2010 BET Awards\n\nLevel 6: O.K. Music\n\n30. “Deuces (Remix)” (Chris Brown single)\n\nCH: In retrospect, it’s wild that “Deuces” was such a hit a decade ago that Chris Brown could unite Rick Ross, Drake, T.I., Kanye West, Fabolous, and André 3000 for a remix. The song has aged about as well as any 2010s song that was in heavy rotation on Hot 97 can, meaning it’s quite honestly terrible. Kanye’s verse is especially egregious, considering lines like “You should have a travel agent, ’cause you a trip / You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit,” weren’t left on the cutting room floor.\n\nJS: It’s a little sad listening to André, who was in the middle of an iconic five-year run of features, relegated to mop-up duties, which he sleepwalks through here. His verse is also a tough listen after sitting through Ye, Fabolous, and Ross, in particular; when Dre says, “Get your minds out the gutter,” he may as well have been talking to them. This song proves only that Chris Brown brings the worst out of everyone around him.\n\n29. “The Joy” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: Charles, I suspect ranking this song so low will get us yelled at on Twitter, but I’m not a huge fan of “The Joy,” and I’ve never been as proud to work with you as when I discovered you felt similarly. It’s somewhat of a waste of Curtis Mayfield and Pete Rock, my all-time favorite producer and one of the key people in elevating sampling into high art. But high art is not what happens here. The beat is fine—a relaxed, minimalist excursion that would’ve likely been an interlude on any of Pete’s LPs. But to me, the song is destroyed by some of the cringiest Kanye lyrics of the era. Like, look at this shit:\n\nShe in her birthday suit ‘cause of the damn cake\nNow there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)\nAnd she want me to cum all over her damn face\n\nAnd:\n\nSo next time you see me on your fallopian\nThough the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian\n\nMaybe I’m a prude, but I never want to hear Ye say cum or fallopian. People love this song, though—so much so that it was tacked onto 2011’s Watch the Throne. What’s up, Charles? Are we right, or is it the kids who are wrong?\n\nCH: This is the perfect example of a song where everyone involved is so enamored of the sample that they collectively decide not to show up in any other regard. If someone had a gun to my head and told me to recite one lyric from this song, I’d just have to tell someone to feed my cat, Sushi, ’cause I’m not making it.\n\n28. “Chain Heavy” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: I’m almost positive Kanye premiered this song standing on a table and rapping it a cappella to the Facebook office. Also, totally forgot this was the same year David Fincher’s The Social Network was released, which might explain our relationship to Mark Zuckerberg at the time of MBDTF. Zuck had yet to upend all of American democracy in 2010, so he was still in the midst of his myth-making years, which is similar to Rosewood-era Kanye. Nevertheless, “Chain Heavy” always sounded better as a snippet.\n\nJS: I have this song slightly higher in my personal rankings, mainly because I’m a sucker for Q-Tip production and Consequence features. But I think “Chain Heavy” got buried a little by virtue of being the last song in the G.O.O.D. Friday series before the release of MBDTF. By that point, Ye had to know he was dropping outtakes.\n\n27. “Runaway Love (Remix)” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: Back in 2010, Kanye placing Raekwon on a baby-faced Justin Bieber single was an expert troll job disguised as some genius idea. Besides the novelty of putting Raekwon’s razor-like voice over the bubblegum hit, this G.O.O.D. Friday track was seen as filler even back then.\n\nJS: Charles, does the “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit” sample mean anything to you?\n\nCH: I have a long and complicated relationship with the Wu-Tang Clan. It mostly stems from the fact that I come from a small town in New Jersey where my seventh grade teacher was white, in his mid-20s, and didn’t see a problem with gloating to one of his only Black students that he didn’t know as much Shaolin as he did. White bros love them some Wu-Tang, but after some soul searching I realized I wouldn’t allow the Wu to be gentrified in my life. So that’s a long way of saying “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit” means a lot to me and Kanye should’ve just stayed away from it.\n\nJS: I wonder what other rappers “cool teachers” have ruined for kids. Like, there’s definitely some English teacher in Missouri that never misses the opportunity to talk to his students about MF Doom.\n\nMy next question: This is one of Bieber’s first “hip-hop” tracks. That means it may be indirectly responsible for “Maria I’m Drunk,” on which he arguably outrapped Travis Scott and Young Thug. (The latter sounds borderline blasphemous, but it’s true.) Does that make this remix a net positive?\n\nCH: Kanye put the battery in Biebervelli’s back, so yes. Honestly, I’d like to see the Chef and JB on a track together in 2020. I’m positive my Canadian brother would lyrically hold his own.\n\n26. “Don’t Look Down” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: This is an honest question—why does Kanye let Mos Def sing badly on so many of his songs? I’m probably in the minority of people who think the only salvageable part of 2007’s “Drunk and Hot Girls” is the Mos Def part, but that’s not exactly some high compliment. “Don’t Look Down” aspires to be more than it is. Lupe Fiasco has an esoteric verse about a phoenix. Kanye bathes his voice in some distortion that sounds like a cheap imitation of what he’d use on “Runaway.” Surprisingly, Big Sean has the best verse by miles, which is a theme throughout most of these G.O.O.D. Friday tracks. At a time when Sean was relegated to the periphery of G.O.O.D. Music, he generally proved his worth by putting in more effort than the bulk of his compatriots.\n\nJS: I mean, Mos isn’t a technically great singer, but “Umi Says” is a classic, to say nothing of “Definition.” (I suspect you feel differently, Charles.) There are far greater problems with the song, including the overwrought production, which drags for nearly six minutes. But mostly, I’m confused about why you’re highlighting a verse that includes the lines “Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds / Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out / I mean ash it out so I could see you smile.” That’s a tough sell, even by the standards of Big Sean’s wordplay.\n\n25. “Take One for the Team” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: An utterly forgettable song with a Kanye verse that is way too aggro, but I’d like to point out one thing. Toward the middle of Kanye’s verse, he raps, “Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell / Or that Goddamn cucumber Bath and Body Works?” First of all, my question to you, Justin, is simple. Do you like cucumber scents and/or Bath and Body Works?\n\nJS: I have to confess, Charles. I’m one of those guys who uses two-in-one shampoo/conditioners and buys whatever body wash is closest to me in the store when I remember I need it. If one of those things happens to be cucumber-scented, cool. But I don’t have strong opinions.\n\nCH: We need to boss your life up, JS. I’m talking about strolling over to the local mall and getting some Lush bath bombs. In this Ringer household, we only bathing in the finest scents. In 2021, we’re leaving cucumber- and sweet-pea-based soaps behind. It’s all about them subtle citrus and wood smells.\n\nJS: Subtle citrus and wood smells, the new Rosewood Movement. Got it.\n\n24. “Devil in a New Dress” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: I once heard you declare this one of Kanye’s worst songs. This is not a widely held position, to put it mildly. Would you care to explain why you feel that way?\n\nCH: The flip of Smokey Robinson’s “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” always bugged me. Every human operates on a certain frequency and that high-pitched, recurring sample grates on my very existence. Kanye is the pied piper of nostalgia. People continuously rate his first three albums as unimpeachable projects he can never surmount, and a lot of that has to do with the soul samples mixed with the faux-conscious raps. Kanye’s two verses on this song are merely fine. Like, y’all are going to sit on Jeff Bezos’s internet and tell me that Kanye rapping, “The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme? / That’s ‘Dior Homme,’ not ‘Dior, homie,’” really belongs on the Mount Olympus of hip-hop?\n\nThe only saving grace of this song is Rick Ross’s verse, which is immaculate, and even I’m not enough of an asshole to say otherwise.\n\nJS: It’s a good song, Charles. But not sure I’d feel so strongly if it existed only in its G.O.O.D. Friday version, which didn’t include Rozay—or more importantly, that breakdown. For all of the bloated track lengths and proggy ambitions on MBDTF, the middle third of “Devil in a New Dress” remains one of its highlights. The sample and drums drop out, and we’re left with piano, bass, strings, and a heavily-vocoded Kanye. It’s a stunning moment, and I get lost in it every time.\n\n23. “Blame Game” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: I occasionally visit the r/BrandNewSentence subreddit, where people post “sentences never before written, found in the wild.” Recent examples include “Man accused of Ponzi scheme attempts to escape FBI with underwater scooter” and “Victorian baby yeet machine.” I submit that, had this subreddit existed back in 2010, “You call me motherfucker for long” would’ve been a worthy post because nobody before or since then has ever uttered those words in that order.\n\nBut to the track: Which song off MBDTF has aged the worst, and why is it “Blame Game?”\n\nCH: It’s the misogyny. On a technical level, I don’t mind the John Legend chorus, the somber production, or how it narratively closes out MBDTF, but Kanye’s lyrics and the Chris Rock coda are truly a misstep on an otherwise exceptional album. Kanye often dips into extreme incel territory, and it’s only gotten worse with age. “Blame Game” was a harbinger of what was to come years later on songs like “I Thought About Killing You” or the unreleased “New Body.” Is there any line that sums up late-stage Kanye and his terrible politics as well as, “You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you?”\n\nThe saving grace of “Blame Game” arrives when Kanye finally sheds the toxicity. His voice launches into a falsetto and sounds amateurish next to Legend, but it’s the raw quality that sells the heartbreak at the center of MBDTF. As Kanye repeats the refrain “I can’t love you this much,” it feels like a rare moment when a megastar realizes how brutally celebrity has warped their perception of reality.\n\nJS: I loved this song at the time, and I still love the Aphex Twin sample, but I don’t need this song in my life anymore. Plus, as toxic Kanye breakup songs go, this is no “30 Hours.” “The only thing open is Waffle House / Girl, don’t start with me” >>>> “Now you noticeable and can’t nobody get control of you.”\n\n Andy Kropa/Getty Images\n\nKanye West and Gwen Stefani at a September 2010 fashion show in New York City\n\nLevel 5: F.I.N.E. Music\n\n22. “Don’t Stop” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: I was never enamored of Child Rebel Soldier—the kind-of supergroup of Kanye, Pharrell, and Lupe Fiasco. Relistening to “Don’t Stop” 10 years later makes me realize that my teenage taste wasn’t that far off the mark. There was a moment in the 2000s when you could tell Pusha T was penning all of Pharrell’s raps, because out of nowhere the legendary producer would talk about his prowess at cooking and selling drugs. “Don’t Stop” is no different, especially considering it also includes the type of homophobic bars that were all too common in 2010.\n\nJS: Do you think Push wrote Pharrell’s “Move That Dope” verse? And if so, how long do you think it took to convince Skateboard P that “the Gandalf hat and the weird-ass clothes” was a fire bar?\n\nCH: Push most definitely wrote that verse. There’s no way Pharrell is waking up one day and thinking he should rap, “I know guerrillas with the triggers that’s on a banana clip / And packin’ with the biggest missiles.”\n\nJS: Just another reason Pusha T is one of our finest Americans. If Hillary had picked him over Tim Kaine, we wouldn’t be in this mess.\n\n21. “In for the Kill (Remix)” (La Roux [Gold Edition])\n\nCH: La Roux really needs her flowers. The run she went on in 2009 and 2010 was unmatched. “In for the Kill’ is the type of rarified pop excellence you just don’t see anymore. Kanye is way too horny for his own good on the remix, which makes sense considering this was during a time when he’d subject everyone to his porn-watching habits in the studio. But the fact that even a horny Kanye couldn’t ruin “In for the Kill” speaks to its excellence so many years later.\n\nJS: I’m a fan of Kanye’s random appearances on dance songs during this era. (See also: “American Boy”; Stromae’s “Alors on Danse.”) He doesn’t add a ton to these tracks, but it’s a nice time capsule—of where he was in his career and what popular music sounded like before the trap explosion. Sad we never got him on “Danza Kuduro.”\n\n20. “Looking for Trouble” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: J. Cole and I have a contentious relationship, meaning I tend to dismiss most of his music, and he has no idea I exist. But this is the rare time when I give J. Cole his respect. There’s an old quote washed-up basketball players tell their delusional charges, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity,” but damn if Cole didn’t take full advantage of this star-making turn on “Looking for Trouble.” As the story goes, J. Cole received the beat for the song the night before Kanye was due to release it, while he was in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n“I got a call from Kanye and he was like, ‘What’s up? It’s Kanye. Can you get that verse today? I’m tryna put the song out tonight.’ I honestly didn’t think I could do it in time so I told him that,” Cole told Complex in 2010. “He said, ‘I’ll wait. We got engineers up all night so you got a while to do it. But if you can, have it done by today.’ I said, ‘I’ll make it happen somehow.’ I wrote my verse on the hour-and-a-half ride to Detroit, did the radio promos, left that, went directly to the studio, laid the verse, and sent it to him by 5 o’clock.”\n\nUp to this point, Cole had spent the majority of his career modeling himself after West and you can hear that extreme competitive urge to impress on his closing verse. Cole has always been at his best when he has a clearly defined antagonist and his verse sounds as if he’s asking Ye, “Why in the hell did you sign Big Sean and Cudi over me?” Throughout his verse, Cole compares himself to Biblical figures and Hov, but it’s when the beat cuts out that he underlines how long he’s waited for this moment. “Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming ‘bout,” he brazenly says to the world. Cole had finally arrived.\n\nJS: My only problem with this: The sample flip immediately reminds me of Cam’ron’s “Bubble Music,” even if the production on “Looking for Trouble” is superior. (Equally distracting: CyHi’s verse, which includes the line “I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble.”) But J. Cole is phenomenal here, delivering bars so powerful that Kanye cleared out the beat for him. It can be easy to write Cole off—he can be tedious and condescending, and I will never forgive him for what he did to Jeremih’s “Planez”—but when he raps like this, it makes you wonder why he’s never been able to cement himself as an all-time great.\n\n19. “Erase Me” (Man on the Moon II)\n\nCH: The heathens really wasn’t rocking with “Erase Me” back in the day. In fairness, this was the era of the Knux and Chiddy Bang, meaning a bunch of kids reared on Pitchfork’s indie snobbery were making rock-inspired rap groups. Sonically, “Erase Me,” fit squarely into this era while aging better than any of its contemporaries. Kid Cudi’s singing is far more vibrant and lively than anything else on the dour Man on the Moon II. The main guitar melody and the explosive drums on the chorus never do too much. Even Kanye tries his best to deliver a rare charming verse about a potential lover before he ruins it with that sweet, sweet Rosewood-era misogyny.\n\nJS: I never fully got the Kid Cudi thing—being born in the early ’80s will do that to you—but I respect that kids from your generation ride so hard for him. Also, the first Man on the Moon basically plays like a circa-2008 Hype Machine chart, what with the MGMT and Ratatat features and Menahan Street Band samples and Crookers remix. That’s a lot of fun for me, a certified Old. (Though if you want to talk Rosewood-era misogyny, let’s not forget about “Make Her Say.”)\n\n18. “Lord Lord Lord” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: A perfect freebie track. It’s a solid, low-stakes affair with good-not-great verses from Mos Def and Raekwon, and every Charlie Wilson hook should be treasured. (I’m confused about why we had to stretch this out to seven minutes to fit that Swizz verse, though that’s another discussion.) But what I’m most interested in here is the sample: It’s a straight loop of “Solstice,” an obscure 1978 jazz-funk song from Brian Bennett, a British composer best known for his work as a library musician. (That’s a big deal to record-collector nerds.) “Solstice” has improbably become something of a hip-hop staple. It’s been sampled hundreds of times—most notably by Nas, Rick Ross, and the High & the Mighty—and even made its way into songs from Kaytranada and the Mike Patton–Dan the Automator team-up, Lovage. “Lord Lord Lord” is one of the better songs to use it. Kanye let “Solstice” breathe, not adding any drums or altering the pitch. Somewhat paradoxically, by doing the least with the sample, “Lord Lord Lord” gets the most out of “Solstice.”\n\nCH: You just spilled a lot of ink on an extremely mid G.O.O.D. Friday song. All of the elements of “Lord Lord Lord” are fine. Charlie Wilson needs a field’s worth of flowers, so he’ll forever be safe from my ire. The beat isn’t offensive. The various artists arrive with a pulse, but between Kanye saying “I only hang with white boys that like black sluts” and Swizz Beatz dissing bloggers I’m good on this one.\n\n17. “Power (Remix)” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: When I was a child, one of my favorite songs was Snap’s “The Power” (which, if you’re unfamiliar, has its own complicated backstory). So when I heard that Kanye was flipping a sample of it into a remix of his “Power” with the help of Swizz Beatz—who was on a streak of turning dance songs into club anthems—I was pretty amped. But the end result is a mixed bag. The Jay-Z verse is fine, as is the opening Kanye verse. (Ye got an assist from Kobe? OK, sure.) Musically, however, there’s a lot going on here. (It’s gettin’ kinda hectic, if you will.) The added synths are another distraction in an already busy beat. And eliminating the King Crimson sample in favor of some 30 Seconds to Mars–core singing isn’t doing it for me. The song comes alive in the second half when the Snap beat drops and Kanye lets loose, but I can’t see anyone picking this over the original.\n\nCH: I have a soft spot in my heart for “Power (Remix).” The song is fine, but I distinctly remember Funk Flex premiering the record on Hot 97 back in the waning years of rappers still bringing their records to the DJ. So for a solid day, I only heard “Power (Remix)” with a bunch of Flex bombs as he marketed the record like it was the most important thing in the world. It was not, young readers, but Flex truly did have that *cough cough* power back in the day. If you don’t believe me go listen to his premiere of “Otis.”\n\n16. “Hell of a Life” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Dirtbag Kanye has always been one of my favorite Kanyes. The song is a little icky given the Jesus Is King rapper’s admitted porn addiction and his love for his future wife’s, um, filmography, but I’ll take Ye rapping about drugs and weirdo sex over whatever is happening on his past few albums. It’s also a spiritual predecessor to “No Church in the Wild” or the more interesting parts of Yeezus, like “I Am a God” or “Hold My Liquor.” “Hell of a Life” sounds a little dated in 2020, but I still mess with it.\n\nCH: This song sounds like a sentient XVideos search bar. The propulsive crunch and dark chaos of “Hell of a Life” is so immaculately produced that even horny Kanye can’t ruin this track. In 2016, famous adult actress Lisa Ann claimed that Kanye sent her unsolicited photos of the explicit variety. Combined with the aforementioned porn addiction, “Hell of a Life” is a bizarre time capsule. So much of Kanye’s Rosewood era is about an excess of ego, celebrity, and sex that in the following years seemed to spin wildly out of control.\n\n Peter Kramer/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal\n\nKanye West appears on NBC’s Today show in November 2010\n\nLevel 4: G.O.O.D. Music\n\n15. “Start It Up” (The Hunger for More 2)\n\nCH: For a brief but blindingly transcendent moment in 2010, Lloyd Banks was the best rapper alive. It was as if the entire music industry descended upon G-Unit’s second-in-command, determined to turn him into a household name. The DJs at Hot 97 and Power 105 should be arrested for how much they played “Beamer, Benz, or Bentley.” At the dawn of a new decade, every rapper either wanted to be on a song with Lloyd Banks or remix one of his hits. “Start It Up” alone had Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie, and Fabolous on it.\n\nThe beautiful thing about “Start It Up” is how obvious it is that Kanye didn’t want to get outrapped by Banks. It’s as if Kanye told all of his ghostwriters to form like Voltron in pursuit of delivering a decent verse. To this day, the line, “The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it / Ain’t nobody fucking with me, I platonic’d it” is as dumb as it is great. JS, how do you feel about Lloyd Banks?\n\nJS: As someone who came of age during the G-Unit mixtape era, I’ve always loved him. He obviously wasn’t a star on the level of 50 Cent, but as rap henchmen go, there have been few better than Banks. (I’m shocked this line didn’t cause Fat Joe to drop dead right on the spot, because it nearly killed me when I heard it.) Also, don’t tell anyone, but I prefer his version of “Victory” to the original.\n\nBanks is one of the best punch-line rappers of his generation, whereas Kanye is just one of the punch-line-iest. Charles, do you have a least favorite Kanye punch line? I have a tough time deciding between “They be ballin’ in the D-League / I be speakin’ Swaghili” and “I’m a rap-lic priest / Gettin’ head by the nuns.”\n\nCH: 2013’s “I’m In It” is one of my favorite Kanye West songs of all time, but paradoxically contains the two worst Kanye lyrics of all time:\n\nChasin’ love, lots of bittersweet hours lost / Eatin’ Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce\n\nUh, Black girl sippin’ white wine / Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign\n\nKanye rapping about race is bad. Kanye rapping about sex is worse. When you put those two together, you get the above.\n\nJS: We just cited four terrible lines from “I’m in It,” yet we both love the song. Fucking Kanye.\n\n14. “Christmas in Harlem” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: I thought the perfect Harlem Holiday song already existed before this in “Ballin’ on Xmas,” which appeared on Jim Jones’s Dipset Christmas album. But the final version of this song—on which Pusha T turns Santa’s weight into a coke punch line—beats it by a mile. (Predictably, it also features Jim Jones.)\n\nCH: We absolutely needed “Christmas In Harlem” for Cam’ron’s verse alone. There will never be a funnier moment in a Christmas song than Cam closing his verse out with “shouts to the coldest on my barometer / Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah,” and then ad-libbing “my lawyers” immediately after. You can’t buy that type of publicity.\n\n13. “See Me Now” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: The people don’t deserve “See Me Now.” When Angie Martinez premiered the record on Hot 97 it was supposed to be such a moment. Kanye assembled Beyoncé and Charlie Wilson to collaborate over a cheery Lex Luger and No I.D. beat. Was it obvious that “See Me Now” was an easy, feel-good track meant to get him back in the peoples’ good graces? Yes. Does that mean it deserved to be yawned at? Hell no. The Charlie hook alone should’ve at least given this song a week at no. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nJS: You ever think about how Lex Luger defined the sound of rap for two years at the beginning of the last decade and then basically disappeared? Yeah, there was “B.M.F.” and “MC Hammer,” but also “Who Da Neighbors” and all the Waka Flocka table-flippers. Starting around 2013—probably thanks largely to Drake and 40—rap got a little moodier, chillier, and less fantastical. “See Me Now” isn’t one of those ultra-maximal Lex Luger productions (sounds like No I.D. was in the driver’s seat here), but I wanted to give credit to the man who made “9000 Watts” possible.\n\n12. “So Appalled” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: Why the fuck is “So Appalled” even this high? Get this shit out of here, JS.\n\nJS: I’m legit wondering whether you like this album, or Kanye, or music in general. “So Appalled” is great for so many reasons: the beat, the Pusha verse, CyHi’s “Trojan in the pocket / Matt Leinart” double entendre, the Swizz chorus, RZA’s pronunciation of “fuckin’ ridiculous.” What’s the matter, Otter? You got Bobby Brown jaw?\n\nCH: I don’t hate “So Appalled,” but it always felt like it should have stayed a G.O.O.D. Friday loosie. It’s not a terrible song, but it’s also a song that’s extremely fat around the edges. For those who have forgotten, “So Appalled” clocks in at almost seven minutes. It’s not even the best posse cut on the album, despite being longer than “All of the Lights,” “Monster,” and “Gorgeous.”\n\n11. Monster (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Charles, I want to discuss something you broke down on The Ringer Music Show: the fact that Kanye almost left “Monster” off My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy because Nicki outshined him. First, how incredibly on-brand. Second, do you think that decision was a Sliding Doors moment? What would we have missed out on had “Monster” been trapped in YouTube videos and MediaFire links?\n\nCH: For Nicki Minaj, “Monster” always felt like a Kobayashi Maru. The once-in-a-generation verse was the final spark that Minaj needed to go from a talented member of Lil Wayne’s nascent Young Money crew to the subject of full-fledged debates about whether she was a top-five rapper in the world (spoiler alert: she was). Unfortunately, “Monster” was an artistic peak for Nicki, one that she’s still chasing. She became a better lyricist and artist in later years, but “Monster” was the last time it felt like Minaj had to serve only one genre. When “Super Bass” hit, the trajectory of her career changed. Being a household name that appears on Ellen is wildly different from being the subject of debates raging in the 2Dopeboyz comment section. If “Monster” hadn’t made My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, it’d still be worshipped, but it also might have ensured Minaj’s career trajectory was a tad more gradual.\n\nJS: I think she reached her full potential in 2014, around the time of Pinkprint, when she was at her pop apex all while dropping truly great verses on “No Flex Zone,” “Lookin’ Ass,” and her version of “Danny Glover.” It’s been a steady decline for her since, partly because of self-sabotage and partly because rap treats its female stars like garbage once it finds someone to replace them.\n\nMy next question: Jay-Z’s overall résumé is unimpeachable, but he’s certainly lost some luster in the past 15 years. His verse on this song in particular gets clowned frequently. Charles, do you think his eh turn on “Monster” changed how we think about Hov? In other words: Love—does late-period Jay get enough of it, too much of it, or just the right amount of it?\n\nCH: It’s critical reevaluation time. Jay-Z’s “Monster” verse is comically bad, but also it’s charming that the Marcy rapper who bragged about losing 92 bricks would spend the beginning of the 2010s rapping about Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness, Goblin, ghouls, and zombies who are devoid of a conscience. Later-stage Jay-Z albums (e.g., Magna Carta Holy Grail, 4:44) could have used more spooky bars.\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAl Jardine Kanye West at the “We Are the World 25 Years for Haiti” recording session held on February 1, 2010, in Hollywood\n\nLevel 3: G.R.E.A.T. Music\n\n10. “Live Fast, Die Young” (Teflon Don)\n\nCH: This song wasn’t originally intended for Rick Ross’s 2010 classic, Teflon Don, but was made during the MBDTF sessions. The James Brown “Funky President” and Rick James “Mary Jane (Live)” samples that punctuate the beat are the same one’s Kanye would play with across his fifth studio album. The horns lifted from the Bar-Kay’s “If This World Were Mine” sound so grandiose you can tell Island Def Jam paid a hefty check to get everything cleared.\n\nBut “Live Fast, Die Young” always felt like it was of the Rosewood era without neatly fitting into the MBDTF narrative. Ross’s verses are too celebratory. Kanye is having the time of his life, despite trying to put on a repentant facade. Even the Chicago rapper’s verse spit directly in the face of his detractors. When Kanye raps, “I’m back by unpopular demand / Least he still poppin’ in Japan, shoppin’ in Milan / Hoppin’ out the van, screams from the fans / ‘Yeezy, always knew you’d be on top again,’” it’s not only hilarious, but a rare moment that reaffirmed Kanye’s one-of-a-kind ego was healing nicely.\n\nJS: There’s allegedly an unreleased Hype Williams–directed video for this song. It’s a damn-near crime that we never got Hype to shoot a video for Rozay while the big man was at the peak of his powers. If I ever get my hands on a time machine, I’m dropping 2010 Rick Ross in 1998 and telling Hype to turn on the fish-eyed lens and give us the $10 million video the Teflon Don deserved.\n\n9. “Power” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: On The Ringer Music Show, you spoke to S1, a then-unknown producer who had given a beat CD to longtime Kanye confidant Rhymefest. On it was the skeleton for “Power”—it had the chanted sample and the Cold Grits drums, but not much else, right? Kanye hears it, gets S1 on the first plane to Hawaii, and they begin to figure out how to make this beat worthy of Ye’s comeback album. First comes the King Crimson sample, next comes the bass and guitars courtesy of Mike Dean, then the keyboards by Dean and Jeff Bhasker. Eventually, they’d add a goddamn cello. The end result is so full, so booming, and so triumphant that it lives on as an arena anthem and soundtrack to terrible movie trailers a decade later.\n\nThat is the genius of Kanye beginning with this era: In the early Roc-a-Fella and College Dropout days, he mainly crafted beats in isolation. During the Late Registration and Graduation days, he began adding orchestral flourishes and collaborating with outside producers, but it was still mostly whatever came out of his MPC. But by My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he had an army of producers and musicians at his disposal. The individual pieces were great on their own—I’m sure I would’ve enjoyed the original S1 beat had it ended up on a Rhymefest album—but under Kanye’s direction, all the parts came together into something indelible. And that’s power.\n\nCH: “Power” is such an awkward song. There’s so much going on, from the chants to the King Crimson sample. The beat is so staccato at times that Kanye clearly struggles to fit all of his thoughts within its parameter. For a clear example, look no further than the couplet, “You short-minded niggas’ thoughts is Napoleon / My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in.” But none of that ends up mattering. “Power” is more about setting a tone for an era than the pursuit of perfection. There’s a reason the song became movie trailer fodder over the next decade—2010’s The Social Network, 2011’s Limitless, 2017’s Power Rangers, 2017’s All the Money in the World. The power of “Power” is how well it denotes a sense of triumph before Kanye ever utters a word. It’s a feat of Kanye West as a producer more than a showcase for his talents as a rapper. Anyone can tell you they’re powerful. It’s another thing to make you feel it.\n\n8. “G.O.O.D. Friday” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: This song, more than any other, makes me sad that we never got a G.O.O.D. Music compilation aside from Cruel Summer, which I remember now only for “New God Flow” and stray shots fired at Kris Humphries and George Tenet. (2012, baby!) But “G.O.O.D. Friday,” the eponymous track from the legendary free-release series that dominated the second half of 2010, is a perfect showcase for what Kanye and his cohorts do best. There’s the beat, with pounding drums and a familiar sample flipped in a way you’d never heard it before. Uncle Charlie breathes life into the hook. Cudi’s crooning is a wonderful accent. Pusha and Big Sean deliver; latter-day Common even acquits himself nicely. A good time all around and, sadly, a track that could never be made today.\n\nCH: So much of the music that was made during the “Rosewood” era seemed engineered as peak critical bait. The samples were either obscure or ridiculously expensive. Every song needed an extended outro. Legendary producers were called in as vibe connoisseurs. It made for a near perfect album, but often that meant there was little room for something that was simply fun. “G.O.O.D. Friday” never seeks to do too much. Kid Cudi is on hook duty and offers a couple well-placed hums. Pusha T raps about his one true love, selling cocaine. Big Sean drops some goofy punch lines. G.O.O.D. Music may not have been the most lucrative rapper imprint of the 2010s (that’s Young Money), but it was easily the most cohesive.\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nJay-Z and Kanye West perform at Yankee Stadium on September 13, 2010 in New York City\n\nLevel 2: C.L.A.S.S.I.C. Music\n\n7. “Run This Town” (Blueprint 3)\n\nJS: Blueprint 3 produced two of Jay-Z’s biggest commercial hits, including “Run This Town,” which is great. (The other, “Empire State of Mind” was his first no. 1 single; it’s terrible.) But by the time BP3 was released in September 2009, it had become clear that Ye, who had just dropped four straight classic albums, had surpassed Big Brother, who was in the middle of an uneven post-“retirement” stretch. The gap between the two only widened over the next few years, as Jay receded while the fire within Kanye grew—we hear it in Jay’s two MBDTF verses, while 2011’s Watch the Throne is mostly a Kanye showcase. “Run This Town” marked the second time Jay had ever put a Kanye verse on one of his albums, following The Blueprint 2’s “The Bounce.” But in 2002, Ye was an upstart still two years away from The College Dropout; he was a young producer trying to rap, not the megawatt multi-hyphenate we’ve come to alternately love and detest. Seven years after “The Bounce,” “Run This Town” presented Jay and Kanye as equals, which makes it something of an unofficial passing of the torch.\n\nKanye has had many understudies. Two have been successful—Cudi, who has a complicated history with his mentor, and Travis Scott, who let Drake threaten to hunt Ye down on “Sicko Mode.” Charles, why do you think Kanye never inspired a true successor like Jay inspired him?\n\nCH: Kanye’s ego has always stopped him from truly minting an heir apparent. There’s a reason Drake’s verse didn’t make “All of the Lights,” J.Cole was relegated to a G.O.O.D. Friday track, and Nicki Minaj’s scene-stealing moment on “Monster” almost caused Ye to take the song off MBDTF. Kanye is a supreme opportunist. He’ll collaborate with anyone that can help him sell more records or gain some type of cultural cachet, but the minute that artist shows a sign of surpassing him, tension arises. We’ve seen that Lil Wayne had no problem with his protégés (Drake, Nicki, and kind of Tyga) becoming more popular than him. In a similar way, Gucci Mane is responsible for putting on rappers like Migos and Young Thug. On the other hand, when Kanye sees rappers like Drake, Cole, Chance the Rapper, and Travis Scott updating his playbook, there’s something within him that won’t let him recede.\n\n6. “All of the Lights” / “All of the Lights (Interlude)”\n\nJS: You spend a lot of time breaking this song down on the podcast. I would recommend people go there to listen to the story of the making of “All of the Lights” and how Ye got the most left-field guest of the entire album and why Drake doesn’t appear on the final version. So instead of rehashing that, I want to ask an important question: Which of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’s five covers was your favorite?\n\nCH: The George Condo painting of Kanye wearing a crown with his head impaled by a sword was a very on-the-nose metaphor, but it always seemed the most apt. There’s a reason it was Kanye’s Twitter avatar for the longest time. Kanye’s identity is molded by this idea of being the one. Over the years, Kanye’s transitioned from rapping about Jesus (2004’s “Jesus Walks”) to proclaiming he’s a God throughout 2013’s Yeezus. Back in 2010, Condo’s illustrated sword seemed like a symbol of public perception killing West. In retrospect, the deadly sword was always wielded by Kanye and he’d forever be doomed to fall upon it.\n\nJS: Ten years ago, I would have also picked that one. (That’s the version of the CD I bought back when we still bought CDs.) Today, however, I’m a fan of the naked sphinx straddling a beer-clutching Kanye. It was banned by Walmart and the iTunes Store at the time. Shockingly, it’s the version Spotify uses, even though it’s pixelated on our parent company’s platform. Condo was disgusted by the censorship: “The superimposition of people’s perceptions on a cartoon is shocking,” he said in 2010. “What’s happening in their minds should be banned. Not the painting.” Amen.\n\n5. “Lost in the World” / “Who Will Survive in America” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Why do you think Kanye brought Justin Vernon into his orbit over the hundred other popular indie musicians circa 2010? Why Bon Iver and not, say, Grizzly Bear?\n\nCH: Because Justin Vernon is interesting and sounds like an angel, while Grizzly Bear is boring outside of that one time Jay-Z and Beyoncé went to go see them live and Pitchfork had a field day blogging about it.\n\nJS: Do you have a favorite Bon Iver song? Personally, I break out “Blood Bank” whenever the weather dips below 40 degrees.\n\nCH: 2016’s “715 - CRΣΣKS,” is the peak of Justin Vernon’s powers. On the surface the 22, A Million song is so ugly. There’s no beat for Vernon to hide behind. All the audience can listen to is this android-like voice that’s so mangled and tortured you can’t help but want to save it.\n\nVernon is a once-in-a-lifetime talent who came of age as the internet and technology was beginning to reshape the way we connected with the sound of the human voice. Vernon, along with T-Pain and Future, was able to summon this paradoxical feeling of technology’s creeping coldness and endless ambition through the way he contorted his voice with Auto-Tune, reverb, and a flurry of other engineering techniques. Kanye was able to introduce Vernon to the wider world on songs like “Lost in the World,” but it was on “715 - CRΣΣKS” that years of experimentation was finally perfected.\n\nJS: Sadly, we’ll probably never get another JV-Kanye collab, because he, like most of us, can no longer kick it with Kanye.\n\n Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nKanye West performs at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards\n\nLevel 1: P.E.R.F.E.C.T. Music\n\n4. “Christian Dior Denim Flow” (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: The greatest tragedy of modern pop music is that “Christian Dior Denim Flow” didn’t make My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Several tracks could have been sacrificed to give it a spot—“So Appalled,” “Devil in a New Dress,” “Blame Game.” Kanye’s hormones get the best of him as he wastes a truly transcendent beat trying to slide into the DMs of every model that was working in 2010. Kid Cudi’s amateurish voice expertly melds with John Legend’s classically trained vocals as they lament being at the peak of their powers and still calling that same ex back. JS, why is “Christian Dior Denim Flow” the greatest song of all time?\n\nJS: It’s the most inspirational song I can think of named after luxury clothing. But it’s the melody, and the drums programming, and that chorus, and that switch-up in the back half. But I go a different direction than you—this song is better than three-fourths of MBDTF, but it just doesn’t fit the album’s vibe to me. It doesn’t fully capture the tortured-genius energy he wanted to project in this era. And it’s clear Kanye was in part trying to make a cohesive statement rather than just a collection of the best songs to come of the sessions. The tragedy here is that we never got to hear a fully mixed and mastered version of “Christian Dior Denim Flow.” (Again, this is why we needed another, better G.O.O.D. Music compilation. Can we at least get these G.O.O.D Friday tracks on streaming in 2021? How is “Lift Yourself” on Spotify but this song isn’t?!?!)\n\nAlso: Predictably, I love the Pusha verse. But there’s someone on the track who clearly outspits him.\n\nCH: “Christian Dior Denim Flow” is home to two of the best verses spit by best-rapper-alive candidates in 2010. When Kanye tweeted, “Yo man Lloyd Banks prolly the most underrated MC in the game...Man he deserve to be top 5 at least,” it wasn’t hyperbole. At the height of the rap-blog boom, Lloyd Banks had returned with a vengeance. G-Unit’s second-in-command was an unstoppable force with the entire music industry seemingly backing his ascent. The Hunger for More 2 would drop the same day as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and provide a gritty foil to Kanye’s baroque sonic banquet. Nevertheless, hearing Banks deliver a truly perfect verse opener like “Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal / Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm” is still jaw dropping a decade later. The little puking ad-lib he delivers after he raps, “Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)” belongs in the MoMA. Throughout Banks’s all-too-short verse, his voice sounds like it was run through that woodchipper in Fargo and that is the ultimate compliment.\n\nJS: I want nothing more than to listen to a Jadakiss–Lloyd Banks podcast. (Spotify, make it happen.) But who was the other best-rapper-alive candidate in 2010? You can make an argument for Kanye, but I suspect you’re thinking someone else …\n\nCH: Scott Mescudi was the only rapper coming close to matching Banks on “Christian Dior Denim Flow.” By late 2010, Cudi was months removed from everyone in hip-hop thinking he was ingesting liquid cocaine (not a real thing). So how does he approach the haters? Well, he summons the spirit of one of the greatest rappers of all time. “Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000,” he raps toward the conclusion of the song. “I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling.” Kid Cudi would eventually need counseling, but for a fleeting moment he made us all believe one could be healed through the power of immaculate rapping on Kanye West loosies.\n\n3. “Dark Fantasy” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: The best Kanye albums generally begin with a thesis statement.\n\n“We weren’t supposed to make it past 25 / Joke’s on you we still alive” —The College Dropout\n\n“Oh, he’ll give us what we need / It may not be what we want” —Yeezus\n\n“Can we get much higher?” —My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n\nAfter Nicki Minaj’s cute but unnecessary nursery rhyme, Teyana Taylor and Justin Vernon arrive like oracles to set the stage. It’s a rhetorical question, but it’s also a sign of West picking his shot. One could argue from a craft standpoint that Kanye never reached the heights of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy again, and it all begins with “Dark Fantasy.”\n\nJS: Back when I used to DJ (I’ve lived many lives, Charles), I’d often break this song out about 10 minutes before close, when everyone was good and drunk and ready to fuck, fight, or cry. I’d loop the instrumental break that comes between the intro and the verse and immediately start blending in one of my true closing songs (the “Killing Me Softly” drums sound pretty good under it). For a beautiful 20 seconds before I’d kick to the next track, the entire club would scream along to “Can we get much higher?” For a fleeting moment, the answer, for me, just like Kanye, was a resounding no.\n\n2. “Gorgeous” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: In 2010, only Kid Cudi could make singing about celebrity anxiety sound like a Greek tragedy. Over an epic guitar riff, Cudi’s slightly distorted voice wails:\n\nNot for nothing, I’ve foreseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\nIn those four bars, Kanye and his G.O.O.D. Music associates sum up My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’s entire reason for being. Not only was Kanye’s fame slipping away in 2010, but there was an acute sense that perfecting his next album was the only way he could surmount the very people who would “never ever” let him live his interruption of Swift down. So when Kanye launches into the first verse it’s a clear sink-or-swim moment.\n\nJS: There’s so much to love about “Gorgeous,” from the hook to the beat to Raekwon. But what stands out 10 years later is the elegance of Kanye’s verses, which says a lot considering he fires a bar at Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It’s some of the best pure rapping he’s ever committed to wax, with intricate rhyme patterns and thought-provoking couplets masking his seething fury. Topically, it’s high-minded stuff. We make a lot of how My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an attempt to get himself back in the public’s good graces following the Taylor Swift incident. But when you consider the racial component of the backlash he faced, using the second track on the album to explore race, class, and policing is fairly brave. A lot of credit is likely owed to Malik Yusef, Rhymefest, and the other writers that helped him through “Gorgeous,” but the verses are ultimately unmistakably Kanye. And they’re among the best of his career.\n\n1. “Runaway” (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: Without “Runaway,” there’s no My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song exists on multiple poles of existence—sparse and maximalist, tortured and pompous, noxious and rehabilitative. “Runaway” begins with now-iconic piano stabs that echo hauntingly in the ether before they’re confronted by the shamanic voices of Rick James and James Brown. The genesis of “Runaway” was a seemingly thrown-away idea by Emile Haynie. “I had a beat, and I played it, and it was the foundation of ‘Runaway,’” Haynie told Complex in 2011. “It was pretty different from the production now, but something about it, the chord progression or the way I put together the chords must’ve rung out to him.” Kanye was likely drawn to the chance to have an emotional canvas to purge himself of the VMA and Taylor Swift incident that had utterly destroyed his pop career.\n\nJS: Kanye was the asshole, the douchebag, the scumbag. But I remember watching the VMA performance live and rooting for him. It was so pretentious—with the ballerinas, a salmon-suited Pusha T, and Ye’s MPC at the center of it, like a pulpit—but you had to admire the ambition. Watching it today, I still get chills when the beat drops and the Rick James sample echoes. It’s also important that the lyrics—the chorus, in particular—acknowledged his standing at the time. Here he was, one year after the Taylor Swift incident, on the same stage, essentially saying, “Yeah, I know you hate me, but what I’m offering you is so great, I’m going to make you love me again.” You could feel public sentiment bending back toward him in real time.\n\nWe are, of course, at a similar place with Kanye as we were heading into those VMAs. The past four years have been fraught. The quality of his music has declined. He’s palled around with Trump. He publicly wrestled with his mental health. He’s made bone-headed comments about race. He launched a failed presidential bid. These days, the Kanye experience is exhausting. I don’t think there’s a “Runaway” moment that could change that, though I don’t think he’d be capable of providing one even if one could. Still, it’s hard not to put on this song today and recall the time when we were cheering for him to change how we felt about him. That he pulled it off may have been his most impressive feat in a career littered with many.\n\nCH: I totally agree. It’s something Kanye’s frequent collaborator Malik Yusef told us during The Ringer Music Show. “They love what he presents to the world. And I think he was very self-deprecating in saying, ‘I’m an asshole. I’m bad. I’m terrible.’ But people took it tongue-in-cheek because they don’t believe it, because the art says that you’re great,” Yusef said. “I think that when he did ‘Runaway from me baby. I’m trouble.’ And we know what that does. That makes people say, ‘Well let me solve you.’”\n\nThe vocoder outro of “Runaway” is one of the most heart-wrenching moments of the past decade in popular music. It sonically communicates this primal sense of fear—fear of oneself, fear of what your actions have wrought, fear that you’ll never be able to reclaim what you once had. In essence, that’s always been and will always be Kanye’s singular gift and the root of his continuous downfall.\n",

          "description": "Every day, over 1 billion kilometers are driven with Google Maps in more than 220 countries and territories around the world. When you hop in your car or on your motorbike and start navigating, you’re instantly shown a few things: which way to go, whether the traffic along your route is heavy or light, an estimated travel time, and an estimated time of arrival (ETA). While all of this appears simple, there’s a ton going on behind the scenes to deliver this information in a matter of seconds.\n\nToday, we’ll break down one of our favorite topics: traffic and routing. If you’ve ever wondered just how Google Maps knows when there’s a massive traffic jam or how we determine the best route for a trip, read on. \n\nLive traffic, powered by drivers all around the world\n\nWhen people navigate with Google Maps, aggregate location data can be used to understand traffic conditions on roads all over the world. But while this information helps you find current traffic estimates —whether or not a traffic jam will affect your drive right now—it doesn’t account for what traffic will look like 10, 20, or even 50 minutes into your journey. This is where technology really comes into play.\n\nPredicting traffic with advanced machine learning techniques, and a little bit of history\n\nTo predict what traffic will look like in the near future, Google Maps analyzes historical traffic patterns for roads over time. For example, one pattern may show that the 280 freeway in Northern California typically has vehicles traveling at a speed of 65mph between 6-7am, but only at 15-20mph in the late afternoon. We then combine this database of historical traffic patterns with live traffic conditions, using machine learning to generate predictions based on both sets of data. \n\nRecently, we partnered with DeepMind, an Alphabet AI research lab, to improve the accuracy of our traffic prediction capabilities. Our ETA predictions already have a very high accuracy bar–in fact, we see that our predictions have been consistently accurate for over 97% of trips. By partnering with DeepMind, we’ve been able to cut the percentage of inaccurate ETAs even further by using a machine learning architecture known as Graph Neural Networks–with significant improvements in places like Berlin, Jakarta, São Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. This technique is what enables Google Maps to better predict whether or not you’ll be affected by a slowdown that may not have even started yet! \n\nKeeping it fresh\n\nFor most of the 13 years that Google Maps has provided traffic data, historical traffic patterns have been reliable indicators of what your conditions on the road could look like—but that's not always the case. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, traffic patterns around the globe have shifted dramatically. We saw up to a 50 percent decrease in worldwide traffic when lockdowns started in early 2020. Since then, parts of the world have reopened gradually, while others maintain restrictions. To account for this sudden change, we’ve recently updated our models to become more agile—automatically prioritizing historical traffic patterns from the last two to four weeks, and deprioritizing patterns from any time before that.\n\nHow Google Maps selects routes\n\nOur predictive traffic models are also a key part of how Google Maps determines driving routes. If we predict that traffic is likely to become heavy in one direction, we’ll automatically find you a lower-traffic alternative. We also look at a number of other factors, like road quality. Is the road paved or unpaved, or covered in gravel, dirt or mud? Elements like these can make a road difficult to drive down, and we’re less likely to recommend this road as part of your route. We also look at the size and directness of a road—driving down a highway is often more efficient than taking a smaller road with multiple stops.\n\nTwo other sources of information are important to making sure we recommend the best routes: authoritative data from local governments and real-time feedback from users. Authoritative data lets Google Maps know about speed limits, tolls, or if certain roads are restricted due to things like construction or COVID-19. And incident reports from drivers let Google Maps quickly show if a road or lane is closed, if there’s construction nearby, or if there’s a disabled vehicle or an object on the road. Both sources are also used to help us understand when road conditions change unexpectedly due to mudslides, snowstorms, or other forces of nature.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nSo how exactly does this all work in real life? Say you’re heading to a doctor’s appointment across town, driving down the road you typically take to get there. When you leave the house, traffic is flowing freely, with zero indication of any disruptions along the way. With Google Maps’ traffic predictions combined with live traffic conditions, we let you know that if you continue down your current route, there’s a good chance you’ll get stuck in unexpected gridlock traffic about 30 minutes into your ride—which would mean missing your appointment. As a result, Google Maps automatically reroutes you using its knowledge about nearby road conditions and incidents—helping you avoid the jam altogether and get to your appointment on time.\n\nPredicting traffic and determining routes is incredibly complex—and we'll keep working on tools and technology to keep you out of gridlock, and on a route that's as safe and efficient as possible.\n",

          "description": "By the third inning of Lucas Giolito’s start last night, a pattern emerged. The Pirates would attack him with lefties — they started seven left-handed batters — and Giolito would counter with his changeup. Cole Tucker, for example, faced three straight changeups after falling behind in the count 0-1. He managed to take the first one, but the second and third proved irresistible, and he fruitlessly waved at strike three:\n\nBy itself, there’s nothing remarkable about that sequence. Of course righties go to their changeup to combat opposite-handed pitchers — it’s only natural. Giolito has a good changeup, too. Why not use it? But these changeups were indicative of a larger trend, one that you could hardly avoid seeing last night as Giolito rampaged through the Pirates’s lineup on his way to a no-hitter: Giolito’s changeup is his best weapon, and he’s learning to trust it.\n\nIf you take a look at our Pitch Values, this is hardly a surprise. Giolito’s changeup is his most valuable on a per-pitch basis. The only year of his career it hasn’t produced better-than-average results was his 2016 cup of coffee in Washington; aside from that, it’s been a trusty companion, even when he wasn’t the pitcher he is today.\n\nThis year, however, he’s leaning into the pitch like never before. He threw 78 pitches to left-handed batters last night, and 36 were changeups. That 46.2% changeup rate was the third-highest he’s thrown in a single start. Four of his top five changeup rate starts have come this year:\n\nChangeup%, vs LHB, By Start\n\nDate\n\nLefty CH%\n\n7/6/19\n\n50.0%\n\n7/29/20\n\n47.5%\n\n8/25/20\n\n46.2%\n\n8/4/20\n\n41.3%\n\n8/20/20\n\n40.8%\n\nIn fact, he’s increased his usage of the pitch every year of his career:\n\nChangeup%, vs LHB, By Year\n\nYear\n\nLefty CH%\n\n2016\n\n12.6%\n\n2017\n\n20.3%\n\n2018\n\n21.2%\n\n2019\n\n33.2%\n\n2020\n\n38.3%\n\nLast night, that changeup usage paid off. He drew 13 swinging strikes on the pitch, a career high. He threw high fades, like this pitch to Tucker that ended the eighth:\n\nHe worked it below the zone, far too tempting for Jarrod Dyson to hold back:\n\nEven when he left one in the zone, the deception, speed change, and movement were too much for Gregory Polanco:\n\nThose three locations — really two locations, because the pitch to Polanco was probably the same rough idea as the one to Tucker — were the plan behind all of his changeups last night. Up and away, below the zone, or misses that drifted over the plate:\n\nWhile the changeup served to finish lefties off, it also helped set up Giolito’s fastball, and vice versa. Miss a changeup away, as JT Riddle did here:\n\nAnd you might still be thinking soft-and-away on this hard-and-in fastball:\n\nThat was a perfectly-located fastball for the situation. On 1-2, there’s no need to stay in the zone, and the downside isn’t hard contact but simply a ball or potentially a foul. Maybe a batter can make contact with that pitch, but it would take a superhuman effort to drive it to the outfield, much less over the fence.\n\nBetter fastball location has been a key to Giolito’s improvement, and he’s taken another step forward in it this year. In 2019, he made significant strides by simply throwing more strikes. He threw his fastball in the zone 57.3% of the time, a career high and four points higher than the overall league average. That aggressive approach put him ahead in counts and kept the pressure on hitters, but it came with a downside: he left 9.1% of his fastballs middle-middle (the league average was 8.2%), and as you might imagine, those pitches got hit hard.\n\nThis year, he’s dialed his zone-hunting back; he throws strikes at a roughly average rate. That’s come with a huge benefit; he’s cut his middle-middle percentage by two points, now 7.1%. That doesn’t mean he never misses, but there are fewer opportunities for hitters to take big hacks at centrally located pitches. Batting isn’t easy; you can get a good pitch to hit and still end up like Bryan Reynolds here:\n\nLeave a pitch there often enough and the batter is sure to win eventually. But Giolito gave the Pirates only three such cookies last night. Fail to cash in on those, and you’re looking at a steady diet of unhittable changeups and painted fastballs. It’s simply a numbers game, though the numbers won’t always work out as well as they did against the Pirates. Dropping from 9% to 7% is roughly one fastball per game the opposing team doesn’t get to take a cut at, and in the long run, that adds up.\n\nIn fact, that’s my main takeaway from last night. No one has ever been a good enough pitcher that you should expect a no-hitter in a given start. Baseball simply doesn’t work that way. Last night, however, Giolito gave himself a phenomenally good chance to hold the Pirates hitless. He started early; he got behind in the count 1-0 only seven times and got ahead 0-1 17 times.\n\nFrom there, he mostly gave the Pirates only bad choices. They couldn’t help but comply; they came up empty on 41% of their swings against his fastball, and that’s the easy one to hit. They whiffed on 56.5% of their swings against his changeup, and 72.7% of their swings against his slider when he deigned to throw it. He drew 30 swinging strikes last night, the highest total and percentage of swinging strikes for any starter this year. They’re a bad hitting team, one of the worst in baseball, but he also never gave them much of a chance.\n\nThat’s not to say the start was flawless. Thirteen strikeouts in a complete game means at least 14 balls in play, 14 chances for something to fall through. That’s a simple truth of pitching: you can’t avoid rolling the dice on a few balls in play, no matter how dominant you are.\n\nOne of the sticking points about sabermetric analysis of baseball is the role of luck in the game. The argument in favor of it is pretty clear: results follow a normal distribution in many cases, and the worst team beats the best team some amount of the time. No one would argue that baseball is deterministic. Thinking of the sport as a series of coin flips, though, robs it of some inherent drama. Is a no-hitter as impressive if it’s not a triumph of pitching but rather a string of 50/50 decisions coming up in Giolito’s favor?\n\nI think people misunderstand what sabermetricians mean by luck. I certainly don’t think of it the way I see it popularly described. Sure, batted balls are inherently a roll of the dice. Microscopic differences in initial contact can be the difference between a liner in the gap and a screamer directly at a fielder:\n\nThink of it this way, however. Have you ever woken up in the morning and felt an extra spring in your step? Ever thrown a ball around and thought “Wow, my arm is accurate today”? Of course you have, because it’s a natural part of the human condition. Do you have any agency over when it happens? Some, perhaps — you’re less likely to wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed after a night of partying — but for the most part, it’s simply a feeling you get in the morning at random, waking up on the right side of the bed, so to speak.\n\nLucas Giolito woke up on the right side of the bed yesterday. The Pirates hitters didn’t. Play that game, in those exact conditions with those players at that exact moment, 100 times, and you wouldn’t get 100 no-hitters. You would, however, get sheer dominance. Giolito wasn’t simply “getting lucky” when he blew fastballs by hapless batters, or went fishing with his changeup and hooked batters 13 times. He was in the zone, executing all three pitches and rarely missing location, he and James McCann divining hitters’ thinking and twisting them into pretzels.\n\nCall it luck if you’d like. It’s clearly not an average day for Giolito. Were he to pitch like this every time out, he’d be the best pitcher in baseball. But in the moment, I think it’s unfair to say he was simply “getting lucky.” On his best days, Giolito is capable of such a display. Those best days don’t happen frequently, of course. They happen far less often than his average days, and the average days are important, because seasons are built on average days.\n\nFor me, though, it’s a reminder of why it’s such a joy to watch a great pitcher. In the long run, randomness will prevail. Giolito will have some good starts and some bad starts, and the sum of his efforts will go down into statistical record. The average of those starts is what you can expect to see from him in a random game. But it’s not what you’ll actually get from him on a given night. Any start you watch could be the one where he’s feeling it, where he “deserves” the kind of performance we just saw, and there’s simply no way of knowing if you’ll witness it until you watch.\n\nLast night was a fluke, in a mathematical sense — most of the time, Giolito isn’t that good. And yet, it was no fluke. If he could replicate his true talent level from last night, not all his high and low points but simply his form at that exact moment, he’d break baseball. It won’t last. Next time out, he might be great again or might be average, and there’s no way to know until it happens. That’s the joy of a great pitching performance. It might not be likely, but when it happens, it feels almost inevitable — give or take an assist from Adam Engel.\n",

          "description": "The Chicago White Sox haven’t had a winning season since 2012 — and it’s been even longer since they were truly relevant. The last postseason series the South Siders won came in the 2005 World Series, when they beat the Houston Astros for their first championship since 1917. As a general rule, the Pale Hose are practically never among the most electrifying teams in baseball.\n\nThis year, however, is different. After a slightly rocky start to the season, the ChiSox have won nine of their last 12 games — including two of three against the crosstown rival Cubs over the weekend — raising their playoff chances to 94 percent according to the FiveThirtyEight prediction model. And they’re doing it with a very particular source of production: a record-breaking ensemble of Cuban-born stars.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the White Sox became the first team in MLB history to have an all-Cuban top four in their lineup when they started their contest against the Kansas City Royals off with center fielder Luis Robert, third baseman Yoán Moncada, first baseman José Abreu and catcher Yasmani Grandal hitting in order. (The quartet went 11-for-22 with 17 total bases in the game.) That group also dominated for the Sox against the Cubs this weekend, with 10 total home runs and 16 runs batted in.\n\nChicago has plenty of American-born talent on hand, of course, led most notably by shortstop Tim Anderson, who has an 1.063 on-base plus slugging with 1.3 wins above replacement1 already this season. It also has a wealth of Latin American talent from outside Cuba, headlined by Dominican left fielder Eloy Jiménez (0.7 WAR). But even so, it’s true that the White Sox would not be winning anywhere near as much — or be anywhere near as exciting to watch — without Robert, Moncada, Abreu and Grandal leading the way.\n\nIt’s early still, but no team has ever gotten as much from its Cuban players as those four are tracking to give Chicago in 2020. Together, the quartet has already generated 3.61 WAR in 29 games, which would work out to 20.2 WAR over a full, 162-game season. Going into this season, the MLB record for WAR (per 162 games) by Cuban players on one team was 14.6, by Zoilo Versalles, Tony Oliva, Camilo Pascual and Sandy Valdespino of the 1965 Minnesota Twins. That club came within a game of winning the World Series with a core of Latin American players signed by scout Joe Cambria while the team was still the Washington Senators, who also show up high on the list in 1959:\n\nThe White Sox have a historic Cuban connection\n\nMost wins above replacement (WAR) per 162 games generated by Cuban-born players for MLB teams in a single season, 1901-2020\n\nLatin-Born Players\n\nCuban-Born Players\n\nSeason\n\nTeam\n\nWAR*\n\nShare of Tm\n\nWAR*\n\nShare of Tm\n\n2020\n\nWhite Sox\n\n26.9\n\n45.9%\n\n20.2\n\n30.7%\n\n1965\n\nTwins\n\n14.6\n\n31.5\n\n14.6\n\n31.5\n\n1968\n\nIndians\n\n16.3\n\n39.1\n\n13.8\n\n32.7\n\n1964\n\nTwins\n\n12.5\n\n27.7\n\n12.6\n\n27.7\n\n1959\n\nSenators\n\n11.2\n\n38.4\n\n11.2\n\n38.4\n\n1970\n\nTwins\n\n16.5\n\n33.4\n\n10.9\n\n22.2\n\n1954\n\nWhite Sox\n\n16.3\n\n32.6\n\n10.7\n\n21.4\n\n1969\n\nTwins\n\n19.6\n\n36.4\n\n9.9\n\n18.5\n\n1923\n\nReds\n\n9.4\n\n21.3\n\n9.4\n\n21.3\n\n1962\n\nTwins\n\n10.7\n\n24.9\n\n9.1\n\n21.0\n\n1963\n\nTwins\n\n9.4\n\n18.4\n\n9.1\n\n17.9\n\n1963\n\nPhillies\n\n9.2\n\n21.6\n\n8.8\n\n20.7\n\n2019\n\nAstros\n\n21.1\n\n32.1\n\n8.4\n\n12.6\n\n1970\n\nAthletics\n\n10.0\n\n22.9\n\n8.1\n\n18.1\n\n1967\n\nIndians\n\n9.0\n\n29.8\n\n7.9\n\n23.7\n\n*Per 162 team games.\n\nSources: Baseball-Reference.com, FanGraphs\n\nThe 1968 Cleveland Indians, who rank third on the list above, also deserve mention for the stellar trio of starter Luis Tiant, center fielder José Cardenal and catcher Joe Azcue. (Tiant in particular had an incredible season that year, leading the American League with a 1.60 ERA.) But it’s also no coincidence that the majority of teams on the list are concentrated in a very tight range of seasons. Aside from the Senators, most teams had not considered Latin America as a serious source of talent — to their great detriment — until the 1950s. (Cincinnati Reds pitcher Dolf Luque stood out in the 1920s,2 but he was very much the exception.) What followed was an era of Latino stars who rose to become some of the best in baseball, led by the likes of Tiant, Pascual, Versalles, Puerto Rico’s Roberto Clemente, Juan Marichal of the Dominican Republic and Tony Pérez of Cuba. Chicago even had its own Cuban superstar in Minnie Miñoso, who starred for the Sox in four different decades.\n\nUnfortunately, MLB’s Cuban heyday came to an end around when the United States began an embargo against the country in 1960, forcing countless subsequent stars into a terrible choice between defecting (which can be a dangerous act for numerous reasons) and giving up their major-league dreams to play for far less than their worth on government-owned teams. It’s no coincidence that, as the generation of players who began their careers in the 1950s — and starred through the 1970s — retired, there was a huge dropoff in Cuban production at the MLB level:\n\nThat trend reversed some in the late 1980s and into the ’90s, as José Canseco and Rafael Palmeiro emerged as perennial All-Stars — though both grew up in Miami after their parents left Fidel Castro’s Cuba for the U.S. An arguably greater watershed moment came with pitcher Liván Hernández’s midnight defection in 1995, aided by scout Joe Cubas. Hernández dominated the 1997 postseason, earning World Series MVP honors with the Florida Marlins, and his brother Orlando made a harrowing journey to America by boat several months later. Along with countryman José Contreras, the Hernández brothers starred for six World Series champions from 1997 through 2005, powering a Cuban revival in the 21st century.\n\nThat renaissance continued with the emergence of such talented Cuban hitters as Yunel Escobar, Kendrys Morales, Alexei Ramírez, Leonys Martín, Yoenis Céspedes and Yasiel Puig, to go with a new generation of fireballing pitchers headlined by Aroldis Chapman and José Fernández. The same era also helped produce Robert, Moncada, Abreu and Grandal — all building blocks behind the White Sox’s impressive 2020 season.\n\nAbreu landed in Chicago first, signing as an international free agent in 2013 and winning Rookie of the Year honors in his debut season the following year. He has generated 21.0 WAR in his career, or 3.0 per season — fourth most of any Cuban player ever, behind Fernández, Palmeiro and Tiant — with a career OPS 36 percent better than league average. So far this year, he’s been the South Siders’ best player with 11 home runs and 1.6 WAR.\n\nThen came Moncada, who was acquired from the Boston Red Sox in 2016 as part of the Chris Sale trade — which cost Chicago an all-time pitcher but gained them one of the best young infielders in all of baseball. Since the start of 2019, only four third basemen — Alex Bregman, Anthony Rendon, Matt Chapman and Nolan Arenado — have more WAR than Moncada’s 6.0 mark, and Moncada (who turned 25 in May) is younger than any of them.\n\nRobert arrived next, after defecting in the winter of 2016-17. Although he hasn’t been quite as good as Abreu, he might be the most exciting player in Chicago — if not the entire major leagues — in 2020 so far:\n\nThough he strikes out a ton (in 36 percent of plate appearances, to be exact), Robert hits the ball hard, runs very fast and has been one of the best defensive center fielders in baseball this year. Robert may be a rookie, but the second-best prospect in all of baseball going into the season3 hasn’t really needed much of an adjustment period before excelling against MLB competition.\n\nThe final piece, Grandal, was added as a free agent last fall after enjoying a solid 2019 season (3.8 WAR) with the Milwaukee Brewers. After coming to America as a child under a special Cuban immigration lottery, Grandal lived and went to college in Miami before being taken with the 12th overall pick in the 2010 draft. Including 2020, he’s been the second-best catcher in baseball by WAR (behind Buster Posey) since first becoming a regular in 2014.\n\nTogether, the White Sox’s Cuban connection has been the primary force behind the team’s long-awaited breakout season. They have hit 26 combined home runs with an .863 OPS and 206 total bases. They’ve also produced a little less than one-third of the team’s WAR, with Abreu and Robert in particular ranking as two of the team’s three best players (sandwiched around Anderson). No other team in baseball history has showcased Cuban talent so front and center, and there will likely be more where that came from as the season goes on.\n\nThe White Sox’s success is also another milestone in the evolution of MLB’s Cuban players, whose contributions have grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade. Back in 2016, it looked like the influx of players from Cuba would increase even more dramatically after then-President Barack Obama loosened the U.S.’s embargo on the country. A couple of years later, MLB had even agreed with the Cuban government to streamline the path for players to play in America. That agreement was scuttled, however, when the Trump administration declared it illegal last year. But even if the relationship between countries remains fraught, Cuba’s baseball talent can’t be denied — and there’s no greater proof of that than the turnaround transpiring in Chicago this summer.\n\nCheck out our latest MLB predictions.\n",

          "description": "Although sometimes overlooked, hotel credit cards can be a lucrative addition to any wallet.\n\nMany of these cards offer generous sign-up bonuses, incredible hotel redemptions and free-night perks. Today, we’ll take a closer look at two mid-tier hotel credit cards: The World of Hyatt Credit Card and the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card. Both cards have a reasonable $95 annual fee (see rates and fees for Hilton Surpass), especially when considering some of the benefits that you’ll receive on them.\n\nWant more credit card news and travel advice? Sign up for the daily TPG newsletter.\n\nPersonally, I have both of these cards in my wallet. And while they each get used, there is one that comes out on top. Let’s take a deeper dive into these two similar hotel cards to see which may be a better fit for you.\n\nRelated: Why I went all-in on the Hyatt card during the pandemic\n\nIn This Post\n\nBoth cards at a glance\n\nHere is a high-level overview of each card and their respective benefits.\n\nEach World of Hyatt point is worth 1.7 cents, while each Hilton Honors point is worth 0.6 cents, according to TPG valuations.\n\n \n\nRelated: Review of the Hilton Surpass card and Review of The World of Hyatt card \n\nWelcome offer\n\nThe Hilton Surpass currently has a welcome offer of 125,000 Hilton Honors points after you spend $2,000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. \n\nMeanwhile, The World of Hyatt Credit Card staggers its sign-up offer. You’ll first receive 25,000 Hyatt points after you spend $3,000 in the first three months. Then if you spend a total of $6,000 within the first six months of card opening, you’ll get another 25,000 points.\n\nThe Hyatt card is issued by Chase, which means it’s subject to the restrictions of 5/24. That essentially means you will not be approved for this card if you have opened five or more personal credit cards across all banks in the last 24 months.\n\nRelated: The award traveler’s guide to Hilton Honors and The ultimate guide to The World of Hyatt \n\nWhich is better?\n\nOn paper, the Hilton Surpass card should easily beat out the Hyatt card. Not only do you get double the points, but you also have to spend less than half of what the Hyatt card requires. However, the sheer number of points only tells part of the story. As mentioned above, our TPG valuation pegs Hilton Honors points at almost less than a third of what The World of Hyatt points are worth.\n\nWaldorf Astoria Maldives (Photo by Brian Kelly / The Points Guy)\n\nIn the real world, the number of Hilton points required for a hotel redemption is closely tied to the cash equivalent of how much it costs per night. Therefore, it’s harder (but certainly possible) to get more value on a per point basis. However, Hyatt has a fixed award chart that can provide outsized value when compared to paying in cash.\n\nWith all of that said, I personally find more value in 50,000 Hyatt points compared to 125,000 Hilton points — even with more spending required to reach that bonus threshold. And in terms of a TPG valuation perspective, 50,000 Hyatt points are worth $850, while 125,000 Hilton points are worth $750.\n\nWinner: The World of Hyatt Credit Card\n\nMain benefits and features\n\nThe long-term value in a card is not in a sign-up bonus, but what perks and benefits are offered that you can make use of regularly.\n\nElite status\n\nBoth the Hilton Surpass and The World of Hyatt card both offer elite status with their respective brands, but the Hilton card goes one step further.\n\nInstead of including entry-level Hilton Silver status, Surpass cardholders actually receive automatic Hilton Gold status. TPG Points Lab Editor Nick Ewen values Hilton Gold at $1,260. Gold status includes perks such as bonus points on stays, space-available room upgrades up to executive rooms and complimentary breakfast at all hotels. If you spend more than $40,000 on the card in a calendar year, you’ll be bumped to top-tier Hilton Diamond status through the end of the next calendar year.\n\nWyndhurst Manor & Club, a Hyatt property (Photo by Chris Dong/The Points Guy)\n\nMeanwhile, The World of Hyatt cardholders get automatic entry-level Discoverist status, which comes with benefits such as late checkout, preferred rooms and a 10% points bonus on eligible purchases. According to our Points Lab valuations, Discoverist status is worth only $160.\n\nRelated: 5 easy ways to maximize The World of Hyatt program \n\nFree night award\n\nBoth of these mid-tier hotel cards offer a free night award, but differ in terms of how you earn it.\n\nFor the Hilton Surpass, you’ll receive a complimentary weekend night reward after you spend $15,000 on purchases on your card in a calendar year. You can use this free night at almost any Hilton property worldwide as long as your stay is on a weekend night, which is defined as a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night in most of the world. Even the most expensive Hilton properties (think: Conrads, Waldorfs and more) qualify to use this free night reward.\n\nConrad Bora Bora (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)\n\nBecause of the pandemic, unexpired free weekend night certificates — plus those issued through Dec. 31, 2020 — can now be used on any night of the week. Also, those issued between now and Dec. 31, 2020 will be valid for 24 months from the date of issuance (rather than the usual 12 months)\n\nThe World of Hyatt card offers an annual free-night certificate at a Category 1-4 Hyatt property which you’ll receive every account anniversary. This is worth much more than the card’s $95 annual fee, but also does not include more premium properties in the Hyatt portfolio. However, you’ll also get a second free Category 1-4 night after spending $15,000 during your cardmember year.\n\nWhen compared to the Surpass, you’ll essentially be getting two free nights versus one night on the Hilton — with the caveat being the Hilton night can be at a super high-end property (and only on weekends). There are clear pros and cons for each card with this perk.\n\nRelated: Best uses of Hyatt free-night certificates\n\nOther benefits\n\nThe Hilton Surpass is unique in that it offers a Priority Pass Select membership, although it won’t allow you unlimited access to lounges. Instead, you’ll receive 10 lounge passes every membership year once enrolled.\n\nThe Priority Pass-accessible Air France lounge at JFK. (Photo by Nick Ellis/The Points Guy)\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any lounge perks, the Hyatt card does give you the opportunity to spend your way toward higher levels of status.\n\nYou can earn five elite-qualifying nights every year you have the card, with the opportunity to earn even more elite credit. For a limited-time through Aug. 31, 2020, that is bumped up to 10 elite nights for the first year. Also, every $5,000 spent on the card will normally earn you two additional qualifying nights.\n\nBoth the Hilton Surpass and The World of Hyatt card have similar travel and purchase protection perks, although the Hyatt card does get a slight edge in trip delay benefits.\n\nWinner: Hilton Surpass\n\nEarning points\n\nWith the Hilton Surpass, you’ll receive Hilton Honors points at the following rates:\n\n12x at participating Hilton hotels\n\n6x at U.S. restaurants and U.S. gas stations\n\n3x on all other purchases\n\nAdditionally, bonus points earned through eligible purchases that post to the card member’s Hilton Honors account between now and Dec. 31, 2020 will be considered base points and will count towards elite tier qualification and lifetime Diamond status. \n\nRelated: What’s the best Hilton card for you? \n\nMeanwhile, the World of Hyatt card earns bonus points with these categories:\n\n4x at participating Hyatt hotels\n\n2x on local transit and commuting, restaurants, airline tickets purchased directly, fitness clubs and gym memberships\n\n1x on all other purchases\n\nAs you can see, the Hyatt card’s earnings are about one-third of that of the Hilton Surpass. This falls basically in line with our TPG valuation. Since the Hyatt card has more bonus categories (and ones that are more relevant for me), I’m giving the slight edge to that card.\n\nWinner: The World of Hyatt card\n\nRedeeming points\n\nFor both of these cards, your best bet will be to redeem for hotel stays with each respective brand. With the ongoing pandemic, you also have much more flexibility in terms of changing and canceling reservations — even when using points. \n\nHilton has a much larger global footprint than Hyatt so take that into consideration if deciding which card is a better fit for you.\n\nYou can use your Hyatt free night certificate at the Category 4 Andaz San Diego (Photo courtesy of Andaz San Diego)\n\nWith Hilton Honors, there is no award chart to determine how many points you need for a particular stay. This makes it difficult to determine how many points you’ll need until you actually are ready to book. However, Hilton does have a Points Explorer tool that allows you to check the maximum number of points required to book a standard room at a particular property or for multiple properties in a specific area.\n\nRelated: The best hotel cards that come with an annual free night\n\nMeanwhile, the best way to redeem World of Hyatt points is for free nights and upgrades. You also have the option to redeem points for dining, spa visits, Lindblad Expeditions and other experiences, but you’re almost always better off using points for hotel rooms.\n\nRedemptions for standard rooms start at 5,000 points per night at Category 1 hotels and 40,000 per night at Category 8 hotels. Premium suites go for as much as 60,000 points per night at Category 7 hotels.\n\nIn general, awards are typically lower in cost than other programs and there are some amazing opportunities to get a lot of value from your Hyatt points, more so than Hilton.\n\nWinner: The World of Hyatt card\n\nWhich card is better for you?\n\nAt the end of the day, the card that is better suited for you may come down to brand and loyalty preference. In general, I find The World of Hyatt program to be much more lucrative, but the Hilton Gold elite status benefits may also be enticing for the $95 annual fee Hilton Surpass (see rates & fees).\n\nBreakfast with a view was free at Conrad Bora Bora thanks to Hilton Gold status (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)\n\nAnother consideration is that both the Hilton Honors program and World of Hyatt program partner with transferable points currencies. You can transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to Hilton and you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt. Transferable points are a powerful tool. If you don’t have enough points with a specific program, you can easily shift points over from another program.\n\nKeep in mind that the Hilton Surpass card also has a more expensive big brother, the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card, that offers automatic Diamond status and an annual free weekend night reward just for holding the card. Additionally, The Platinum Card® from American Express comes with Hilton Honors Gold status as an automatic benefit.\n\nThe World of Hyatt card has no such premium cobranded card offering or any other card that provides Hyatt status.\n\nRelated: Should I get the World of Hyatt Credit Card or transfer points from Chase instead?\n\nBottom line\n\nIn this showdown, I’m giving a slight edge to The World of Hyatt card. That’s because it has a superior loyalty program with lower-priced redemptions and the ability to earn two free night rewards over the course of a cardmember year with $15,000 in spend.\n\nHowever, your needs may be different from mine. You can’t forget about the Chase 5/24 rule. Overall, it’s well worth evaluating what you find most useful in a cobranded hotel credit card. There also is a compelling case to pick up both cards and split your loyalty between two hotel programs — that is exactly what I do.\n\nFor rates and fees of the Hilton Surpass card, click here.\n\nRelated: The best hotel credit cards of 2020\n\nFeatured photo by John Gribben / The Points Guy\n\n \n\nThe World of Hyatt card\n\nHilton Surpass card\n\nWelcome offer\n\nUp to 50,000 points: 25,000 points after you spend $3,000 in the first three months, plus an additional 25,000 points after you spend $6,000 total on purchases within the first six months of account opening\n\n125,000 Hilton Honors points after you spend $2,000 in purchases within the first three months\n\nFree night award?\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nHow the free night works\n\nEarn a free night at a Category 1-4 Hyatt hotel or resort every year after your cardmember anniversary AND an extra free Category 1-4 night after spending $15,000 during cardmember year\n\nEarn a Free Weekend Night Reward after you spend $15,000 on eligible purchases on your card in a calendar year\n\nEarning points\n\n4x at participating Hyatt hotels\n\n2x on local transit and commuting, restaurants, airline tickets purchased directly, fitness clubs and gym memberships\n\n1x on all other purchases\n\n12x at participating Hilton hotels\n\n6x at U.S. restaurants and U.S. gas stations\n\n3x on all other purchases\n\nRedeeming points\n\nFixed award chart with nightly redemptions starting at 5,000 Hyatt points\n\nDynamic award chart\n",

          "description": "Since COVID-19 has many of us working from home, boundaries between work and life are slipping further into the distance. This also inevitably causes us to put a magnifying glass to our living spaces, and many designers predict this shift in thinking will have lasting changes on home interior design.\n\nAfter all, we have past epidemics to thank for home innovations like the ubiquity of easy-to-disinfect subway tile and front porches. COVID has put a swift stop to the expectation of 40-plus hours in an office and hours-long weekly commutes; how will this change what we tolerate when it comes to how our home spaces are organized?\n\nStudio Belem's vision for future homes shows sliding panels replacing permanent walls (via World Economic Forum)\n\nDesigners and architects are busy envisioning ways to alleviate stressors like safety concerns in small spaces such as our apartments as well as potential work/life imbalances. A recent profile by the World Economic Forum on designers working in this new space show a number of examples alluding to how home interiors will change with work from home becoming the new normal. Studio Belem, an architecture studio based in Paris, recently shared their a new living space concept in response to coronavirus that includes sliding panels to replace static walls and modular, integrated furniture systems. Belem co-founder Edouard Bettencourt tells World Economic Forum, \"There are no corridors, as this is wasted space...The bedrooms are all set next to each other. You use slidable panels, which can completely open or close rooms as you like.\"\n\nVitra's Dancing Wall System by Studio Hurlemann (via The Spaces)\n\nUnsurprisingly, designers working on these future concepts are inspired by home layouts in Japan and other highly saturated cities as well as the tiny home movement; use cases where modular designs stem from the need to maximize incredibly sparse square footage. Given the trend, we're likely to see trends such as dual purpose features, like a tiny home bathroom door that also functions as a loft ladder, or a modular divider wall doubling as shelving similar to Vitra's Dancing Wall system. Beds might move up a floor and lofts gain more popularity as apartment-dwellers will want to maximize floor space for working and other daytime activities.\n\nThis tiny house packs a number of modular features, including a storage system that houses a retractable staircase for access to the house's loft bed (via Curbed)\n\nCompanies like Ori Systems, who for years have promoted a new kind of modular living aided by robotic systems that can transform the functionality of rooms with the touch of a button, can expect to see competitors arise who provide even more economically feasible solutions as demand for more tolerable home/work space rises.\n\n Ori Studio Suite from Ori on Vimeo.\n\nModular layouts also perhaps mean the impending death of the open floor plan as we know it, made popular by the likes of HGTV quick-flip television shows. In a feature with Dwell in March, Gray Organschi Architecture founding partner Lisa Gray reinforces her love for design open plans while also stating that \"it's also incredibly important to be able to go and close a door even if it's in a tiny tiny place. This has always been needed for mental health and privacy, but it's now needed so that people can get their work done.\" As we spend more time at home, there will be a push in design to create barriers signifying a separation between home and work life that also serve as a reclamation of privacy for individuals in the home.\n\nWhile we don't know how long COVID-19 will linger, it is indisputable at this point that it will forever change many aspects of our lives. And as we spend more time in our homes, inevitably noticing our living spaces' current flaws and inefficiencies, it's likely the home interior revolution will come sooner than we may even imagine.\n",

          "description": "The GrillGrate will improve the performance of just about any gas grill. Bonus: if you drop an asparagus spear, it won't fall down into the grill's depths. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]\n\nThere's a lot to like about gas grills, and by a lot, I really mean one thing: They're easy. No matter how much we might celebrate a live charcoal fire, the bottom line is it can't compete with the convenience of turning on and off the burner dials of a gas grill. For casual weeknight grilling, that convenience is worth an awful lot.\n\nAnd yet how many nights have I stood before a gas grill at a friend's house or vacation rental, pushing meat and vegetables around the grate in search of the one or two zones just barely hot enough to actually get a good sear? Too many.\n\nThis is probably the moment when someone fires off a #notallgasgrills, and yeah, sure, there are exceptions. But the uneven heating and underpowered performance is, in my experience, the norm. Even with lengthy preheating with the lid closed, searing-level heat is short-lived; before long, the cool food begins to win out, dropping the heat on much of the grill. Then you're back to the same old ritual, rotating ingredients through those few precious hot spots to eke out a result that kinda-sorta resembles grilled food.\n\nSo last year, when AmazingRibs.com's Clint Cantwell included a product called the GrillGrate in his guide to essential grilling gear, I knew I needed to try it for myself. We have a small one-burner gas grill in one of the cooktops in the Serious Eats test kitchen, making it easy to try out.\n\nI did my tests, we took photos, and I intended to write it up, but by then grilling season* was slowing down so I decided to wait until after winter. When coronavirus hit in early spring, right when I should have been publishing this, I forgot all about it. Now here we are, thankfully still with enough time left in grilling season for this to be helpful to many of you.\n\n*I know, I know: \"Every season is grilling season.\" Do this job long enough and you, too, can anticipate every cheeky comment before some clever reader has had the chance to hit \"post.\"\n\nAnd now I can finally tell you what I've told pretty much every single gas-grill owner I've talked to since I ran my tests: If you really want to turn your grill into a beast, you need to get a GrillGrate. (Yes, I sound like a shill. No, this is not an ad—I really am this enthusiastic about it.)\n\nThere are two problems with most gas grills. First, the burners tend to run in rows with spaces in between, creating alternating hot and cold spots across the width of the grill. Second, those burners are rarely hot enough to maintain ideal searing temps. The best spots are usually in the back close to where the lid attaches to the grill by its hinge, possibly because the lid manages to trap more heat back there. But it's never a big enough hot zone to get a good sear on most of the food, especially not meats that are at risk of overcooking if they're left on too long.\n\nThe GrillGrate doesn't just sear evenly, it cooks hotter by trapping the gas grill's heat.\n\nThe GrillGrate's design fixes this. Each GrillGrate is a sheet of aluminum that has raised fins running along its length on one side—these fins act as the bars on a standard grill grate. The aluminum sheet manages to trap much more heat under it than the wide-open spaces of a traditional grill grate can, building significantly more heat and searing ability. And the aluminum itself is a great conductor of heat—much, much better than the cast iron and stainless steel common to the grates on most grills—which helps even out those hot and cool spots.\n\nBetween the fins, meanwhile, are perforations in the aluminum sheet, which allow hot air and smoke to travel up from below, paving the way for the kinds of combustion and smoke that make grilled food taste grilled. And yet, once again thanks to that aluminum sheet, dripping fats are largely prevented from flowing down onto the grill's flames, reducing flare-ups and the unpleasant flavors that come with them.\n\nGas grills are infamous for uneven browning and charring, such as on the chicken here. Flare-ups, meanwhile, are common when liquified fats drop down onto a gas grill's flames, as seen here. The GrillGrate's perforated aluminum sheet evens out cooking and suppresses flare-ups for better results.\n\nThere are some other cool tricks you can do with a GrillGrate. You can, for example, sprinkle some wood pellets down into the troughs between the fins for some quick blasts of smoke. And you can flip the GrillGrate over so that the perforated flat aluminum sheet becomes the top side, turning it into a pretty kick-ass plancha. And depending on whether you want to even out the heating across the entire surface of your grill or create distinct high- and low-heat zones, you can either link the GrillGrate panels together so that they conduct heat into each other, or disconnect them so that one set over a higher burner won't spread its heat into an adjacent one set over a burner set to a lower heat.\n\nIn my tests, the differences in results were clear. On our gas grill's standard grill grate, meat and vegetables blackened excessively in some spots while under-searing in others. On the GrillGrate, everything seared quickly and evenly all over.\n\nOn the GrillGrate, chicken and asparagus browned evenly all over.\n\nSetting the GrillGrate up on your grill is easy. The company offers a number of configurations pre-cut to fit many popular grill models, but you can also go the custom route by measuring your own grill and having them cut the pieces to fit. You can then set the GrillGrate on top of your existing grill grate, or remove the old one and replace it.\n\nOnce the GrillGrate enters the picture, gas grills make quite the compelling argument: Convenient to use, with amazing results. The case for charcoal just took a big hit.\n\nAll products linked here have been independently selected by our editors.

          "description": "Source: Morgan Stanley\n\n \n \nMorgan Stanley has a fascinating report on reduced number of publicly traded companies, and the rise of SPACs, Buyout funds, and Private Equity:\n\n \n\nOver the past quarter century there has been a marked shift in U.S. equities from public markets to private markets controlled by buyout and venture capital firms. This change has had reverberations for asset managers, investors, executives, and policy makers. In this report we seek to answer the following questions:\n\n• What have been the major drivers behind the shift from public to private equities in the U.S.?\n• Why are there fewer public companies today than there were 25 years ago?\n• What are the long-term trends in buyouts?\n• What are the long-term trends in venture capital?\n• Where do we go from here?\n\nMarkets have become more sophisticated over time as the result of the growth in institutional money management, financial innovation, and sharply lower technology costs. Large institutional investors, including pension funds and endowments, face the prospect of swelling future liabilities and diminished expected returns for most asset classes. As a result, they have reduced their portfolio allocation to public securities and have increased their allocation to private equity, where returns have historically been higher.\n\nFrom the end of World War II through the early 1970s, many companies went public to raise capital to fund their growth. Today, young companies often rely more on intangible assets and have a less voracious appetite for capital. They also have unprecedented access to capital through the private markets. Consequently, many young companies have elected to stay private longer than did the companies of prior generations.\n\n \n\nMore charts after the jump\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAll data and text sourced from: Morgan Stanley\n\n \n\nThe post Public to Private Equity appeared first on The Big Picture.\n",

          "description": "MacKenzie Scott (then Bezos) at an awards ceremony in 2018. | Jörg Carstensen/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nIn the past year, she’s given away $1.7 billion.\n\nA year ago, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos set records with the world’s biggest divorce settlement. On July 28, MacKenzie Bezos (now MacKenzie Scott) announced that she’s spent the time since aiming to set a much more inspiring record — for how fast she can give the money away.\n\nWhen the couple divorced in 2019, they were splitting the largest personal fortune in history, estimated at the time at about $145 billion. The couple announced a settlement in April 2019 that left Jeff Bezos 75 percent of his Amazon fortune, while Scott departed the marriage with $35 billion, making her at the time of the announcement the third-richest woman in the world (a recent Forbes ranking now has her at fourth).\n\nRight away, Scott indicated that her approach to philanthropy would be profoundly different from the approach she and Bezos had used as a couple. Jeff Bezos’s forays into philanthropy have been limited. While the wealthiest man in the world, he has not signed the Giving Pledge to eventually donate a significant share of his wealth, and he’s donated a far smaller percentage of it than other ultra-wealthy figures like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, or Mike Bloomberg. When he has given, I’ve criticized his approach for a lack of rigor and clarity.\n\nOne month after the divorce, Scott signed the Giving Pledge that Bezos never did. “I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,” she wrote in her pledge letter. “I won’t wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.” And it seems like she’s been acting on that declaration.\n\nMacKenzie Scott’s deeply unusual approach to philanthropy\n\nA year later, she has published an update, and it’s an astonishing one. In the past year, she has donated $1.7 billion to 116 organizations working in areas of interest to her, from racial justice and LGBTQ equality to climate change and global health.\n\nAll the organizations listed are established nonprofits, selected, Scott says, for their leadership’s “track record of effective management and significant impact in their fields.” The largest area of grants — $586.7 million — went to organizations working on racial equity, an issue where awareness has grown quickly over the past few months amid protests sparked by George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Other top priorities included economic mobility ($399.5 million), gender equity, public health, and global development (more on these below).\n\nThe total amount — $1.7 billion — is obviously just a fraction of her fortune, but it is deeply unusual for billionaires to give away that much money this quickly, especially without a preexisting organization to do grant research and vetting.\n\nHer methods, too, are unusual. “It was a gift that just fell from the sky,” Jorge Valencia, executive director and CEO of one of those 116 organizations, the Point Foundation, told the Chronicle of Philanthropy. The organization, which offers scholarships to LGBTQ+ students, did not apply for a grant and had no connection to Scott.\n\nAnd while it’s common for philanthropists to give grants that are restricted for a specific purpose, paid out over the course of several years or conditional on various benchmarks for grant success, Scott says she did none of that. “I gave each a contribution and encouraged them to spend it on whatever they believe best serves their efforts. Unless organization leadership requested otherwise, all commitments were paid up front and left unrestricted to provide them with maximum flexibility,” she wrote in her announcement.\n\n“It’s an interesting contrast to the more technocratic giving of the tech billionaires,” Rob Reich, a Stanford philosopher who writes about the role of philanthropy in society, told me.\n\nAnother interesting contrast is the way Scott approached publicizing her giving. The announcement two years ago that Jeff Bezos planned to give $2 billion to education and homelessness charities attracted, Reich says, “fanfare with zero follow-up.” Almost two years later, the website for Bezos’s Day One Fund lists just under $200 million in grants, about 10 percent of the amount initially pledged. Half of the initial pledge was for education, and no progress in this area has been officially announced yet (though Bezos has posted updates on Instagram).\n\nIn 2020, Bezos announced on Instagram a planned $10 billion in grants to fight climate change through what he called the Bezos Earth Fund. The Bezos Earth Fund has no website. Bezos’s original Instagram post says that grants will start this summer, though they appear to have not yet started.\n\nAll this is not unusual (and it doesn’t suggest that Bezos won’t eventually meet his commitments; he has paid out other grants he’s made, including $100 million to Feeding America for coronavirus relief earlier this year). Typically, philanthropic announcements get widespread coverage even if they are substantially in advance of the actual disbursement of money. And in some cases, money is disbursed to donor-advised funds or other instruments, which means they may take even longer to reach recipients. There is nothing wrong with taking your time to make grants if that means the grants do more good — but it’s easy for delays to mean that givers enjoy all the positive publicity of a major grant long before anyone’s life is improved by it.\n\nScott, by announcing her gifts only after she’d already disbursed all the money, avoids that pitfall — and could offer a glimpse of a new model of how to give, one that is focused on moving money quickly, not attaching any requirements or conditions, and shifting the power dynamics of the philanthropy world.\n\nDoes this model of giving work?\n\nScott’s fast, massive disbursements and other recent experiments in quickly moving large sums of money to where they are needed, with much less review and fewer application steps than in traditional grantmaking, “weakens the case that giving away $1.7 billion is difficult,” Reich said. “There remains a question about whether it’s difficult to do well.”\n\nGiving away money very quickly with a minimal process does have some disadvantages.\n\nMany charitable interventions don’t work, and the differences between the best organizations and the average organizations can be quite large. It’s reasonable that many funders don’t want to take that chance.\n\nBut there’s a good argument that at least some funders should be happy to make lots of grants, many of which may disappoint them anyway. Vetting often adds lots of overhead, delays, and communication problems for charities; a faster process that gets money where it’s needed sooner can make a big difference. In some specific fields (say, scientific research), studies have shown that all the effort-intensive work to find the “best” grants is fairly arbitrary; researchers don’t agree with each other’s rankings at all. In a case like that, you might as well just get money out the door, with minimal vetting — as Scott has done.\n\nAnd in some areas, like coronavirus relief, getting money to people quickly is really important. If it takes months to make a grant and more months for the money to arrive, it may be too late to help. Scott donated to GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that gives people cash, no strings attached, and which has dramatically expanded its operations this year in order to help people around the world deal with the coronavirus crisis.\n\nScott’s team reached out to GiveDirectly after having already done their research, GiveDirectly’s managing director Joe Huston told me. Very little staff time was tied up in making the donation happen. (The nonprofit tracks how many resources are expended per dollar raised and said that Scott’s gift was one of the lowest-scoring, on that metric, they could remember.) The money arrived in early June, and 95 percent of it was sent out to recipients within 10 days.\n\n“The pandemic is giving donors experience in handing over the reins in philanthropy,” Huston told me, so that help can reach people as fast as it’s needed. “My hope is that when people are just looking to help, they’ll start with that in general.”\n\nThere are other pitfalls to trying to give away money quickly, though Scott avoided many of the biggest ones. Lots of donors making large gifts gravitate toward targets like Stanford, Harvard, or MIT — big research universities with well-staffed donor relations departments that can absorb enormous gifts. (“For the love of God, rich people, stop giving Ivy League colleges money,” my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote after one such mega-gift, and I agree.) Scott donated to several historically Black colleges and universities; in each case, her donation of $20 million to $40 million was the largest single donation in the school’s history.\n\nThe money will help ”lift the financial burden off of deserving students and help make ends meet so they can focus on graduating on time,” Howard University said in a statement. “This pure act of benevolence is clearly a game-changer and it could not have come at a better time,” Hampton president William R. Harvey told the HBCU Digest.\n\nIn general, picking organizations run by people affected firsthand by the injustices Scott targeted was a priority. “On this list, 91 percent of the racial-equity organizations are run by leaders of color, 100 percent of the LGBTQ+ equity organizations are run by LGBTQ+ leaders, and 83 percent of the gender-equity organizations are run by women, bringing lived experience to solutions for imbalanced social systems,” she wrote in her note announcing the gifts.\n\nThat fact might provide a useful lens for evaluating her donations. MacKenzie Scott does not know how to solve racial justice, women’s rights, or LGBTQ+ equality. She just happens to, unlike most of us, be in possession of $35 billion, and so she decided that if she gave much of that money to Black activists and LGBTQ+ activists and women’s activists, probably they would be better suited than she is to figure out how the money could be spent to solve those problems.\n\nThe same theme recurs in Scott’s letter and in nonprofits’ descriptions of her process. There wasn’t very much vetting because Scott does not particularly expect that she’s better at vetting than these organizations are. There weren’t restrictions on the grants because Scott does not particularly believe she’s more suited than the recipients to guess what restrictions would be useful. She is “trusting the leaders of the organizations chosen,” Reich told me, “with a very deliberate eye toward leaders with the lived experience of the work they’re doing.”\n\nThere’s something deeply inspiring about that. I am in favor of philanthropists putting in the work to identify the most effective approaches to social problems and direct their money with precision where it will do the most good, when they have the resources to do that. I think that work is often well worth the effort.\n\n“There’s room for the bigger foundations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that kind of heavyweight model,” Huston told me when I asked whether more philanthropists should be imitating Scott. “But I’m glad there’s more examples, like [MacKenzie] Bezos, like Twitter’s Jack Dorsey,” where philanthropists make donation decisions quickly and trust the decision-making to others.\n\nIf you have $35 billion, that fact does not in itself make you qualified to figure out how to fix the world — and if you think that other people are more qualified, you might decide the best plan is to just shovel the money out the door so they can run with it. That seems to be MacKenzie Scott’s approach to philanthropy so far — and a society grappling with the role of billionaires in our world and in our giving should be watching.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we’ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world’s biggest challenges — and how to get better at doing good.\n\nSupport Vox’s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

          "description": "That is the topic of my latest Bloomberg column, here is one excerpt:\n\nAs a very rough description, think of GPT-3 as giving computers a facility with words that they have had with numbers for a long time, and with images since about 2012.\n\nThe core of GPT-3, which is a creation of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence company based in San Francisco, is a general language model designed to perform autofill. It is trained on uncategorized internet writings, and basically guesses what text ought to come next from any starting point. That may sound unglamorous, but a language model built for guessing with 175 billion parameters — 10 times more than previous competitors — is surprisingly powerful.\n\nThe eventual uses of GPT-3 are hard to predict, but it is easy to see the potential. GPT-3 can converse at a conceptual level, translate language, answer email, perform (some) programming tasks, help with medical diagnoses and, perhaps someday, serve as a therapist. It can write poetry, dialogue and stories with a surprising degree of sophistication, and it is generally good at common sense — a typical failing for many automated response systems. You can even ask it questions about God.\n\nImagine a Siri-like voice-activated assistant that actually did your intended bidding. It also has the potential to outperform Google for many search queries, which could give rise to a highly profitable company.\n\nGPT-3 does not try to pass the Turing test by being indistinguishable from a human in its responses. Rather, it is built for generality and depth, even though that means it will serve up bad answers to many queries, at least in its current state. As a general philosophical principle, it accepts that being weird sometimes is a necessary part of being smart. In any case, like so many other technologies, GPT-3 has the potential to rapidly improve.\n\nThere is much more at the link.\n\nThe post The case for GPT-3 appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

It’s also the recipe I make most frequently at home, especially now that there’s a toddler who both loves pizza and loves cooking in the house. Indeed, it’s so popular with her that it inspired me to write a children’s book called Every Night is Pizza Night (that book will be out this September, and if you preorder it, or any of my other books, from my Bookshop.org shop, 10% of proceeds go to independent bookstores across the country, and 100% of my sales commission will go towards producing and serving coronavirus relief meals).\n\nYou can read all about the science and process of making pan pizza here, and you'll also find a video on that page that distills the process in about 10 minutes. This video, on the other hand, is almost 30 minutes long, which seems pretty long for a cooking video, but it contains every single active step you need to make this recipe from start to finish, including making a few mistakes along the way.* (You can find a slightly longer original on my YouTube channel.) That means if you gather your ingredients and tools, you can start the video and cook right along with me. It'll be like I'm standing right there in your kitchen, only less creepy. And the best part? You don't even have to share the pizza with me when it's done (but please do share with toddlers and other loved ones).\n\n*I actually went back and checked the active time estimates I gave for both the New York pizza sauce recipes and guess what? They add up to 30 minutes, so I'd say my estimates were spot-on.\n\nAll products linked here have been independently selected by our editors.

Ancient Egyptians used this writing system more than 4000 years ago to record their stories, but only a select group knew how to read and write them. \n\nBut today, thanks to the new Google Arts & Culture tool Fabricius, anyone can interactively discover this fascinating language by means of three dedicated gateways: First, you can “Learn” about the language of ancient Egypt by following a short educational introduction in six easy steps. Secondly, Fabricius invites you to “Play” and translate your own words and messages into hieroglyphics ready to be shared with your friends and family.\n\nPlay_Send a message.gif\n\nAn easy way to write your own messages in Egyptian hieroglyphics to share with your friends (Not academically correct, just for fun!).\n\nWork_Autoclassify.gif\n\nA desktop-only set of tools using Cloud ML to support experts in their workflow of deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nLearn_Gif_stage.gif\n\nSix interactive steps to introduce you to Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nAnd while Fabricius is your doorway to learn about and write in hieroglyphs, it thirdly offers new avenues for academic research, too. So far, experts had to dig manually through books upon books to translate and decipher the ancient language--a process that has remained virtually unchanged for over a century. Fabricius includes the first digital tool - that is also being released as open source to support further developments in the study of ancient languages - that decodes Egyptian hieroglyphs built on machine learning. Specifically, Google Cloud's AutoMLtechnology, AutoML Vision, was used to create a machine learning model that is able to make sense of what a hieroglyph is. In the past you would need a team of Data Scientists, a lot of code, and plenty of time, now AutoML Vision allows developers to easily train a machine to recognize all kinds of objects.\n\nKing Tut from LIFE collection.jpg\n\nThe famous King Tutankhamun discovered in the early 20th century by Howard Carter.\n\nImage of hieroglyphs from British Museum collection.jpg\n\nColorful hieroglyphs found on the decorated coffin of Djedhoriufankh from 1000-900 BC on display at the British Museum.\n\nRosetta Stone from British Museem collection.jpg\n\nThe Rosetta Stone is an important key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs because the same inscription is written in three languages: hieroglyphs, Egyptian demotic script, and Greek.\n\nAvailable in English and Arabic, Fabricius is named after the father of epigraphy, the study of ancient inscriptions. We created it in collaboration with the Australian Center for Egyptology at Macquarie University, Psycle Interactive, Ubisoft and Egyptologists from around the globe. \n\nYou can also explore more stories about the wonders of ancient Egypt, including the famous King Tutankhamun, the Pyramids of Giza and the Book of the Dead.

          "description": "Image: Niantic Labs\n\nPokémon Go creator Niantic Labs is partnering with Punchdrunk, the New York City-based production company behind seminal immersive theater piece Sleep No More. The partnership will see both companies work toward “developing multiple projects that will reinvent storytelling for a 21st century audience and further expand the horizon of interactive entertainment.”\n\nSleep No More, launched in 2011, is an immersive theater production that lets audiences walk through a series of rooms and experience various storylines and other elements of the production at their own pace. Influenced in part by haunted houses and other nonlinear live productions, immersive theater sounds like a prime fit for augmented reality because it could allow for Niantic and companies like Punchdrunk to create fantastical virtual worlds that are then overlaid over real spaces.\n\nImmersive theater seems like a prime fit for augmented reality\n\n“It is hugely exciting to be joining forces with the preeminent AR company in the world. At Punchdrunk we create richly cinematic 3D worlds where audiences can explore, touch and smell the environment; where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are indistinguishable,” Felix Barrett, Punchdrunk’s artistic director, said in a statement. “Those that have seen Sleep No More often liken the experience to how it might feel to walk into a video game. What happens if you take that sense of adventure into the real world? Tear down the walls and the world becomes your stage. “\n\nNiantic offered a few more updates to its current production pipeline, too. The company is still currently working on the mobile AR adaptation of popular board game Catan called Catan: World Explorers. The game is being built on top of Niantic’s Real World Platform in partnership with the company behind the board game and French game publisher Asmodee. Niantic now says the game will enter a beta phase “very soon.”\n\nNiantic also says it’s building “new forms of gaming” for both smartphones and AR glasses, although the company did not elaborate on exactly what headsets from which companies it may be building for. “Currently, we have more than 10 new games in development including prototypes for AR wearables, each with unique and innovative gameplay, centered around outdoor exploration, movement and social interaction,” the company says.\n\nIn December 2019, Qualcomm announced it was working with Niantic on a smart glasses reference design as part of the chipmaker’s Snapdragon XR2 platform. And back in 2017, when support for Apple’s ARKit was first added to Pokémon Go, Niantic strongly hinted it was working with Apple on experiences that could arrive for the iPhone maker’s not-yet-announced but strongly rumored AR glasses.\n",

          "description": "Lanee Jackson of Black Lives Matter DC participates in an “Essential, Not Expendable” demonstration in Washington, DC, on April 27. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBlack Americans have lost 45,777 years of life before age 65 due to Covid-19. White Americans have lost 33,446 years.\n\nMore than 120,000 people in the United States have died of Covid-19.\n\nIt’s an enormous number and, quite frankly, a failure of our national response, and of our leadership. But that number does not seem to be enough to inspire more politicians in states to action, to inspire all Americans to wear masks, to inspire self-sacrifice to save lives.\n\nAnd so we are at a dangerous time in the pandemic. Cases are rising in many states, along with hospitalizations. Deaths have not started rising nationally yet, but researchers fear they’re coming: It can take, on average, 17.8 days from the start of symptoms to a Covid-19 death. America needs a wake-up call to this endless disaster, and fast.\n\nThe death count is almost certainly an undercount. It doesn’t even begin to tell the whole story. Recently, Harvard epidemiologists calculated a Covid-19 statistic that lands like a gut punch. The statistic is “years of potential life lost.” And perhaps it can help shake our collective numbness to the pandemic.\n\nPsychology teaches us it’s too easy to grow numb to mass suffering and death. We need to fight against that instinct when we can. A life lost isn’t just a single number; it’s a trauma with a ripple effect, throughout our communities, and throughout time.\n\nImagining more than 138,000 years of human life lost\n\nCalculating years of potential life lost is somewhat straightforward. The Harvard team looked at death certificate data from people who died of Covid-19 and set a cutoff age, in this case 65.\n\nThey then found all the people who died of documented Covid-19 before reaching this age, and summed up how many years they had left until age 65. This analysis made 65 the cutoff age to try to give a sense of the burden of younger people dying of Covid-19 (though they aren’t dying in rates as high as older people, their loss is still immense). “There’s an arbitrariness,” to the cutoff, Nancy Krieger, a Harvard epidemiologist who co-authored the analysis, says. “But 65 is not arbitrary from a policy standpoint, in terms of benefits, in terms of Social Security, in terms of Medicare. It’s an age that helps also distinguish between people who are of working age still versus not.”\n\nBlack Americans under the age of 65 have lost, collectively, 45,777 years of life, the researchers’ analysis (published in a working paper) found. Hispanics and Latinos lost 48,204.\n\nWhite Americans under age 65 have lost, collectively, 33,446 years of life. Already you can see a clear disparity. White people in the United States greatly outnumber Black people and Hispanics — there are also more deaths among white people overall — but the burden of years life lost among this young group is in these minority communities. (American Indians and Alaska natives lost 1,745 years of life. Asian and Pacific Islanders lost 8,905.)\n\nTallied up, that totals more than 138,000 years of human life lost before age 65. That’s enormous — and still an undercount. Many of these people would have lived to a much older age. Still, this small slice of our national loss is enormous: What is 138,000 years of human life worth?\n\n“You think about people being the dynamic beings that we are, living across space and time,” Krieger says. “And then you have lives that are just pulled out of the picture.”\n\nThat’s a huge loss.\n\n“Think of all people do in a year,” Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public health expert, tweeted on Twitter, referencing Krieger’s study. “You work, have babies, get married, make memories. Black and Latinx populations have lost those opportunities more than 45,000 times from COVID alone.”\n\nThink of all people do in a year. You work, have babies, get married, make memories.\n\nBlack and Latinx populations have lost those opportunities more than 45,000 times from COVID alone.\n\nThis racial health inequity has cost Black and Latinx folks an enormous amount.\n\n— Rhea Boyd MD, MPH (@RheaBoydMD) June 16, 2020\n\nAmerica may be growing numb to the pandemic — but it’s never been more critical to act\n\nThere’s a growing sense that America is giving up on the pandemic. Many states have lifted stay-at-home orders without aggressive new mitigation measures in place. And as cases rise in certain states, it’s unclear if governments will take further action to stop the exponential growth.\n\nAs a reporter covering the pandemic, I feel a greater sense of pandemic doom now than in February. In February, we didn’t know what was going to happen, but we were prepared to do something. Now we have a better idea of what will happen, and we’re largely giving up.\n\nIt’s partly understandable. People are tired of stay-at-home orders. People need to work (especially if the government is unwilling to provide expanded support). There’s also been an absence of a strong, nationalized message on the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a lot of information for individuals navigating the Covid-19 world, but it gets undermined by the Trump administration, which seems to try to make the issue of mask-wearing into more of a front in the culture wars than a guideline for public health.\n\nBut it’s also understandable in terms of human psychology. There’s a concept called psychic numbing, and it may, in part, explain the apathy and exhaustion many are feeling about the coronavirus pandemic. It means that as the number of victims in a tragedy increases, our empathy, our willingness to help, reliably decreases. This happens even when the number of victims increases from one to two.\n\n“Anything that happens on a large scale seems to require that we use numbers to describe it, and yet numbers are precisely the mode of discourse that, in most cases, leaves audiences numb and messages devoid of meaning,” Paul Slovic, the University of Oregon psychologist who has studied psychic numbing for years, writes.\n\n“Years of life lost” could help cut through the numbing\n\nFor me, the “years of life lost” metric helps cut through the numbing by making these deaths a little less abstract. Think about one year of your life: of the depth and richness of it, of what you can accomplish in it, of how many people you can show your love to during it. Now try to multiply that by 138,000.\n\nThis also runs the risk of becoming another large number. But perhaps its novelty, and its accessibility in terms of applying it to our own lives (we can all imagine a year of life), can help. It also underscores how a single death is a trauma that can ripple out.\n\n“When someone dies, their own death matters enormously,” Krieger says. “But it matters enormously for everyone in that person’s family, friends, and networks. When you strip out someone at a much younger age, there’s just a different dimension to what that burden is.”\n\nNo death occurs in a vacuum. “It’s also all the ripple effects,” Krieger says. The parents who can no longer provide for their kids. The people who can no longer contribute to their communities. “This gives a different view, and I think it’s a very important one about who is being ripped out of society at younger ages.”\n\nA life lost isn’t just a single number — it’s a trauma with a ripple effect, throughout our communities, and throughout time\n\nEven among older people, years of life — years of potential — are being lost. In Italy, researchers found that Covid-19 was killing people around 12 to 14 years before they might have died naturally. Even accounting for age and underlying conditions, the study found, people were dying more than five years sooner than life span estimates would suggest.\n\nOf course, death isn’t the only effect Covid-19 has had on our society. There are plenty of other reasons we need greater action to manage the pandemic. One is the great health burden — all the hospitalizations, the days sick, the lingering effects — on those who fall ill but recover. Also the unknowns: Even asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 may leave a mark on the lungs.\n\nAnother reason is to save our economy. Another is for our mental health. Nationally, around a third of Americans have reported symptoms of anxiety and depression since late April. For comparison, in the first three months of 2019, just 11 percent of Americans reported these symptoms on a similar survey.\n\nDeath “is really important,” Krieger says. “But there’s also when somebody gets sick, or they’re worried about being sick, there’s all the fear that goes with that. There’s the concerns of their loved ones about them. There’s the questions of what the economic implications are for individuals and their households if someone becomes ill.”\n\nThere’s also the unfair burden Covid-19 is placing on Black and minority communities — in terms of health and mortality, but economically too. In the paper, Krieger and her co-authors find Covid-19 mortality is nine times higher in Black communities compared to white people in the 35- to 44-year-old range. “You don’t get relative risks for seven- to ninefold for most things in the US for health inequities,” Krieger says. This is extreme.\n\nAnd a lot more damage can still be done. For the pandemic to simmer down naturally — in a way that will allow life to go back to normal — the population needs to achieve something called herd immunity. For the coronavirus, herd immunity could possibly be achieved when 50 percent of the population is immune. But it could need to be as high as 65 percent.\n\nNo area is anywhere near that figure, even New York City, where at least 17,000 people have died of Covid-19. In late April, it was estimated that 20 percent of the city had been exposed to the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the infection rates are much, much lower.\n\nThere are so many reasons to not be numb to the coronavirus pandemic. As we see case counts rising, we can’t stay complacent. There’s so much more left to lose.\n\nSupport Vox’s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

          "description": "[Photographs: Vicky Wasik, Shao Z.]\n\nIf you’re familiar with Korean cuisine, then you’ve probably come across gochujang, a spicy-sweet chili paste that’s as versatile as it is delicious. The pungent paste is made from red chili pepper flakes, fermented soy beans, glutinous rice, and salt. It’s traditionally fermented for many months, and sometimes years, in which the starches from the rice are converted to sugars, helping create gochujang’s iconic yet subtle sweetness.\n\nBecause it's not just cooked, but fermented, Gochujang does much more than add spice to your favorite dishes. We love its complex layers of flavor that make it spicy, sweet, salty, and funky all at once. It also has a thick consistency and deep red color that adds texture and brightness when used, especially in sauces and marinades. You’ll often find gochujang in Korean dishes like bibimbap and bulgogi, as well as a number of stews and sauces.\n\nA little goes a long way with this umami-boosting ingredient. In the recipes below, only about a tablespoon or two of gochujang is called for, but you can always add more to suit your tastes. From barbecue sauces and ketchups to stir-fried anchovy banchan and crispy skillet rice, these are our favorite ways to incorporate the sweet heat of gochujang.\n\n[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]\n\nGochujang is the backbone of this Korean barbecue sauce. The paste is mixed with the savory flavors of doenjang (fermented Korean soybean paste), along with garlic, scallions, and toasted sesame oil and seeds. The result is a condiment with layers of complex flavor. The best way to enjoy ssamjang is by spreading it on lettuce before piling on grilled meat, seafood, and vegetables.\n\nSsamjang (Korean Barbecue Dipping Sauce) Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Video: Serious Eats Team]\n\nWith pickle-brined fried chicken being as popular as it is, we decided to use the same technique with a different kind of pickle: kimchi. The kimchi brine gives the chicken flavor and helps it stay juicy, while also lending some texture to the dry dredging mixture. After frying the chicken until it's crispy and golden brown, it gets slathered with a gochujang-based sauce that incorporates more heat from gochugaru and more sweetness from honey. We can’t think of a better way to serve this than on Stella’s flaky black sesame buttermilk biscuits.\n\nKimchi-Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Emily and Matt Clifton]\n\nThese burgers get much of their flavor from what’s on the outside, not the inside. While grilling, they’re brushed with flavorful bulgogi sauce that includes soy sauce, brown sugar, and gochujang. They get another coating of the sauce after grilling, and then are loaded with spicy kimchi mayo and pickled daikon radish before being sandwiched between toasted sesame buns.\n\nGrilled Korean Bulgogi Burgers With Kimchi Mayo and Pickled Daikon Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Shao Z.]\n\nGochujang works best in sauces and marinades that get slathered over meats, like these grilled pork belly kebabs. We mix it with soy sauce and sake to round out the flavor and add complexity. You’ll want to toss the pork with the marinade and let it sit for about an hour before skewering. While the kebabs cook on the grill, baste them with extra marinade every few minutes until the pork is tender on the inside and browned on the outside.\n\nGrilled Pork Belly Kebabs With Sweet-and-Spicy Gochujang Marinade Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Daniel Gritzer]\n\nA sauce that combines the funky Korean flavors of kimchi and gochujang with the sweet tang of a barbecue sauce? Say no more. We use a blender to create a puree out of the kimchi and its juices, along with onion, garlic, and ginger. Then, we move to the stove and combine this mixture with ketchup, rice vinegar, gochujang, Worcestershire sauce, and molasses, cooking until the sauce has thickened and all the flavors have combined. The result is a flavorful sauce that pairs well with grilled chicken, pork, and shellfish like shrimp.\n\nKorean Kimchi Barbecue Sauce Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Joshua Bousel]\n\nA simple whisking of a few ingredients gives you this sweet and spicy Korean ketchup in no time. The mixture gets a kick from the gochujang, while brown sugar helps balance out the flavor and add a bit more sweetness. In addition, the ketchup gets its depth of flavor from soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Once you get a taste of this, you might never go back to plain ketchup again.\n\nSweet and Spicy Korean Ketchup Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Yvonne Ruperti]\n\nThough kimchi is often served as a compliment to most dishes, sometimes that’s just not enough. We went ahead and made it the star of the show in this stir-fry. It's sautéed with julienne-like strips of chicken so that the meat cooks quickly and absorbs all of the flavors. A handful of cabbage is added in to offset the strong flavors of the kimchi. To finish it off, stir in some gochujang and fish sauce, then serve over rice.\n\nKimchi Chicken and Cabbage Stir-Fry Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]\n\nThe crisp crunch of Korean fried chicken combined with this sweet and spicy sauce is a match made in fried chicken heaven. Here, gochujang is whisked together with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Since the thickness of gochujang can be inconsistent, you may need to add up to two tablespoons of water until the sauce is thin enough to spread easily, yet thick enough to cling to the crispy outer layer of the chicken.\n\nSweet and Spicy Chili Sauce For Korean Fried Chicken Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]\n\nForget Buffalo wings—fire chicken is the ultimate game-day treat. To make the Korean bar food, start off by marinating chicken thighs in a spicy gochujang-spiked sauce. In addition to the gochujang, this sauce gets an added layer of depth from gochugaru (Korean chili powder), red chili peppers, and black pepper, along with a surprise addition of Sprite. In order to keep the chicken from drying out, we grill the thighs whole before cutting them into bite-size pieces. Finally, the chicken is covered in mozzarella cheese and broiled until bubbling. Game day or not, this is one delicious treat that’ll be gone in no time.\n\nKorean-Style Fire Chicken (Buldak) With Cheese Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Aki Kamozawa and H. Alexander Talbot]\n\nThis flavored butter is perfect for sautéeing fish or dunking clams, but we won’t tell if you take a bite of it all on its own. Sesame seeds are toasted in the butter first, and then get mixed with a nice splash of bourbon. The mixture is finished off with the teriyaki-flavored nori sheets and gochujang, both of which add an extra layer of sweetness. The ghee keeps in the fridge for about two weeks, but you’re likely to use it up much sooner than that.\n\nGochujang-Infused Ghee With Toasted Sesame Seeds and Bourbon Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]\n\nThe ideal midday snack should be sweet, savory, crunchy, and irresistible all at once, just like this stir-fried anchovy banchan. Baby anchovies are coated in a glaze made up of gochugaru, soy sauce, fish sauce, and gochujang. The recipe comes together in minutes, and keeps well in the fridge.

Kenji Lopez-Alt]\n\nGochujang can do more than serve as a base for sauces and marinades. Here, it finds its way into instant noodles by adding flavor to both the short ribs and the broth. If more spiciness is desired, you can always add more gochujang, especially after dividing the soup into individual bowls. We suggest topping your bowl off with mushrooms, scallions, kimchi, and a soft-boiled egg.\n\nHomemade Shin Cup-Style Spicy Korean Ramyun Beef Noodle Soup Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]\n\nFried rice isn’t the only answer to your leftover rice problem. Loaded with an array of flavors and textures, there’s no question that this cheese- and kimchi-topped skillet rice should be added to your rotation. The rice gets mixed thoroughly with gochujang, soy sauce, and rice vinegar before moving to the skillet. Both mozzarella and Gruyère find their way into the dish in between layers of the rice, which is then cooked and broiled in the oven. Adding kimchi and cotija within the last two minutes of broiling helps the skillet rice char nicely. Before serving, you can finish the dish off with a generous amount of sliced scallions for an added crunch.\n\nCrispy Cheese- and Kimchi-Topped Skillet Rice Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg]\n\nThis Korean spin on quesadillas brings together flaky Chinese-style scallion pancakes with bulgogi-style steak and two types of cheese. Gochujang makes its way into the marinade, along with ingredients like soy sauce and brown sugar. After preparing both the meat and the scallion pancakes, the rest is all about assembly. Top two scallion pancakes with bulgogi meat, as well as shredded cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses, then close it off with the remaining pancakes. Once the cheese is melted and the pancakes are browned, you can drizzle the quesadillas with additional gochujang and top with scallions and cilantro.\n\nBulgogi Scallion Pancake-adillas Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Daniel Gritzer]\n\nThis easy stir-fry is perfect for a weeknight dinner. Strips of pork shoulder are marinated in a mixture that gets its subtle sweetness from gochujang and Asian pear, an ingredient that also helps tenderize the meat. After sitting in the marinade for at least two hours (but up to eight for maximum flavor), all that’s left to do is cook the meat with onions, green chili pepper, scallions, and kimchi. Serve with lettuce leaves and rice for a secretly easy, but supremely flavorful dinner.\n\nKorean Spicy Marinated Pork With Chilies and Kimchi (Jaeyook Kimchi Bokum) Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\n[Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg]\n\nOne of the best things about nachos is that its flavors are so easy to change up. Our Korean take on the dish includes bulgogi-style steak, caramelized kimchi, and lime sour cream. Gochujang makes its way into our homemade cheese sauce, which gets drizzled on top of fried wonton chips and the other toppings. The result is a beautifully messy and flavorful plate of nachos unlike any you’ve had before.\n\nKorean Nachos Recipe »\n\nBack to the full list\n\nAll products linked here have been independently selected by our editors.

          "description": "When it comes to hotel chains, we can all agree on one thing: Hyatt does all-inclusive right. Whether it’s the family-friendly Ziva properties, adult-only Zilara or high-end Miraval resorts, Hyatt takes the all-inclusive experience up a notch with great food and on-site entertainment options. Recently, Hyatt has added another great property to its all-inclusive portfolio: The Alila Ventana Big Sur, reports One Mile at a Time.\n\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nBixby Bridge, Big Sur. (Photo by Dave Lastovskiy via Unsplash)\n\nThis hotel has been part of the World of Hyatt program since 2019 and bookable for 30,000 points per night. The property has been closed since March due to the COVID-19 crisis but is set to reopen on July 15, 2020. When it does, the nightly rate (including award redemptions) will include meals, snacks, select activities and chauffeur service within a three-mile radius. Here’s a complete list of what’s included:\n\nDining in-room (all meals), poolside (lunch), or at The Sur House (breakfast and dinner) — which has a new seating plan and is reserved exclusively for resort guests.\n\nSnacks to take on outings, along with complimentary reusable water bottles.\n\nAccess to the resort’s Signature Experiences such as yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, and daily hikes.\n\nThe Ventana Big Sur picnic program.\n\nAccess to indoor and outdoor fitness studios.\n\nChauffeur service within a three-mile radius.\n\nAccess to private, reservation-only indoor and outdoor wellness studios.\n\nThe Excursion Outpost, which offers complimentary items for use on picnics, hikes, etc.\n\nNew outdoor lounging across the grounds.\n\nThis is a pretty generous list of offerings, especially considering how expensive staying at this property can be. Room rates regularly go for over $1,000 per night, while the award redemption rate is 30,000 points per night. Not having to worry about paying for meals and activities beyond that is even more of an incentive to stay at this resort.\n\nRelated: 11 all-inclusive beach resorts you can book with points\n\nEarning enough Hyatt points for a free night\n\nVentana Big Sur’s Vista Hot Tub Suite. (Photo courtesy Alila Hotels)\n\nIf a stay at the Alila Ventana Big Sur sounds like a perfect post-pandemic retreat, you’ll be glad to know you don’t need to shell out thousands of dollars for the privilege. This property is a terrific use of 30,000 Hyatt points, which aren’t too difficult to come by.\n\nYou can transfer points at a 1:1 ratio from a card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which currently offers a 60,000-point sign-up bonus after $4,000 spent in three months. The World of Hyatt Visa is another great alternative if you want a card with Hyatt-specific perks like elite status.\n\nThe card comes with 25,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 in three months. Plus another 25,000 points after $6,000 in total spending within six months. The card comes with Discoverist status, which gets you perks like 10% bonus points, M life Pearl status, free premium internet, space-available room upgrades, 2 p.m. checkout and more.\n\nIf you want to earn high status, you’ll also get five qualifying nights toward elite status plus two credits for every $5,000 spent on the card. Through June 30, this number is elevated to three credits for every $5,000 spent.\n\nPlus, you’ll earn 4x points at Hyatt hotels and 2x points on restaurants, direct airline ticket purchases, local transit and fitness club/gym memberships. The card’s $95 annual fee can be easily offset with the annual free night certificate, valid at any Category 1-4 Hyatt hotel. You’ll get an additional certificate for charging $15,000 on the card every cardmember anniversary.\n\nRelated: Hyatt offering 10,000 points for expiring free night certificates\n\nBottom line\n\nOne of the best ways to get value out of Hyatt points is to use them at high-end properties like the Ventana. However, high-end redemptions often come with high ticket prices for on-site amenities and meals. The Ventana Big Sur’s new status as an all-inclusive property helps solve this conundrum. I for one look forward to making the 1.5-hour drive up to Big Sur, once it’s safe to do so, to check out the new offerings for myself.\n\nFeatured photo by Dave Lastovskiy via Unsplash.\n",

          "description": "Yesterday, Greg covered the news about the Etihad and Aeroplan partnership. In that post, Greg noted some of the potentially interesting opportunities with Aeroplan miles. One of the exciting things about this partnership is the ability to mix and match flights with Star Alliance carriers in order to piece together a cool trip. This post offers a look at the various Aeroplan sweet spots starting from the United States followed by how to use the Aeroplan engine to connect the dots on the sweetest spot regarding this partnership, which could put you on Etihad apartments to Australia for a very reasonable price — perhaps even getting 20 hours of Etihad apartments for the business class price.\n\nAeroplan sweet spots from the United States\n\nWe have previously written a series of “Best ways to get to” various regions of the world in premium cabins (see this page for a full list of those posts so far). To recap Aeroplan-specific sweet spots, see the North America-centric award chart and snippets below:\n\nAsia\n\nThe short story: Aeroplan offers decent pricing for awards to and from Asia, with a decent number of partners on which you’ll pay no or low fuel surcharges. They also offer stopovers on round trip awards, which can present particular value. Lap infants are charged incredibly reasonable fees in either cash or miles and the price is the same whether booking one way or round trip.\n\nMiles required: 75K miles each way in business class to Asia 1 or the Indian Subcontinent or 77.5K miles each way to Asia 2 (roughly “Southeast Asia”). First class is 105K or 107.5K each way. Fuel surcharges are passed on with some partners, so choose carriers with low / no fuel surcharges.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Aeroplan.com (you’ll need to create a free Aeroplan frequent flyer account to search)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Aeroplan.com. Can also book via phone. Lap infants must be added to your reservation over the phone.\n\nKey warnings: There are high fuel surcharges on Lufthansa.\n\nNo fuel surcharges on: Aegean, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Avianca, Brussels Airlines, COPA, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Ethiopian, Etihad, EVA Airlines, GOL, Juneao Airlines, SAS, SWISS, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines\n\nLow fuel surcharges on: Cathay Pacific / Cathay Dragon, LOT Polish, Thai Airways\n\nTransfer from: Amex, Capital One, Marriott\n\nAfrica\n\nThe short story: Aeroplan offers better pricing on Star Alliance business class awards to Africa than United does, though they definitely aren’t the cheapest way to fly business class to Africa. They also offer stopovers on round trip awards, which can present particular value. Lap infants are charged incredibly reasonable fees in either cash or miles and the price is the same whether booking one way or round trip.\n\nMiles required: 75K miles each way in business class or 105K in first class to East, West, and South Africa or 82.5K each way in business class / 115K in first class to North Africa (and the Middle East). Fuel surcharges are passed on, so choose carriers with low / no fuel surcharges.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Aeroplan.com (you’ll need to create a free Aeroplan frequent flyer account to search)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Aeroplan.com. Can also book via phone. Lap infants must be added to your reservation over the phone.\n\nKey warnings: There are high fuel surcharges on Lufthansa, but the relative savings in terms of miles used for first class might mitigate the fees.\n\nNo fuel surcharges on: Aegean, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Avianca, Brussels Airlines, COPA, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Ethiopian, Etihad, EVA Airlines, GOL, Juneao Airlines, SAS, SWISS, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines\n\nLow fuel surcharges on: Cathay Pacific / Cathay Dragon, LOT Polish, Thai Airways\n\nTransfer from: Amex, Marriott\n\nEurope\n\nThe short story: Aeroplan offers competitive pricing on Star Alliance business class awards and the best deal on first class awards to and from Europe at 70K each way. They also offer stopovers on round trip awards, which can present particular value. Lap infants are charged incredibly reasonable fees in either cash or miles and the price is the same whether booking one way or round trip.\n\nMiles required: 55K each way in business class or 70K each way in first class. Fuel surcharges are passed on, so choose carriers with low / no fuel surcharges.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Aeroplan.com (you’ll need to create a free Aeroplan frequent flyer account to search)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Aeroplan.com. Can also book via phone. Lap infants must be added to your reservation over the phone.\n\nKey warnings: There are high fuel surcharges on Lufthansa, but the relative savings in terms of miles used for first class might mitigate the fees.\n\nNo fuel surcharges on: Aegean, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Avianca, Brussels Airlines, COPA, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Ethiopian, Etihad, EVA Airlines, GOL, Juneao Airlines, SAS, SWISS, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines\n\nLow fuel surcharges on: Cathay Pacific / Cathay Dragon, LOT Polish, Thai Airways\n\nTransfer from: Amex, Capital One, Marriott\n\nAustralia / New Zealand / Oceania\n\nThe short story: While priced a bit higher than ANA, Aeroplan offers three advantages: They allow one-way redemptions; they offer stopovers on round trip awards (which has “temporarily” changed as of 9/1/19, but a single stopover or open jaw is still allowed); Lap infants are charged incredibly reasonable fees in either cash or miles and the price is the same whether booking one way or round trip.\n\nMiles required: 80K each way in business class / 110K each way in first class. Fuel surcharges are passed on, so choose carriers with low / no fuel surcharges.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Aeroplan.com (you’ll need to create a free Aeroplan frequent flyer account to search)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Aeroplan.com. Can also book via phone. Lap infants must be added to your reservation over the phone.\n\nKey warnings: Fuel surcharges would ordinarily be the warning with Aeroplan, but I think that any carrier you might fly to this region has no / low fuel surcharges. The other key warning is to be sure to search for availability at Aeroplan.com and/or call before transferring miles. Aeroplan has an unpublished maximum permitted mileage (MPM) between any city pair, so be sure your routing is valid for Aeroplan (United shows some itineraries that are not possible with Aeroplan).\n\nNo fuel surcharges on: Aegean, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Avianca, Brussels Airlines, COPA, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Ethiopian, Etihad, EVA Airlines, GOL, Juneao Airlines, SAS, SWISS, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines\n\nLow fuel surcharges on: Cathay Pacific / Cathay Dragon, LOT Polish, Thai Airways\n\nIndian subcontinent?\n\nWhile we do not have a post specific to the Indian subcontinent, Aeroplan also offers potentially attractive pricing to this region if you’re looking to fly Etihad at 75K each way in business class or 105K each way in first class.\n\nThe real sweet spot: Australia & how to do it with multi-city\n\nWhile Greg floated the idea of flying to Europe in first class via Abu Dhabi for 70K one-way, I don’t think that will price out as he hoped based on my initial searches and my rough understanding of Aeroplan’s Maximum Permitted Mileage rules. Last year, I couldn’t book a flight from Crete to Brussels to Milan because it was about 100 miles beyond the max permitted mileage between Crete and Milan (whereas flying Crete to Frankfurt to Milan was acceptable for Aeroplan). I think Abu Dhabi is likely to be too far out of the way to be a valid connection point for Europe (and indeed, based on my initial searches, a multi-city trip that goes through Abu Dhabi prices like a US-to-Middle East award).\n\nHowever, Australia is really far away, so max permitted mileage doesn’t cause an issue with itineraries to Australia.\n\nIf you can find availability from the US to Abu Dhabi to Sydney, it would indeed be possible to book that entire trip in Etihad First Class apartments for 110K miles each way. That’s pretty spectacular.\n\nThe trouble is two-fold: First, finding Etihad first class award space leaving the US can be challenging. Second, the online Aeroplan booking tool won’t price a one-way from US cities to Australia via Abu Dhabi. Air Canada and the several Asian Star Alliance carriers offer so much availability that I couldn’t find a date that would price a simple one-way from the US to Abu Dhabi to Sydney on Etihad (and I additionally didn’t find any first class space on Etihad from the US to Abu Dhabi — it may exist, I just gave up on it in order to cut to the chase and prove whether the pricing were possible).\n\nHowever, with the multi-city tool, one can indeed prove the pricing theory (110K each way in first class — or maybe less) holds up. More on that in a minute.\n\nBreaking away on a tangent for a moment, it’s worth noting that one of the sweetest spots on the Aeroplan chart is Europe 1 or 2 to the Middle East at 60K or 55K miles one-way in first class. Etihad offers A380 apartments first class between London or Paris and Abu Dhabi (at least in normal times — your guess is as good as mine as to what the schedule will look like when travel picks back up). That’s a great sweet spot on its own if you are visiting Europe and want to tack on a trip to the UAE (or other parts of that Middle East region).\n\nHowever, this also means that if you can find availability from the US to Paris or London, you can connect to A380 apartments first class from those cities to Abu Dhabi — and award space on flights from London or Paris to Abu Dhabi isn’t terribly difficult to find.\n\nThankfully, United award space to London or Paris isn’t terribly hard to find at the moment either. We reported that fact a couple of weeks ago and there is still quite a bit of availability toward the end of the schedule (spring 2021).\n\nAeroplan prices a mixed-cabin award at the price of the highest cabin included. Therefore, if we were to book Washington, DC to Paris in United business class and then Paris to Abu Dhabi in Etihad first class, that prices at 115K miles one-way (the price of a first-class award from North America to the Middle East / Northern Africa).\n\nHowever, if you add a 14 hour first class apartments flight to Sydney to that, it would price five thousand miles less at just 110K one-way.\n\nUnfortunately, as noted above, the online tool won’t price that. However, if you use the multi-city tool, you indeed can price it out as a complicated round trip. The screen shot is coming. I assume that you’ll also be able to get an agent to price it one-way (rather than the round trip that I will show in this post) if that’s what you want (YMMV).\n\nThe difficult thing about Aeroplan’s multi-city tool is that it will only let you input three city pairs:\n\nIf you click the “How to build multi-city trips” link within that tool, it basically uses graphics and more words than necessary to tell you that the multi-city tool can only be used to price a round trip with either 1 stopover or 1 open jaw. That means you can’t book a one-way ticket using the multi-city tool (sometimes an airline’s multi-city tool can be used to force the one-way routing you want; no dice with that here). Further, if you have a stopover, you have to return to the city of origin (you get either a stopover or an open jaw, not both).\n\nAgain, since Aeroplan (sort of) prices the itinerary at the price of the highest class of service included each way, I only needed one leg in first class each way to prove that a round tip to Australia prices at 220K in first class, even with Etihad included. Rather than spend all night trying to thread the needle with Etihad first class availability both ways (and because that would likely be impossible to do given I can only enter 3 city pairs), I entered my search as follows:\n\nWashington (IAD) to Paris (CDG)\n\nParis (CDG) to Sydney, Australia (SYD)\n\nSydney, Australia (SYD) to Washington, DC (IAD)\n\nNote that the dates on the trip below aren’t particularly realistic, but they are an example to show that with Aeroplan and for 220K miles, you could fly business class to Paris and stopover for a couple of days, then fly 20 hours in Etihad A380 first class apartments to Sydney (your destination for as long as you want), and then return by flying from Sydney to Tokyo in business class on ANA and then ANA first class from Tokyo to Washington DC (13 hours in what could be their new first class) for a total of 220K and about $261 USD.\n\nAlternatively, if you’re OK with all ANA business class on the way home, you could chop 60K miles off the top and still get 20 hours of Etihad first class. Personally, I’d pay the extra 60K to fly Tokyo to Washington in first class, but you do you. Truth be told, given that Aeroplan’s business class price is 160K miles round trip to Australia, building in 20K hours of Etihad first class at the business class price could certainly be viewed as a win. Again, that’s a net cost of 80K each way with 20 hours in first class that you see below.\n\nThe difficulties\n\nThe hardest thing at play here will be finding availability between the US and Abu Dhabi without having to connect in Europe. If you’re willing to connect in Europe, this shouldn’t be much of an issue.\n\nThe second toughest piece is that I had some challenge finding itineraries where Etihad was the only carrier. I found it much easier to find Etihad availability with the Aeroplan tool when I had at least one Star Alliance carrier in the mix. There were some routes where I’d expect availability but the system seemed to be blocking me without a Star Alliance leg (though note that I did find Paris to Sydney all in Etihad first class, so YMMV). I also saw comments elsewhere indicating that Aeroplan agents were unable to see some availability you might expect if you’re familiar with the tricks to find space on the New York-to-Abu-Dhabi flight — though I also saw a comment or two indicating that Aeroplan agents saw some additional unexpected availability in some instances, so YMMV.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nSome are likely asking, “Is it worth 220K miles to fly round trip to Australia?”.\n\nMy first reaction is, “Heck yeah! Did you see that itinerary above?? Twenty hours of apartments, almost 10 hours of solid ANA business and almost 13 hours of ANA first class for that price? With a stopover in Paris on the way? Definitely.\n\nBut then I realized that it’s worth putting a bit more thought into it from two perspectives.\n\nFirst, Aeroplan is an Amex transfer partner (they also partner with Capital One and Marriott, but most readers would likely be transferring from Amex). If you’re transferring American Express Membership Rewards to Aeroplan, you have to also consider transferring them to ANA Mileage Club for a complicated trip like this. While I think that ANA is still unable to book Etihad awards, ANA has an incredible round-the-world award chart. The itinerary above to Sydney and back comes to 26,200 miles flown. ANA would charge 170K miles to fly that in business class or 260K miles in first class, with up to eight stopovers on the way. You’d be limited to flying Star Alliance carriers in that scenario, so maybe you’d actually cut out Abu Dhabi, maybe you’d be able to shorten it to the next band down – there are a lot of variables. The point is that ANA Mileage Club might be competitive. Still, with so few Star Alliance carriers offering first class, I’d probably only be considering the round-the-world chart for business class and then only if I wanted to make several stops on the way. ANA isn’t a clearly better value here – it’ll depend on your intents.\n\nThe second lens through which to look at it is the same one I pondered the other day when I asked, “Is it now irrational to hold Ultimate Rewards points?“. That post is about Chase points rather than Amex, but it nonetheless points out the cash value of points. Given that Schwab Platinum cardholders can cash out Membership Rewards points at a rate of 1.25c each, that 220K points is worth at least $2,750. So the question becomes: is this trip worth at least that much to you? In my case, it absolutely would be.\n\nIn fact, Greg and I also talked on Frequent Miler on the Air about how the Chase grocery redemption option will give opportunities to potentially cash out Chase points at about 1.5c each and then use the cash to buy other mileage currencies. Air Canada is now allowing customers to convert vouchers to Aeroplan miles. The announced rate was about 1.3c per mile, though we reported the other day that it is currently showing more like 1.54c per mile. Hopefully it gets resolved and is closer to 1.3c, but for easy math let’s say you can convert Air Canada travel vouchers to miles at a rate of 1.5c each. One could theoretically “cash out” Ultimate Rewards points via a grocery store and use the cash to buy Air Canada tickets in order to convert them to Aeroplan miles – effectively trading Chase points for Aeroplan miles at a rate of 1:1. In that case, you’d be forgoing a bit more cash in the pocket yet over the Amex example, but it could make it easier to amass the necessary Aeroplan miles. A trip like this with multiple stops and something like 50 hours of premium cabin travel is a bit more likely to be the type of juice that’s worth the squeeze in terms of using your points for travel rather than groceries.\n\nAll that said, 220K miles is a lot of miles/points, especially if you’re bringing anyone with you. This type of redemption clearly won’t be for everyone. For those with the points or miles to burn though, this could be quite attractive.\n\nBottom line\n\nI’m pretty excited about the new Aeroplan/Etihad partnership as it is always exciting to see new opportunities open up in this game. Further, while I’ve flown Etihad first class before, I have not flown the apartments and I would love to. Add on top of that the fact that Aeroplan has the most reasonable lap infant fees in the game ($100 or 10,000 miles in business class or $125 or 12,500 miles in first class whether one-way or round trip), next year could be the ideal time for me to try out those Etihad apartments if the travel landscape allows. At this point, tempted as I am by these opportunities, I think it is unlikely that I’ll book something yet. But that doesn’t mean I won’t give it a few searches and live vicariously through those who are able to take advantage of the sweet spots while they remain. We still don’t know what the new Aeroplan program will look like (scheduled to be unveiled this year), so it is certainly possible (and perhaps likely) that sweet spots like this will change. so if I were more confident in my 2021 travel outlook, I’d probably think sooner rather than later, though there’s a lot of speculation at play here in terms of which flights will operate, whether travel will be enjoyable/safe, etc. Still, I’m excited about the possibility of redeeming a currency that’s fairly easy to collect for a first class product I’d love to fly.\n\nThe post Aeroplan / Etihad first class sweet spot: US to Australia & how to do it appeared first on Frequent Miler.\n",

          "description": "Etihad is well-known for its posh business and first-class products, but did you know that the airline has a powerful loyalty program too? The airline has partnerships with nearly two-dozen airlines, giving you a ton of options for earning and redeeming Etihad Guest miles during your travels.\n\nSome of these redemptions offer incredible value too, with some of our favorites being cheap transcontinental first-class tickets on American Airlines and low-cost transcontinental business class tickets with Brussels Airlines and Royal Air Maroc.\n\nPlus, the airline has a number of non-airline partnerships that can help you earn Etihad Guest miles quickly. These various partnerships let you earn miles when staying at hotels, renting cars and making everyday purchases with select American Express, Capital One and Citi credit cards.\n\nHere’s a look at Etihad Guest’s most powerful partnerships. We’ll start by looking at earning and redeeming miles with Etihad’s airline partners, then move onto earning with hotel stays, rental cars and credit cards. Let’s dive in!\n\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nEtihad’s airline partners\n\n(Photo by Rebius/Shutterstock)\n\nDespite not being a member of a major airline alliance, Etihad has a broad range of airline partners around the world. These were formed through codeshare agreements and investments, with Etihad owning a portion of airlines like Alitalia and Air Serbia.\n\nAll of Etihad’s partners have a unique earning and redemption chart, with varying rates. For example, American Airlines awards are priced by region, ANA prices by distance flown and Air Serbia prices by city pair.\n\nEtihad doesn’t offer online booking for any of its airline partners, so you’ll have to call Etihad Guest to book these tickets. We highly recommend finding award space before you call. We’ll dive into how to find award space for each partner below.\n\nAir Canada\n\nIn June 2020, Air Canada and Etihad announced a new partnership that allows Etihad members to earn and redeem miles on Air Canada flights, and vice-versa. Air Canada is the largest airline in Canada, serving nearly 200 destinations worldwide. Here’s a look at how you can earn and redeem miles on all of these flights.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Air Canada\n\nEtihad awards up to a 125% bonus on miles flown on Air Canada flights. The earning chart is extensive and has different earning rates intra-Canada and international flights. The international chart includes flights to and from the U.S. as well, so make sure you’re using the right chart to calculate your earnings.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that some Air Canada domestic fares earn 0% miles flown when credited to Etihad. It’s in your best interest to credit intra-Canada flights in the S, T, L, A and K fare classes to programs like Air Canada Aeroplan and United MileagePlus, which do award miles for these fare classes.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Air Canada\n\nEtihad’s Air Canada award chart is distance-based, so you’ll redeem miles based on how far you’re flying. You’ll get the best value when redeeming Etihad miles for short-haul flights on Air Canada.\n\nFor example, you can redeem 5,000 miles for an economy class ticket if the flight is under 500 miles. This includes the 357-mile jaunt from Toronto (YYZ) to New York (LGA) and 324-mile flight from Montreal (YUL) to New York.\n\nBoth of these flights can get expensive when booking at the last minute. I’ve personally paid over $250 for a one-way ticket from New York to Montreal over the holidays. Having this low-cost redemption option is great for those who fly on the route often.\n\nAir New Zealand\n\nAs the flag carrier of New Zealand, Air New Zealand operates routes domestically as well as to Asia, North America, the South Pacific and even Europe. Plus, the airline has a solid business class product and even offers an innovative Skycouch in economy class.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air New Zealand\n\nYou can earn Etihad Guest miles on all Air New Zealand flights. Flights will earn miles based on your booking class, the distance of your flight and the region you’re flying in — you can find an up-to-date earning chart on the Etihad website. Simply multiply the distance of your flight by the percentage listed next to your booking class to see how many miles you’ll earn on your partner flight.\n\nFor example, if you flew Auckland (AKL) to Los Angeles (LAX) in Air New Zealand C fare business class, you’d earn 9,756 Etihad Guest miles as a non-elite member. The math looks like this: 6,504 miles X 1.5 miles = 9,756. If you have status with Etihad Guest, be sure to factor in elite bonuses, which range from 25-75%.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air New Zealand\n\nYou can redeem Etihad Guest miles on all Air New Zealand flights with open award space — the easiest way to find this is to use a Star Alliance search tool. Like all Etihad Guest partner awards, you have to call the airline to actually book your award ticket.\n\nEtihad prices Air New Zealand award tickets by distance. To calculate the cost of your ticket, use a website like Great Circle Mapper to find your flight distance and then match it to the appropriate tier on Etihad’s award chart. In the case of AKL to LAX, you’d need a whopping 210,000 miles to book a one-way ticket in business class.\n\nUnfortunately, this makes Etihad Guest one of the most expensive options when it comes to redeeming miles for Air New Zealand flights. You may want to consider other options like Air Canada Aeroplan or ANA Mileage Club if you’re transferring American Express Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou or Capital One miles for an Air New Zealand flight.\n\nFind Air New Zealand award space with your favorite Star Alliance search engine or on ExpertFlyer.\n\nAir Serbia\n\nEtihad owns 49% of Air Serbia, and its funding has helped the Eastern European carrier launch its first long-haul route: Belgrade (BEG) to New York-JFK. Additionally, Air Serbia uses Etihad Guest as its default loyalty program, so you can earn and redeem Etihad Guest miles on all flights operated by Air Serbia.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Serbia\n\nEtihad Guest has two Air Serbia earning charts: one for short and mid-haul flights and another for its BEG–JFK route. Miles earned are based on class of service and distance flown, so you’ll earn more miles for longer flights. You can view these earnings charts on Etihad’s website.\n\nEtihad Guest’s Air Serbia short- and mid-haul earning chart.\n\nUnfortunately, Economy Light fares — commonly referred to as “White” fares — aren’t eligible to earn Etihad Guest miles. Thankfully, these fares are only sold on intra-Europe flights, so you will earn at least 25% miles flown in all other fare classes.\n\nEtihad Guest’s Air Serbia long-haul earning chart.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Serbia\n\nEtihad Guest prices Air Serbia awards route-by-route, so you’ll need to find your route of choice on the Etihad Guest website and match it to the award’s price. In the case of the BEG – JFK route, you’ll pay 64,082 for a one-way ticket in business class or 44,970 in economy.\n\nMany of Air Serbia’s shorter, intra-Europe routes start at 5,000 miles one-way in economy class, making them a good option if you’re planning a tour around Europe. Just be sure to compare paid fares and make sure you’re getting at least 1.4 cents of value out of each point.\n\nYou can find Air Serbia award space using ExpertFlyer but you must call Etihad Guest to book an award ticket.\n\nAir Europa\n\nAir Europa is the third-largest airline in Spain, with its largest hub being located in Madrid (MAD). The airline serves a number of intra-Europe routes and also flies from Madrid to the U.S. and various destinations in South America, the Caribbean, South America, Central America and the Middle East.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa\n\nYou’ll earn Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa based on the distance of your flight and fare class, but note that a handful of discounted economy fares are not eligible to earn Etihad Guest miles. You can see the latest Air Europa earning chart on Etihad’s website.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa\n\nAir Europa awards are priced based on distance flown, so be sure to check out Etihad Guest’s website for an up-to-date award chart. Prices are reasonable, but not best-in-class. For example, you can fly one-way from JFK to MAD on Air Europa for 71,000 Etihad Guest miles in business class. That’s higher than the 57,500 miles American Airlines charges for Iberia flights to Madrid or the 59,500 miles required by Air Frace/KLM Flying Blue.\n\nFind Air Europa award space using ExpertFlyer or a SkyTeam search tool.\n\nAir Seychelles\n\nEtihad Guest is the default loyalty program for Air Seychelles. Etihad owns 40% of the Seychelles-based carrier and has helped the small airline beef up its fleet to include two new A320neo planes. The carrier operates international routes between the Seychelles and South Africa, Israel, India and others.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Seychelles\n\nLike many of the airlines discussed, Air Seychelles has its own Etihad Guest earning chart. We’ve posted a copy of the airline’s 2020 earnings chart belowand you can view and up-to-date earning chart on Etihad’s website.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Seychelles\n\nUnfortunately, you can’t redeem your Etihad Guest miles for all Air Seychelles flights. Only certain destinations are eligible for redemption and each has its own respective award cost. Additionally, the Air Seychelles award chart is pricey — for example, a flight from Seychelles (SEZ) to Johannesburg (JNB) costs 60,295 miles one-way in business class.\n\nYou can find Air Seychelles award space using ExpertFlyer.\n\nAlitalia\n\n(Photo by Alberto Riva/TPG)\n\nEtihad currently owns 49% of the Italian flag carrier, Alitalia. While this could change when the Italian government nationalizes the airline, you can currently earn and redeem Etihad Guest points on Alitalia flights.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Alitalia\n\nYou can earn Etihad Guest miles on all Alitalia flights in accordance to the Alitalia-specific award chart. You’ll earn between 50% and 300% bonus miles depending on your booking class. 300% earning on Alitalia business class tickets is significantly higher than other Alitalia partners.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Alitalia\n\nEtihad Guest’s Alitalia award chart lists out a specific price for each of Alitalia’s various routes. As a general rule of thumb, intra-Europe flights are 12,000 miles one-way in economy and 24,000 miles in business class. Meanwhile, flights between the U.S. East Coast and Europe cost 60,000 one-way in economy and 120,000 miles in business class.\n\nThese aren’t particularly great deals, so we recommend booking Alitalia award tickets with a SkyTeam partner like Flying Blue or Delta SkyMiles.\n\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA)\n\nAll Nippon Airways — commonly referred to as “ANA” — and Etihad have a limited partnership that allows Etihad members to earn and redeem miles on all ANA flights. For reference, ANA is based in Tokyo and flies to most major cities in the U.S., Asia and the South Pacific, and also has extensive service in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on ANA\n\nAs of April 2019, you’ll earn Etihad miles on all ANA flights in accordance with the airline’s earning chart. This is a huge upgrade to the pre-2019 earning chart which, at the time, only let Etihad Guest members earn miles on select ANA routes.\n\nEarning rates are pretty standard with ANA: you’ll earn 50% to 150% miles flown, with the 150% being reserved for paid first-class tickets. You can also credit your ANA flights to Star Alliance carriers and Virgin Atlantic, so use a tool like Where To Credit to find the best partner to credit your miles.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on ANA\n\nANA award tickets are based on distance flown, so use GC Mapper to find the length of your flight and compare it to the Etihad Guest ANA award chart. For example, a 6,772-mile flight from New York-JFK to Tokyo-Haneda (HND) would cost 78,000 miles one-way in business class.\n\nThat said, you’d be better off redeeming Aeroplan, ANA Mileage Club or Virgin Atlantic Flying Club miles, which price out awards much cheaper.\n\nYou can find ANA award space using a Star Alliance search engine or ExpertFlyer.\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that Etihad has a non-alliance partnership with American Airlines. American miles have long been one of the best ways to book Etihad awards. Likewise, you can score excellent value when booking certain American Airlines award flights with Etihad Guest miles.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with American Airlines\n\nAs you’d expect, you can earn Etihad Guest miles based on your fare class and the distance of your flight. At the time of publishing this article, you can earn between 25% and 250% of miles flown, depending on your fare class.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with American Airlines\n\nEtihad employs a regional award chart for American Airlines redemptions and there are some great deals to be had. Some of the best deals include American Flagship first-class tickets to Europe for 62,500 miles and JFK to San Francisco (SFO) and Los Angeles (LAX) for 32,500 miles in American’s A321T first class.\n\nYou can see the whole American Airlines award chart on Etihad’s website. You’ll often get a far better deal using Etihad Guest miles instead of AAdvantage miles, so keep this award chart in mind the next time you need to book an American award ticket.\n\nReady to book? Use a Oneworld search tool or ExpertFlyer to look for award space.\n\nAsiana Airlines\n\nAsiana is based in South Korea, with flights to major cities in Asia, Europe and North America. You can earn and redeem Etihad Guest miles on Asiana flights and there are a few good deals to be had if you’re flying from the U.S. to Asia.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Asiana Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when crediting Asiana miles to Etihad Guest, but note that many of the airline’s economy fares aren’t eligible for points earning with Etihad. You’ll earn the most points when booking the airlines’ premium first and business class products.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Asiana Airlines\n\nThe Asiana award chart is based on the distance of your award flight. Flights from the U.S. to Asia generally fall into the 6,000-10,000 mile range. This means that a flight from New York-JFK to Seoul (ICN) would cost 88,000 miles in business class. While not the best deal, it’s about the same as using United miles for the same flight.\n\nOne exception to this are flights from the West Coast to Asia. San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles to ICN flight are under 6,000 miles in distance, so you can book these routes for just 59,000 Etihad miles in business class and 35,000 miles in economy.\n\nYou can find Asiana award space using a Star Alliance search engine or ExpertFlyer.\n\nBangkok Airways\n\nBangkok Airways is a regional carrier based in Thailand. Its route network mostly consists of domestic routes, as well as international destinations like Singapore, Hong Kong and China. This can be a useful partner to have when traveling within Thailand.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Bangkok Airways\n\nThe Bangkok Airways earning chart is pretty simple: you’ll earn 50% to 150% miles flown. Note that many of the airline’s deeply discounted Web Promotion fares are not eligible for mileage earning with Etihad Guest. So be sure to check your fare class before you book.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Bangkok Airways\n\nEtihad’s Bangkok Airways award chart is priced by route and you can see the full award chart on Etihad’s website. Flights start at just 5,000 miles one-way in economy, so these redemptions can be a good option for last-minute or otherwise expensive flights within Thailand.\n\nThere’s no easy way to find Bangkok Airways award space online, so you’ll have to ask an Etihad representative to find the space for you.\n\nBrussels Airlines\n\nBrussels Airlines is a Lufthansa Group airline based in Belgium. While most of the airlines’ routes are intra-Europe, it also offers extensive service to Africa and nonstop flights to New York-JFK, Washington-Dulles (IAD) and Toronto (YYZ).\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Brussels Airlines\n\nYou’ll earn between 25% and 150% miles flown when you credit Brussels Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. See the airline’s earning chart for more details.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Brussels Airlines\n\nLike Bangkok Airways, the Brussels Airways award chart is priced by route. There are plenty of good deals to be had, too — intra-Europe routes start at just 5,000 miles one-way and a business class ticket from JFK to Brussels (BRU) is only 44,000 miles one-way. The ladder redemption is one of our favorite ways to use Etihad Guest miles as it offers the lowest redemption rate on this route.\n\nYou can find Brussels Airlines award space using a Star Alliance search engine like United.com. Alternatively, you can search with ExpertFlyer.\n\nCzech Airlines\n\nCzech Airlines is the flag carrier of the Czech Republic. While the carrier has downsized over time, it still maintains a solid intra-Europe route network and has long-haul service to Seoul (ICN). The airline has a suite of new aircraft on order too, so we may see the return of North American service with its upcoming A321XLR.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Czech Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 150% miles flown when crediting Czech Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. Note that you can only credit flights marketed and operated by Czech Airlines to Etihad; flights booked through the airline’s parent company, Smart Wings, are not eligible for earning.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Czech Airlines\n\nThe Czech Airlines award chart is priced by route, and one redemption sticks out the most: business class from Prague (PRG) to Seoul (ICN). You can book this route for just 25,610 Etihad miles one-way, which is an excellent option for flying from Europe to Asia. Even better, the route is operated by a Korean Airlines A330.\n\nNote that Czech Airlines is set to return this aircraft to Korean Airlines by October 2020, so this route may be coming to an end. Use ExpertFlyer or your favorite SkyTeam search engine to find award space on this route.\n\nGaruda Indonesia\n\nGaurda Indonesia is the largest airline in Indonesia with hubs in Jakarta (CGK) and four other major cities in Indonesia. Its fleet was recently revitalized with some of its newest planes being the 777-300ER and Airbus A330-300neo.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Garuda Indonesia\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when you credit Garuda Indonesia flights to Etihad Guest. Unfortunately, the airline’s cheapest economy tickets only earn 25% with Etihad Guest, so make sure to assess all of your crediting options.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Garuda Indonesia\n\nYou can redeem your Etihad Guest miles on all Garuda Indonesia flights. Awards are priced based on flight distance, with the airline’s longest route — a 7,284-mile jump from London-Heathrow (LHR) to Jakarta (CGK) — costing a whopping 140,000 miles one-way in business class.\n\nFind Garuda Indonesia award space using a SkyTeam search tool or by using ExpertFlyer.\n\nGOL\n\nGOL is the largest domestic carrier in Brazil, with numerous domestic and international routes. The airline even operates flights to the U.S. from its gateways in Miami (MIA) and Orlando (MCO). While the airline recently partnered with American Airlines for mile redemptions, you can score a better deal with Etihad Guest in many cases.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with GOL\n\nYou’ll earn Etihad miles with GOL based on distance flown. While the earning chart only shows earning for economy class awards, the carrier’s premium economy product (referred to as “Max”) earns 125% to 150% miles flown as it books into the C, D, F or L class.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with GOL\n\nThe GOL award chart is distance-based and offers a good deal on short domestic flights. For example, you can book a one-way ticket from Sao Paulo (GRU) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG) for just 3,000 miles in economy class. This flight can get expensive at the last minute, so it’s a good option to have when planning a tour of Brazil.\n\nYou can find GOL award space on ExpertFlyer.\n\nGulf Air\n\nGulf Air is an international airline based in Bahrain, with connections available to major cities in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of its aircraft are outfitted with a new business class product that TPG Writer JT Genter enjoyed on a 2018 flight from London (LHR) to Bahrain (BAH).\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Gulf Air\n\nYou can earn up to 175% miles flown when crediting Gulf Air flights to Etihad. The carrier often has solid deals from Europe to the Middle East, so this can be an interesting way to see another region, experience a new airline and rack up Etihad miles at the same time.\n\nYou can find Gulf Air award space on ExpertFlyer. Unfortunately, the Gulf Air website doesn’t show award availability unless you have enough miles in your account to book the ticket you’re looking for.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Gulf Air\n\nEtihad’s Gulf Air award chart is distance-based. Most Gulf Air routes to Continental Europe fall into the 2,000 to 3,000-tier, so you’ll pay 70,000 Etihad miles for a one-way ticket from Vienna (VIE) or Frankfurt (FRA) to BAH.\n\nHainan Airlines\n\nHainan Airlines is a Chinese carrier offering flights to major cities in Asia, Europe, North America and the South Pacific. The carrier has a relatively new fleet too, with many of its long-haul routes being operated by a mixture of Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 aircraft.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Hainan Airlines\n\nHainan Airlines’ Etihad earning chart awards miles for nearly all booking classes, with first-class tickets earning up to 200% miles flown. Note that Hainan Airlines flights operated by Hong Kong Airlines or another Hainan affiliate are not eligible for earning.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Hainan Airlines\n\nEtihad’s massive Hainan Airlines award chart is distance-based and presents a set of solid deals for short-haul intra-Asia awards. However, we recommend staying away from long-haul awards — you can get a better deal by booking these with Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan.\n\nYou can find Hainan Airlines award space using ExpertFlyer and on the Alaska Airlines website.\n\nKorean Airlines\n\nKorean Airlines is the flag carrier of South Korea and is well-known for its great service and excellent first-class product. Etihad and Korean’s long-time partnership not only offers reciprocal mileage earning, but also extends elite status benefits like lounge access, baggage and priority check-in to Etihad elites traveling on Korean Airlines.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Korean Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when crediting Korean Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. Note that many premium classes earn more miles when crediting to Delta SkyMiles, so do your research and see which loyalty program is best for you.\n\nYou can find Korean Airlines award space on ExpertFlyer and many SkyTeam search tools, but note that not all flights will be bookable with Etihad miles.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Korean Airlines\n\nThe Korean Airlines award chart is distance-based. Do note, however, that Korean Airlines only opens select award tickets to partner bookings, so it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to book Korean Airlines business class with Etihad miles. Likewise, you cannot redeem Etihad miles for Korean Airlines first class.\n\nMalaysia Airlines\n\nMalaysia Airlines is a Oneworld member and the flag carrier of Malaysia, connecting the country to major destinations around the world. The airline currently serves major destinations in Asia, Europe and the South Pacific.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Malaysia Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 150% miles flown when crediting Malaysia Airlines flights to Etihad Guest.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Malaysia Airlines\n\nStrangely enough, Etihad prices Malaysia Airlines awards as round-trip tickets. You can, however, book one-way tickets at half the cost of the prices shown above. Like other airlines on this list, the Malaysia Airlines award chart is distance-based.\n\nAdditionally, you can book stopovers on Malaysia Airlines awards booked with Etihad miles, making these awards particularly useful for multi-stop Asia tours beginning and ending in Malaysia. You can find Malaysia Award space on various Oneworld search engines like AA.com.\n\nOman Air\n\n(Photo courtesy of Boeing)\n\nOman Air connects its home airport of Muscat to over 40 destinations in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. It’s known for its hospitality, with its economy, business and first-class cabins all scoring well in recent TPG reviews.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Oman Air\n\nEtihad recently revamped the Oman Air earning chart, raising the earning rates for a number of fare classes. However, the airline’s cheapest fare — E fare economy — was downgraded to earning just 10% miles flown.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Oman Air\n\nThe Oman Air award chart is priced by destination and its pricing is very reasonable. At the time of writing this article, you can use just 39,000 Etihad miles for a one-way business class flight from Frankfurt (FRA) to Muscat (MCT). This route is operated by the airline’s new 787 aircraft, so you’ll enjoy a posh cabin and a solid hard product.\n\nUnfortunately, however, you must book Oman Air awards at least seven days prior to departure, so you can’t use this for last-minute journeys. Additionally, you can’t search for Oman Air award space online, so you’ll have to call Etihad and have the phone representative find award space for you.\n\nRoyal Air Maroc\n\n(Photo by Brendan Dorsey/The Points Guy)\n\nRoyal Air Maroc is Oneworld’s newest member, but its non-alliance partnership with Etihad is here to stay. Redeeming miles for flights from the U.S. to Morocco is an excellent deal too — a business flight from New York-JFK to Casablanca (CMN) can be booked for less than 50,000 miles.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Royal Air Maroc\n\nEtihad’s Royal Air Maroc earning chart was revamped in late 2019, but it kept earning rates the same for most of the popular business and economy booking classes. You can earn between 75% and 150% miles flown, with the 150% rate being reserved for business class tickets.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Royal Air Maroc\n\nNow for the fun part: redeeming Etihad miles on Royal Air Maroc. The airline’s earning chart is distance-based, with flights above 2,001 miles costing just 44,000 miles one-way in business class. This tier includes all three of Royal Air Maroc’s North American gateways: Montreal (YUL), New York-JFK and Washington-Dulles (IAD), making it one of the best ways to cross the Atlantic with points and miles.\n\nIn addition, Etihad recently added the ability to book stopovers on Royal Air Maroc award tickets. Unfortunately, however, you’ll pay per segment when booking a stopover. This means that a ticket from JFK to CMN to Madrid (MAD) would cost 56,000 miles in business class as CMN to MAD clocks in at 539 miles.\n\nThe bad news? You can’t find Royal Air Maroc award space online, so you’ll have to call Etihad and have the phone representative search for you.\n\nScandinavian Airlines (SAS)\n\nScandinavian Airlines — “SAS” for short — is the largest airline in Northern Europe. It maintains hubs in major Scandinavian cities like Copenhagen (CPH), Stockholm (ARN) and Oslo (OSL) where it flies to major destinations in Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with SAS\n\nYou can only earn miles on select SAS routes, all of which are intra-Europe. Thankfully, the earning rates on these routes are high compared to many Star Alliance programs, so it may be worth a look if you find yourself booked on a flight departing Scanianavia.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with SAS\n\nLike earning miles, you can only redeem your Etihad miles on select SAS routes. The redemption rates aren’t particularly intriguing, especially since cash fares on these routes are already cheap. That said, you may want to skip these redemptions and save your miles for a more exciting award ticket.\n\nIf you’re interested in booking one of these tickets, use ExpertFlyer or your favorite Star Alliance search engine to find award space.\n\nSriLankan Airlines\n\nFinally, we have SriLankan Airlines. This Oneworld carrier flies from its hub in Colombo (CMB) to major destinations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. This includes daily flights to the Maldives, giving you an easy way to connect to tropical paradise from elsewhere in the world.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with SriLankan Airlines\n\nSriLankan Airlines doesn’t serve the U.S., so its earning chart won’t too helpful unless you’re on a trip in West Asia. Regardless, Etihad offers solid earning rates in most booking classes and offers better earning rates than AAdvantage on business class tickets.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with SriLankan Airlines\n\nThe SriLankan Airlines award chart is priced by location and pricing is reasonable. For example, you can book LHR to CMB for 76,000 Etihad miles in business class, which is a good deal given the flight is just over 5,400 miles.\n\nFurther, you can book a one-way flight from CMB to Male (MLE) for just 7,000 miles in business class. This is helpful if you find a cheap cash ticket or open award space to Colombo on another airline and want to continue on to the Maldives.\n\nYou can find SriLankan Airlines award space using ExpertFlyer or your favorite Oneworld search engine.\n\nHotel and rental car partners\n\nYou can also earn Etihad Guest points with the airline’s various hotel and rental car partners. Etihad has partnerships with all of the major hotel groups and rental car companies, so it’s easy to earn bonus Etihad Guest points whenever you’re traveling around the U.S. or abroad.\n\nHere’s an overview of all of Etihad’s non-airline travel partners.\n\nHotel partnerships\n\nEtihad has partnerships with most major hotel chains. Some of them earn a set number of Etihad miles per stay while others earn miles based on how much you spend on a hotel stay. Many hotel loyalty programs let you transfer your hotel points to Etihad Guest as well, though you’ll usually lose value in the process.\n\nHere’s an overview of all Etihad’s hotel partnerships:\n\n \n\nHotel booking websites\n\nPartner\n\nMileage earning\n\nAgoda\n\nEarn up to 10,000 Etihad miles per hotel booking.\n\nBooking.com\n\nEarn 3 to 6 Etihad miles per dollar spent on hotel bookings.\n\nEtihad Travel Rewards\n\nEarn at least 1,000 Etihad miles per night.\n\nKilago\n\nEarn up to 12 Etihad miles per dollar spent.\n\nRocketmiles\n\nEarn up to 10,000 Etihad miles per night.\n\nRental car partners\n\nYou can also earn Etihad miles when you rent a car from select rental car companies — here’s a look at the airline’s rental car partnerships.\n\nPartner\n\nMileage earning\n\nAvis\n\nEarn up to 5 Etihad miles per dollar spent depending on your Etihad elite status tier, plus earn up to 5,000 bonus Etihad miles on your first rental.\n\nBudget\n\nEarn up to 5 Etihad miles per dollar spent depending on your Etihad elite status tier, plus earn up to 5,000 bonus Etihad miles on your first rental.\n\nCareem\n\nEarn 1 Etihad mile per $2 spent.\n\nCredit card transfer partners\n\nEtihad Guest is a transfer partner of three major U.S. transferrable points programs: Amerian Express Membership Rewards, Capital One and Citi ThankYou. Transferring miles from these credit cards is the easiest way for American travelers to quickly earn Etihad Guest miles.\n\nTransferring American Express Membership Rewards to Etihad Guest\n\nYou can transfer Membership Rewards points to Etihad Guest miles at a 1:1 ratio, meaning that 10,000 Membership Rewards points equal 10,000 Etihad Guest miles. In addition, Amex occasionally runs Etihad Guest transfer bonuses which boost this ratio even higher, effectively giving you a points discount on your Etihad bookings.\n\nHere’s a look at some of our favorite credit cards that earn Membership Rewards points (terms apply):\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express – Earn 60,000 points after you spend $5,000 in the first three months of account opening.\n\nAmerican Express® Gold Card – Earn 35,000 points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening.\n\nThe Amex EveryDay® Preferred Credit Card from American Express – Earn 15,000 points after you spend $1,000 in the first three months.\n\nTransferring Capital One miles to Etihad Guest\n\nCapital One added a handful of transfer partners to its travel credit cards last year, with Etihad Guest being one of the first. You can transfer points earned with your Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card to Etihad Guest at a 2:1.5 transfer ratio, meaning that 10,000 Capital One miles equal 7,500 Etihad Guest miles.\n\nThe information for the Capital One Venture Card and the Amex EveryDay Preferred card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nTransferring Citi ThankYou points to Etihad Guest\n\nYou can transfer Citi ThankYou points to Etihad at 1:1 transfer ratio. This is one of the best ways to use your ThankYou points, especially if you’re redeeming your points for a high-value award ticket.\n\nBottom line\n\nTPG has long seen Etihad Guest as one of the most undervalued loyalty programs. The airline has a ton of unique airline partners and great earning and redemption rates, so it’s definitely worth a look if you’re hoping to redeem miles for a premium award to the Middle East, Europe, Asia or beyond.\n\nFeatured photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy.\n\nPartner\n\nMileage earning\n\nCristal Hotels and Resorts\n\nEarn 1 Etihad mile per dollar spent\n\nDanat Hotels and Resorts\n\nEarn 500 Etihad miles per stay\n\nDusit Hotels and Resorts\n\nEarn 500 Etihad miles per stay\n\nHyatt\n\nEarn 500 miles per stay at Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, Hyatt Place and Hyatt Summerfield Suites properties.\n\nTransfer World of Hyatt points to Etihad miles at a 2.5:1 ratio.\n\nInterContinental Hotels Group (IHG)\n\nEarn 500 Etihad miles per stay.\n\nTransfer IHG points to Etihad miles at a 10:2 ratio.\n\nJumeirah Hotels and Resorts\n\nEarn 1 Etihad miles per dollar spent on eligible rates and other on-property expenses.\n\nEarn 5,000 bonus miles on all stays of 15 nights or more regardless of if your rate is eligible.\n\nAccor\n\nTransfer Accor points to Etihad miles at a 2:1 ratio.\n\nMarriott\n\nEarn 2 Etihad miles per dollar spent on qualifying stays at the following brands\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton\n\nJW Marriott\n\nEDITION\n\nAutograph Collection Hotels\n\nRenaissance Hotels\n\nMarriott Hotels\n\nMarriott Vacation Club\n\nGaylord Hotels\n\nDelta Hotels by Marriott\n\nDesign Hotels\n\nLe Méridien\n\nThe Luxury Collection\n\nSheraton\n\nSt. Regis\n\nTribute Portfolio\n\nW Hotels\n\nWestin\n\nEarn 1 Etihad miles per dollar spent on qualifying stays at the following brands\n\nCourtyard by Marriott\n\nFairfield by Marriott\n\nSpringHill Suites by Marriott\n\nResidence Inn by Marriott\n\nTownePlace Suites by Marriott\n\nMarriott Executive Apartments\n\nAC Hotels by Marriott\n\nMOXY Hotels\n\nProtea Hotels by Marriott\n\nAloft\n\nElement by Westin\n\nFour Points by Sheraton\n\nTransfer Marriott points to Etihad Guest at a 3:1 ratio.

          "description": "Emirates is the lap of luxury. If you’ve ever flown their aircraft, it’s otherwordly compared to many other airlines.\n\nOn a recent hop around Africa and the Middle East, I flew a cramped Lufthansa coach from Frankfurt to Johannesburg. My following flight was eight hours in Emirates coach, which literally felt like Premium Economy after the 10-hour CAT scan on Lufthansa.\n\nEmirates is very Dubai — glamorous, golden, and garish. Everything’s fancy and over the top. The airline has objectively one of the best premium cabins among all airlines. First class passengers get to use one of the opulent on-board showers. Emirates even offers an onboard lounge with a bar for first and business class passengers.\n\nI’ll tell you what you need to know about Emirates — how to earn miles, how to reserve award flights, the best deals to book, and what to avoid.\n\nHang out at the onboard bar when you book Emirates first or business class flights with miles. (Photo by Leonard Zhukovsky/Shutterstock)\n\nHow to create an Emirates Skywards account\n\nCreating a frequent flyer account with Emirates is fast — and more importantly, it’s free. Below is all the information you need to open an account. After that, you’ll be sent a unique member number, which will help you to accrue Emirates miles and keep track of your elite status progress and benefits every time you fly.\n\nHow to earn Emirates Skywards miles\n\nEmirates miles are one of the easiest points currencies to earn. That’s because they’re transfer partners of all five flexible points programs! You can acquire Emirates miles by transferring the following points:\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards points – 1:1\n\nEarn Chase points with cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve®\n\nAmex Membership Rewards points – 1:1\n\nEarn Amex points with cards like The Platinum Card® from American Express and American Express® Gold Card\n\nCiti ThankYou points – 1:1\n\nEarn Citi ThankYou points with cards like the Citi Premier℠ Card\n\nCapital One miles – 2:1\n\nEarn Capital One miles with cards like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card and Capital One® Spark® Miles for Business\n\nMarriott points – 3:1\n\nEarn Marriott points with cards like the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card and Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant American Express® Card\n\nThe information for the Capital One Venture, Capital One Spark Miles, and Citi Premier has been collected independently by Million Mile Secrets. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nThere are a number of other ways to earn Emirates miles, including special promos, flying Emirates, transferring other hotel points, and crediting partner airline miles to Emirates. But credit card welcome bonuses are BY FAR the fastest and most efficient way to earn the Emirates miles you need for the amazing flights we’ll cover in this post.\n\nBest uses of Emirates miles\n\nEmirates doesn’t publish an award chart (which is unfortunately rapidly becoming the norm across all airlines), so you’ll have to use this Emirates miles calculator to figure out how many miles you’ll need for your particular trip. Below are the the absolute best deals.\n\nNewark to Athens or Milan\n\nThis is by far the sweetest spot with Emirates miles. You can pay 135,000 miles to fly round-trip between Newark and Athens or Milan in first class. Unbelievable!\n\nA round-trip flight from Newark to Athens covers nearly 10,000 miles. That’s 18+ hours in one of the most luxurious first class seats ever crafted by mankind.\n\nYou’ll get an enclosed suite when flying Emirates first class. (Photo by Agent Wolf/Shutterstock)\n\nThis ticket generally costs ~$7,500 if paid for with cash. That means you’ll see a fantastic value of more than 5.5 cents per point with this strategy.\n\nThe same route is also available for 90,000 miles round-trip in business class and 45,000 miles round-trip in coach. Both are still jaw-dropping prices.\n\nEurope to Dubai\n\nFlying between Europe and Dubai actually costs the same amount of Emirates miles as flying between the U.S. and Europe:\n\n45,000 miles round-trip in coach\n\n90,000 miles round-trip in business class\n\n135,000 miles round-trip in first class\n\nHowever, many flights are significantly shorter. You’ll get more value the farther west you book. For example, a flight between Zagreb and Dubai is just 2,600 miles (or 5.5 hours) each way. That’s 3.5 fewer hours each way than flying from New York to the European countries listed above.\n\nI’d recommend booking a round-trip business class flight for 90,000 miles — very competitively priced with other airlines, but you get Emirates’ incredible business class product, which is still one of the best seats in the world.\n\nShort-haul first class flights for only 45,000 miles round-trip\n\nIf Emirates first class is on your bucket list but you don’t want to burn six figures of your points, there are a couple slightly obscure cities from which you can book first class tickets for 45,000 Emirates miles round-trip:\n\nKuwait to Dubai\n\nRiyadh to Dubai\n\nYes, you can book these first class flights by earning just a single credit card welcome bonus — they’re that cheap. However, neither of these flights are more than 550 miles each way — similar to flying between Detroit and New York City.\n\nIf you’re willing to spend 45,000 miles for a total of 3.5 hours in Emirates’ first class suite, go for it! This ticket sells for around $2,400 had you paid with cash, giving you a value of 5.3 cents each — which is excellent.\n\nFuel surcharges on Emirates award flights\n\nUntil May 2020, fuel surcharges on premium Emirates flights were prohibitively high. Depending on where you were going, you’d find yourself paying $800+ on top of the hundreds of thousands of miles you’d spend on an award flight.\n\nEmirates has chilled out, and you can now book award flights for fewer fees than you’ll find on many other airlines. For example, a one-way flight between Newark to Athens will cost you just $41 in taxes and fees.\n\nCoach prices were never terribly affected by fuel surcharges — but who collects Emirates miles just for coach flights??\n\nEmirates partner awards\n\nBooking partners with Emirates miles\n\nEmirates miles are useful not just for their own airline, but for partners, too. Only a couple strike me as worthwhile.\n\nJetBlue: You can book JetBlue flights starting at 7,500 Emirates miles each way\n\nYou can hop around dozens of cities in Brazil for as little as 4,500 Emirates miles on partner airline Gol.\n\nGo swimming in desert lagoons at Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in Brazil. (Photo by JackViaggiante/Shutterstock)\n\nBooking Emirates with partner miles\n\nEven if you don’t have Emirates miles, you can still book Emirates flights if you have airline miles issued by one of their partners. They are generally BAD DEALS, however. For example, you can book:\n\nU.S. to the Middle East for 150,000 Alaska Airlines miles one-way (ouch)\n\nU.S. to Perth for 135,000 Japan Airlines miles (extremely high fuel surcharges)\n\nU.S to Asia for 180,000 Alaska Airlines miles (ouch)\n\nU.S. to Europe in first class for 100,000 Japan Airlines miles  round-trip (extremely high fuel surcharges)\n\nAs you can see, caveats never cease when booking via partner sites.\n\nBottom line\n\nEmirates miles are very easy to collect if you’ve got any cards that earn in the five major flexible points programs:\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards points\n\nAmex Membership Rewards points\n\nCiti ThankYou points\n\nCapital One miles\n\nMarriott points\n\nThese points transfer to Emirates at varying rates — and surprisingly enough, none are abysmal!\n\nEmirates is most famous for its over-the-top first class cabin. And now that the airline has sharply reduced its fuel surcharges, there are a handful of sweet spots that are hard to ignore, such as Newark to Milan for just 135,000 miles round-trip in first class!\n\nLet us know your favorite way to use Emirates miles.

          "description": "The post below, Police Union Privileges, from 2018 is worth revisiting. As I wrote in a follow-up, police union privileges are only one part of a system and reform requires system-thinking. Nevertheless, getting rid of these special privileges, including so-called qualified immunity and restoring the equal rule of law are good places to start. Need I also mention that police should not keep fines and forfeitures–the negative consequences of which I documented in To Serve and Collect, my paper with Makowsky and Stratmann.\n\n——————\n\nEarlier I wrote about how police unions around the country give to every officer dozens of “get out of jail” cards to give to friends, family, politicians, lawyers, judges and other connected people. The cards let police on the street know that the subject is to be given “professional courtesy” and they can be used to get out of speeding tickets and other infractions. Today, drawing on the Police Union Contracting Project, I discuss how union contracts and Law Officer “Bill of Rights” give police legal privileges that regular people don’t get.\n\nIn 50 cities and 13 states, for example, union contracts “restrict interrogations by limiting how long an officer can be interrogated, who can interrogate them, the types of questions that can be asked, and when an interrogation can take place.” In Virginia police officers have a right to at least a five-day delay before being interrogated. In Louisiana police officers have up to 30 days during which no questioning is allowed and they cannot be questioned for sustained periods of time or without breaks. In some cities, police officers can only be interrogated during work hours. Regular people do not get these privileges.\n\nThe key to a good interrogation is that the suspect doesn’t know what the interrogator knows so the suspect can be caught in a lie which unravels their story. Thus, the Florida Police Bill of Rights is stunning in what it allows police officers:\n\nThe law enforcement officer or correctional officer under investigation must be informed of the nature of the investigation before any interrogation begins, and he or she must be informed of the names of all complainants. All identifiable witnesses shall be interviewed, whenever possible, prior to the beginning of the investigative interview of the accused officer. The complaint, all witness statements, including all other existing subject officer statements, and all other existing evidence, including, but not limited to, incident reports, GPS locator information, and audio or video recordings relating to the incident under investigation, must be provided to each officer who is the subject of the complaint before the beginning of any investigative interview of that officer.\n\nBy knowing what the interrogators know, the suspect can craft a story that fits the known facts–and the time privilege gives them the opportunity to do so.\n\nMoreover, how do you think complainants feel knowing that the police officer they are complaining about “must be informed of the names of all complainants.” I respect and admire police officers but frankly I think this rule is dangerous. Would you come forward?\n\nHow effective would criminal interrogations be if the following rules held for ordinary citizens?\n\nThe law enforcement officer or correctional officer under interrogation may not be subjected to offensive language or be threatened with transfer, dismissal, or disciplinary action. A promise or reward may not be made as an inducement to answer any questions.\n\nWhat does it say about our justice system that the police don’t want their own tactics used against them?\n\nIn the United States if you are arrested–even for a misdemeanor or minor crime, even if the charges are dropped, even if you are found not guilty–you will likely be burdened with an arrest record that can increase the difficulty of getting a job, an occupational license, or housing. But even in the unlikely event that a police officer is officially reprimanded many states and cities require that such information is automatically erased after a year or two. The automatic erasure of complaints makes it difficult to identify problem officers or a pattern of abuse.\n\nLouisiana’s Police Officer Bill of Rights is one of the most extreme. It states that police have the right to expunge any violation of criminal battery and assault and any violation of criminal laws involving an “obvious domestic abuse.” Truly this is hard to believe but here is the law (note that sections (2)(a) and (b) do not appear, as I read it, to be limited to anonymous or unsubstantiated complaints).\n\nA law enforcement officer, upon written request, shall have any record of a formal complaint made against the officer for any violation of a municipal or parish ordinance or state criminal statute listed in Paragraph (2) of this Subsection involving domestic violence expunged from his personnel file, if the complaint was made anonymously to the police department and the charges are not substantiated within twelve months of the lodging of the complaint. (2)(a) Any violation of a municipal or parish ordinance or state statute defining criminal battery and assault. (b) Any violation of other municipal or parish ordinances or state statutes including criminal trespass, criminal damage to property, or disturbing the peace if the incident occurred at either the home of the victim or the officer or the violation was the result of an obvious domestic dispute.\n\nIn an excellent post on get out of free jail cards, Julian Sanchez writes:\n\n…beyond being an affront to the ideal of the rule of law in the abstract, it seems plausible that these “get out of jail free” cards help to reinforce the sort of us-against-them mentality that alienates so many communities from their police forces. Police departments that want to demonstrate they’re serious about the principle of equality under the law shouldn’t be debating how many of these cards an average cop gets to hand out; they should be scrapping them entirely.\n\nEquality under the law also requires that privileges and immunities extend to all citizens equally.\n\nThe post Police Union Privileges Revisited appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "For many travelers, a safari is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The logistics involved in getting to southern or eastern Africa from the U.S. and the cost can pose a challenge to even experienced travelers, and planning a safari is not something typically done on the spur of the moment.\n\nTPG just published a story, in fact, dedicated to planning a bucket-list safari — which says, essentially, that a safari like you’ve seen in National Geographic documentaries does require a lot of planning and won’t come cheap. As for options to use points and miles to book accommodations, those are limited by the absence of international chains away from major cities in Africa. You have more choice when using points and miles to book airfare, but the recent demise of South African Airways has cut the number of relatively cheap options to get to Southern Africa.\n\nNew to The Points Guy? Sign-up for our daily newsletter and check out our beginner’s guide.\n\nBut you don’t have to spend vast amounts to see in the wild the Big Five animals that are the main reason people go on African safaris. Lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and buffalo are all found in reserves that can be easily accessed from Kenya’s Nairobi and South Africa’s Johannesburg, two big, cosmopolitan cities reachable with one stop from major U.S. airports. You may not even have to sleep at a safari camp or lodge.\n\nFor example, in the case of Nairobi National Park, you can wake up at an international-standard hotel that’s part of a major chain. Near the airport, there’s a Hilton Garden Inn, Four Points by Sheraton, Crowne Plaza and Best Western if you want to use your points. From those accommodations, it’s a quick drive to Nairobi National Park where you’ll watch lions hunt gazelles in a real African nature park and be back at your hotel in time for a poolside beer in the late afternoon. And all of this will cost less than the price of some Broadway tickets.\n\nNairobi National Park is just a half-hour drive from downtown Nairobi, and may well be the most unusual national park in the world, turning on its head the commonplace idea that safaris require venturing far into the wilderness. A daylong visit cost me under $300, including entrance fees, pickup and drop-off at my hotel in a Land Rover and the services of a knowledgeable guide. I was by myself, but for a group of four people, the price can drop to just above $100 per person. This isn’t a tamer, lamer version of a real safari: While you’re within sight of the city, the park has lions, leopards, giraffes, hippos, buffalo and more, all wild and behaving exactly as they would in any of the far more famous African game reserves. With any luck, you will take home photos that could have been shot in the Serengeti.\n\nYou won’t find elephants in the park — they’re too massive to be contained within it — but you’ll see them at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust just outside. The center raises orphaned elephants and releases them into the wild when they are ready. It’s well worth a visit, which many tours include with the national park.\n\nA lion in Nairobi National Park (Photo by Alberto Riva/The Points Guy)\n\nI found a reputable tour operator to take me to Nairobi National Park, Wote Group Safaris, through the concierge at my hotel, but there are many options available online. A quick search will turn up several well-recommended names.\n\nWhile Nairobi offers you the ability to replicate a full-blown safari in a day — and an airport with nonstop flights to New York on Delta alliance partner Kenya Airways — in Johannesburg you have to reach a little further out from the city, but budget options are still available. There are several game reserves within a three-hour driving distance of the city and, although none are national parks, many of them offer the chance to see the Big Five in action. You may be able to swing a three-day safari, for example at the Madikwe Game Reserve three and a half hours from Johannesburg, for under $1,000 if you stick to the budget or midrange tour options.\n\nFeatured image by Goddard_Photography/Getty Images\n",

I cannot improve upon Ben Orlin’s description:\n\nYou’re about to spend the next 25 minutes watching a guy solve a Sudoku. Not only that, but it’s going to be the highlight of your day.\n\nThe solver himself calls it “a work of sublime genius” and “one of the most extraordinary puzzles we’ve ever seen”. It’s fascinating listening to him slowly uncover different aspects of the puzzle — watching him methodically figure out the 3s was genuinely thrilling. And the symmetry thing at the end…\n\nIf you fancy yourself a sudoku master, you can try solving the puzzle yourself here (keeping in mind the special chess-related rules laid out in the video).

          "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Trump in most early polls, Democrats are leading polls of the generic congressional ballot by 2018-level margins, and general disapproval of the administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic threatens to sink Republican prospects across the board. On Tuesday, we’ll get a taste of whether Democrats’ electoral advantage on paper will hold up in practice, as California and Wisconsin hold special elections for two vacant congressional seats. The main event is in the California 25th Congressional District, a bellwether seat in the north Los Angeles suburbs, where both parties see a chance to add to their ranks in the House. But if Democrats are also competitive in the quickly reddening, rural Wisconsin 7th Congressional District, it could signal another blue wave in the fall. Here’s everything you need to know about the two races.\n\nCalifornia 25th\n\nThe California contest will test whether Democrats can hold onto a suburban and formerly GOP seat they captured during the 2018 blue wave. This election — precipitated by the resignation of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill in November after she admitted to an affair with a campaign staffer — marks the second round of voting as no candidate won an outright majority on March 3 to claim the seat. So now Democrat Christy Smith and Republican Mike Garcia — the top-two finishers in that initial vote — are battling it out on Tuesday to serve out the remainder of Hill’s term, which ends January 2021. But regardless of who wins, Smith and Garcia will face off again in November because they both advanced from the regular primary, also held on March 3.\n\nWe don’t have much polling to go on, but the contest looks close. The last public poll of the race dates back to an internal poll the Garcia campaign released in March. In it, Garcia led Smith, 43 percent to 39 percent. According to Inside Elections, private polling has consistently found Garcia leading by the low single digits. Election handicappers rate it a toss-up. And Smith — a first-term assemblywoman in California’s legislature — and Garcia — a businessman and former Navy fighter pilot — have each raised and spent around $2 million. (The national party campaign arms — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee — have also been busy, too, collectively spending over $3 million in the district.) However, the once-conservative district has shifted left over the last few years: Mitt Romney won it by 2 points in 2012, but Hillary Clinton carried it by 7 points in 2016, according to data from Daily Kos Elections.\n\nOne of the big issues in the race, though, may be a state issue: Assembly Bill 5, a new law Smith supported in the legislature that limits businesses’ ability to label workers as independent contractors, rather than employees (who are entitled to employment-related benefits that independent contractors would otherwise not receive), has experienced widespread backlash. Critics argue it’s made it harder for freelancers and gig workers to find jobs, and the economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic has made it a potential landmine for Smith — it’s one of Garcia’s main talking points. It’s not Smith’s only controversy either; she’s also received blowback after a video leaked in which she appeared to mock the Garcia campaign’s focus on highlighting his military service.\n\nThe special election will also be a testing ground for conducting an election during a pandemic. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order requiring counties to mail every voter a ballot, though that doesn’t mean everyone will vote by mail. The district has a limited number of in-person voting sites, and the late addition of one in the city of Lancaster — a move supported by the city’s Republican mayor — prompted Trump to tweet that the election is being “rigged” by Democrats. But Garcia and Smith haven’t been able to rely on traditional get-out-the-vote techniques as they fight for every vote in the final days of the campaign. Instead, they’ve had to mount campaigns built more on videoconferencing, virtual town halls and phone banking than typical door-knocking.\n\nAnd as always, who votes will matter. About 118,000 ballots had been returned as of May 11, according to Political Data, Inc, and at first blush, they bode well for Garcia — registered Republicans have cast 44.5 percent of them versus 35.6 percent by Democrats, plus 20.0 percent by independents or other parties. But these figures aren’t all that different from the ballots that had been returned the day before the March 3 contest, when registered Republicans had cast 45.0 percent of ballots compared to 36.6 percent by Democrats, plus 18.4 percent by others. Yet in the first round of voting, the Democratic candidates combined to win 51 percent of the vote, while Republicans won 49 percent. (It’s worth noting, though, that about twice as many voters have returned mail ballots for this election than just before the March 3 contest, as most votes will be cast by mail because of the pandemic.) In other words, party registration data at this point doesn’t tell the whole story because younger and minority voters are more likely to cast late-arriving ballots and they’re more likely to vote Democratic. In California, ballots must be postmarked on or by Election Day, but they can be received up to three days after.\n\nThere’s a lot at stake in the California 25th — and as is often the case with California, it could be a few days before we know the outcome.\n\nWisconsin 7th\n\nHalfway across the country, Wisconsin is holding another election just five weeks after drawing widespread criticism for not canceling its presidential primary amid the pandemic. After the many mishaps of that election, Gov. Tony Evers reportedly considered postponing the 7th District special, but never pulled the trigger — perhaps fearing that a court would overturn his decision yet again.\n\nSo just like last month, polling places will be open in Wisconsin on Tuesday, and just like last month, some poll workers are begging out of working the election and the National Guard is being called in to help. It’s unclear, however, how many headaches will ensue. There have been no widespread reports of polling-place closures, and the ruralness of the district minimizes the potential for long lines. (In April, the longest lines were reported in urban areas like Milwaukee and Green Bay, which are not voting on Tuesday; the biggest city in the 7th District is Wausau, population less than 40,000.) Indeed, the Wisconsin Elections Commission insists that the state is better prepared for May’s election than it was for April’s, because there have been no legal challenges pushing to change the rules of the election and officials now have experience running an election mid-pandemic.\n\nHowever, just like last month, many more Wisconsinites than normal are opting to vote by mail. As of Monday morning, local officials had reported receiving 112,892 absentee-ballot applications, a comparable number to the April election. Indeed, in the 21 counties wholly contained within the 7th District, 103,402 ballots had been requested for the special election compared with 101,846 for the April primary. Last month, this volume of absentee-ballot requests overwhelmed election offices and led to many people not getting mailed their ballot in time to vote.\n\nHowever they vote, residents of the Wisconsin 7th will elect either Republican state Sen. Tom Tiffany or Democrat Tricia Zunker, the president of the Wausau School Board, to be their next member of Congress. This northwestern Wisconsin district was once a hotbed of Democratic populism, represented by progressive former Rep. Dave Obey for 42 years and voting for Barack Obama by 8 points in 2008.1 But a huge bloc of non-Hispanic white residents without bachelor’s degrees — 72 percent of the population age 25 or older — has turned the 7th District into Republican turf. Former Rep. Sean Duffy, whose resignation for family reasons in September triggered this special election, flipped the seat red in 2010, and Romney won here by a narrow margin in 2012. But Trump put an exclamation point on the district’s realignment when he carried it by more than 20 points in 2016.\n\nZunker can hope that the district’s ancestral Democratic tradition means there are latent Democratic votes for her to activate. But even the strongest liberal candidates have failed to carry the Wisconsin 7th in recent years. According to Daily Kos Elections, Sen. Tammy Baldwin lost it by 5 points in 2018, and according to J. Miles Coleman of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice-elect Jill Karofsky lost it by 6 points last month.\n\nIn addition, as of April 22, Tiffany had outspent Zunker $1.1 million to $328,000. So even though there have been no public polls of the race, the GOP is the clear favorite on Tuesday, with election handicappers rating it “Solid Republican.”\n\nStill, pay attention to the final margin, both here and in California. When a party consistently overperforms its usual partisan baseline in special elections, it bodes well for that party in the general election as well. So even a narrow loss by Zunker, if paired with a comfortable Smith win, would add to the evidence that another Democratic wave is building.\n",

          "description": "Joe Biden holds a virtual campaign event on March 13, in Chicago, Illinois. The scheduled in-person campaign event was canceled due to Covid-19. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus shows tying health insurance to jobs is a disaster. Let’s fix it. \n\nAccording to a new analysis by the consulting firm Health Management Associates (HMA), the Covid-19 crisis could lead to between 12 million and 35 million people losing employer-sponsored health coverage due to job losses.\n\nNot all of them will tumble into the ranks of the uninsured. Some will be caught by Medicaid, by Obamacare, or by other safety net programs. Some will find new jobs, with new insurance. But millions will fall through the cracks, particularly in states that have refused to expand Medicaid. In a scenario where unemployment hits 25 percent — calamitous, but plausible — HMA forecasts that as many as 11 million people could find themselves uninsured. That wipes out about half of Obamacare’s coverage gains, practically overnight.\n\n Health Management Associates\n\nHere, as elsewhere, Covid-19 is worsening a policy problem that long predates the virus. Tying health insurance to employment is now, and always has been, a disaster. It gives bosses too much power over workers, reduces entrepreneurship, saddles businesses with health costs they can’t control and insurance problems they don’t understand, makes the tax structure more regressive, reduces wages, bloats administrative spending, and drives up costs throughout the system.\n\nIt has also, as Paul Starr writes in Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle Over Health Care Reform, created a “policy trap” that has stymied health reformers over and over again: About 160 million Americans get insurance through their employers, and for all the system’s flaws, they are mostly pretty happy with that insurance, which makes them resistant to disruptive change.\n\nBut disruptive change is here, whether anyone wants it or not. It won’t just be felt in the rising ranks of the uninsured, in the millions of people who lose the insurance provided by their workplace and have to scramble, desperately, for an alternative. It will also be felt by those who keep their job-based insurance, only to see it degrade as their employer rushes to cut costs.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, average premiums for employer-based insurance have risen 54 percent over the past decade — far outpacing wages or inflation. Cost-sharing has increased, too: Average annual deductibles have doubled in the past decade. Employers have been shunting health costs onto employees in both good times and bad, and these are the worst times. Many of those who keep their employer-based insurance will see their premiums and deductibles rise, their networks narrow.\n\n Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nThis is a crisis. But it is also, perhaps, an opportunity to solve the policy trap and finally move beyond employer-based insurance.\n\nThe two poles of the Democratic health care debate\n\nThe Democratic primary was defined by the debate over Bernie Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan, which, in its expansive and uncompromising ambition, rolled a number of health reform debates into one. But one of its best features, substantively, was that it ended employer-based insurance forever.\n\nThe problem is that canceling 160 million insurance plans is likely to be a political catastrophe. When polled, it routinely turned people against Medicare-for-all. Most members of Congress — including some co-sponsors of Sanders’s bill — blanched at that level of disruption. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed it, as did the Senate Democrats who will lead the next health care push. The logic was straightforward: If the problem you’re trying to solve is that people hate losing the insurance their employer gives them, forcibly taking it away from them isn’t likely to go over well.\n\nMoreover, the tax increases necessary to move the entirety of the employer-based system onto the federal budget would be eye-popping. That’s what killed the statewide single-payer push in Sanders’s home state of Vermont, and Sanders never said how he’d solve it nationally.\n\nBut if the political weakness of Sanders’s plan is that it upends too much of the current system, the substantive weakness of Biden’s plan is that it does too little to transform the current system.\n\nBiden’s plan leaves the current system more or less intact, but adds a subsidized, Medicare-based public option available to individuals and small businesses. Under the Biden proposal, the employer-based system remains, but if you lose your job, or simply don’t like or can’t afford the insurance offered by your employer, you have another option. The plan would also serve low-income Americans in states that refused to expand Medicaid, giving them an option they desperately need.\n\nBut the Biden team made a series of policy choices to limit the impact their public plan would have on employer-based health insurance. Large employers are not allowed to buy into the new public option. Individuals can’t use the money their employer is spending on private health insurance to buy into the public option. What they’ve built isn’t a glide path to Medicare-for-all, or even to a new hybrid system. Instead, they’ve created a backstop to reinforce the current system, with all its flaws. And over the next year, the coronavirus is going to make those flaws gruesomely apparent.\n\n BernieSanders.com via Getty Images\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders announces the suspension of his presidential campaign on April 8.\n\n John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune via Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden campaigns in Flint, Michigan, on March 9.\n\nThe Biden team’s fear is that opening the public option to all employers would destabilize the employer-based system — companies with sicker, older workforces would rush into the public system, driving up its costs, or perhaps they would nudge their older, sicker employees to enter into it so they could offload their spending onto taxpayers. These concerns are reasonable, but they’re also manageable. Whether you choose to solve them reflects whether you think the American health care system is fundamentally broken or just needs to be patched up.\n\nBiden’s plan would require far less in new taxes than Sanders’s plan — the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the 10-year cost of Biden’s proposal at $2.25 trillion while Sanders’s bill clocked in at $30.6 trillion — but even pre-coronavirus, CRFB estimated that it would still leave 10 million to 15 million people uninsured. Post-coronavirus, it will leave millions more uninsured, and it will have little to offer those who keep their employer-based plan but find themselves paying more and more for less and less.\n\nWith Sanders’s exit from the race, Biden is a lock to win the Democratic nomination. But his win will leave many progressives disappointed. Biden needs a way to reach out to them. A good place to start would be a better health care plan — one that’s truly universal and that ends employer control over health insurance.\n\nI think the disunity might be driven by real cleavages such as the fact that millions of people are currently getting kicked off their private health insurance in the middle of a public health crisis and Joe Biden stubbornly opposes a policy to untether insurance from employment\n\n— Meagan Day (@meaganmday) April 8, 2020\n\nBiden isn’t going to embrace Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan. But he can do better than his current health care proposal, and he should. I can even suggest a place for him to start.\n\nMedicare Extra is the middle ground Democrats need\n\nBack in July, the Center for American Progress released its “Medicare Extra” proposal. As I wrote at the time, the plan was, and is, an intriguing synthesis of left and moderate ideas on health reform. It’s universal, it uses Medicare’s pricing power to hold down costs, it rebuilds the health system around public insurance — and it gives everyone, everywhere, a true choice between public and private options, no matter what their employer is offering. In all those ways, it goes much further than Bidencare.\n\nAt the same time, Medicare Extra retains private insurance options, allows employers to continue offering insurance to employees if they think they can provide something better than the public option, and it holds the total price tag to somewhere in the $2.8 trillion to $4.5 trillion range. Which is to say, it’s not nearly as disruptive as Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill, and it only requires about a tenth of the tax increases.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nMedicare Extra builds a new public insurance program called, well, Medicare Extra. The new plan shares Medicare’s name, but its benefits are much more expansive: It includes, for instance, vision, dental, and reproductive health coverage.\n\nEveryone in the system, from individuals getting insurance from their employer to traditional Medicare enrollees, could choose to purchase Medicare Extra instead, and they’d be eligible for normal subsidies and employer cash-outs if they did so. So unlike in Biden’s plan, employers could buy Medicare Extra for their employees, and even if they didn’t, employees could take the money their employer is spending on private insurance and use it to buy Medicare Extra.\n\nPremiums are on a sliding scale, with Americans under 150 percent of the poverty line paying nothing and those making 500 percent of the poverty line or more seeing their total contribution capped at 9 percent of income. Cost-sharing, too, varies by income, with total out-of-pocket spending, even for the richest, capped at $5,000.\n\nNewborns would automatically be enrolled in Medicare Extra, as would the uninsured and every legal resident upon turning 65. Medicaid and Obamacare would be folded into the new program, and anyone on traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Tricare, Veterans Affairs coverage, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Indian Health Service, or employer-sponsored coverage could opt in.\n\nThe plan saves money by expanding Medicare’s pricing power throughout the system — including to employer-provided private insurance. It’s the first of the major Democratic proposals to rely on a version of all-payer rate setting.\n\nThere are plenty of details and decisions in this plan worth debating. But something like Medicare Extra offers a middle ground that this moment demands. It eases the disruption of reform without reinforcing the dysfunctions of the status quo; it makes employer-provided health insurance one option people can freely choose, if they prefer it, rather than making it the only option most people have; and it creates a system that, while not single-payer, is far more integrated than anything we have now: a public system with private options, rather than a private system with fractured public options.\n\nSo far, Biden has done a good job releasing plans and making statements about how he would manage the coronavirus crisis. What he hasn’t done is reveal a vision for rebuilding in its aftermath. He’s offering a candidacy to feel relieved about, rather than inspired by. But coronavirus, and the damage it will unleash on an already broken health care system, demands more than that.\n\nFinding a synthesis in the health reform debate, one that respects the moderate’s fear of disruption, the leftist critique of the status quo, and the post-coronavirus reality that now surrounds us, would be a good place to start.\n\nSupport Vox’s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

The bus is more space-efficient than a car, and a train is even more space-efficient than a bus.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, that’s great. Faced with an infectious respiratory disease for which there’s no vaccine and few proven treatments, it’s a catastrophe. So agencies are cutting service, actively discouraging ridership, and running what service remains in a deliberately inefficient way that violates the basic logic of mass transit. Even while all that happens, they’re incurring extra expenses to regularly clean and disinfect everything.\n\nIn terms of what America needs to get through this crisis, all of that is exactly correct. The problem is these agencies need fare revenue, and without it, the basic transit infrastructure of many urban areas could collapse.\n\nBut the federal government can save the day.\n\nMass transit is facing multiple economic stresses\n\nJarrett Walker, a private consultant on mass transit issues, reported as far back as March 10 that “unpublished numbers shared with me by two US West Coast agencies showed ridership losses of 30-50% from pre-crisis levels.”\n\nThat’s from before the government started really working hard to discourage people from leaving the house and going places. More recent data indicates ridership has fallen over 80 percent.\n\nAt the same time, the American Public Transit Association reports that its agencies expect to see $1.75 billion in increased costs related to increased cleaning of transit vehicles. If in the not-too-distant future, basic supplies like masks become more widely available for drivers’ use, that would be a further win for public health but a further cause of increased costs.\n\nEven as their costs go up, transit authorities could see their revenue streams dry up. Most rely on $13 billion per year in earmarked sales tax revenue generated in their service areas — much of which will vanish as a result of social distancing orders. And to the extent that agencies don’t depend on that kind of revenue stream, they are typically counting on ad hoc subsidies from state and local governments, which themselves count on sales tax money that is going to be vanishing.\n\nThe risk is that even as the most acute phase of the coronavirus crisis hopefully abates, transit will enter a death spiral of lost revenue, service cuts, and ridership losses from which it’s incredibly difficult to recover. Agencies will have no alternative but to respond to financial pressure by scaling back service — cutting routes, shortening hours, and reducing frequency. But cutting frequency makes a transit network much less useful, ensuring that ridership doesn’t bounce back even when restrictions on activity fade away. And collapsed ridership means agencies won’t have the revenue to restore service.\n\nUnless, that is, they get a bunch of money.\n\nTransit operating subsidies are highly effective stimulus\n\nThe alternative is that the federal government could give transit agencies a huge stimulus.\n\nCurrently, the federal government offers financial assistance to mass transit capital projects — building new lines — but does not subsidize transit operating costs. That’s a perfectly reasonable stance to take. Transit is great, but it’s also very much a local benefit that under ordinary times should be financed out of fares and local revenue.\n\nBut faced with a looming economic crisis and an urgent need for federal stimulus efforts — some of which will likely include bailouts for other industries — transit operating subsidies are an appealing choice. The logistics of getting the money out the door are easy, for starters, and the public transit industry directly supports about as many employees as the airline industry. For the duration of the crisis, maintaining little-used transit service is an urgent national priority and a simple form of financial assistance to needy individuals would be to not just finance its provision but make it free.\n\nIn the longer term, once we are hopefully in a position to try to get people out and doing things again, making sure cities have viable transit systems is an excellent way to ensure that it’s possible for people to get to work without breaking the bank. At a certain point you’d want to withdraw financial support, just as you wouldn’t want to see Congress bailing out whole industries on a routine basis. But as long as the federal government is looking at help for corporate America, it should let transit agencies in on the action as well.\n",

          "description": "If you’re a frequent TPG reader, your life has likely been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its resulting impact on travel.\n\nNumerous TPG readers have told us that they booked nonrefundable reservations because they didn’t plan to cancel their trip. Others purchased travel insurance, but most trip insurance doesn’t cover epidemics so they’re still out the money. In many such cases, your best bet is to reach out directly to the airline or hotel in question and ask for help.\n\nRelated: Will “cancel for any reason” insurance protect your trip?\n\nTPG has covered how to reach customer service as quickly as possible — but what should you ask for once you get on the phone?\n\nBe clear about what you need\n\nBefore you get on the phone, know where you want to go before you reach out to your airline to make any changes. A customer service representative can’t tell you whether or not it’s best for you to go home to your own apartment, or shelter in place at your parents’ house in another state, and it isn’t their job to wait on the line while you draft up a pros-and-cons checklist.\n\nRelated: A number of airlines have suspended all routes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nHave your desired airport code, travel times and dates, your passport number and record locator, and any other personal information ready on hand before you reach out. And be prepared for long hold times, or try reaching out via Twitter or text.\n\nBe flexible on how you accomplish your goal\n\nIt’s great to have a specific plan in place, but keep your big picture goal in mind. Right now, your top priority should be safety and speed, not necessarily convenience or efficiency. If you’re trying to get home to Brooklyn or Queens, be willing to consider flying into Newark, Philly or even Boston. Similarly, flying into Oakland, San Jose or even Sacramento could be a good alternative to San Francisco if you need to get back to the Bay Area.\n\nAlternatively, consider renting a car and driving where you need to go if the journey isn’t too long — or if you’re up for taking the scenic route home. The main goal of social distancing is increasing the amount of physical distance between you and other people, and a road trip fulfills most of the criteria. Keep in mind that most hotels and stores along the way may be closed or operating under limited hours, so stock up on gas and supplies well before setting out. \n\nNegotiation strategy: Big ask, little ask\n\nIf you know that you can’t or won’t need to travel any longer, you’ll probably want your money (or points) back instead of rescheduling your trip for a later date. But just because your friend got a full refund on an international flight through Delta Airlines doesn’t mean you’ll get the same result for canceling a domestic flight on Spirit.\n\nRelated: Your complete guide to traveling during the coronavirus outbreak\n\nHere’s where a sales negotiation strategy called “big ask, little ask” could help you accomplish your goal.\n\nThe concept here is to have at least two satisfactory outcomes in mind, and to ask for the bigger favor first. If that fails, then ask for the smaller favor. In contrast, the smaller request will seem easier to grant, and you’ll be more likely to get what you ask for.\n\nYour success will vary based on a lot of factors, but it never hurts to try — and it really pays to be as polite as humanly possible.\n\nLet’s say you purchased a $400 nonrefundable ticket, and your airline is offering you free changes for the travel dates. But the event you wanted to attend was canceled, so you no longer plan to take this trip. When you reach out to customer service, go for the “big ask” first: A full refund. Be polite, explain your circumstances, and nicely ask if the agent can help you out. If the answer is yes, then great; if no, then switch to your “little ask”, which could be a voucher toward future travel instead of rescheduling your flight.\n\nRelated: I booked my canceled trip using an airline voucher. Will the airline issue me a new one? \n\nChances are, you’ll find some leniency from the representative. And even if you don’t, you can walk away knowing you did your best.\n\nPriority goes to travelers who need immediate assistance\n\nTrying to cancel a spring break trip in April? Don’t get on the phone; save customer service hotlines for people who need immediate help resolving their travel issues.\n\nRelated: Use Chase’s online tool to rebook or cancel your Ultimate Rewards itinerary\n\nInstead, reach out to your airline or online travel agency (OTA) via email, Twitter or text. You can avoid long hold times, possibly increase your chances of getting a favorable response, and know that you’re doing your fellow traveler a favor by freeing up the phone lines.\n\nRemember that you’re on the same team — and be kind\n\nThese are stressful times with little to no prior precedent, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Remember that you and the customer service agent share the same goal of getting you where you need to go, even if it doesn’t feel that way.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these agents have been dealing with frustrated customers for weeks, and are facing job uncertainty themselves. Be kind and thoughtful to the person helping you — a “thank you” or a “How are you doing?” goes a long, long way right now.\n\nFeatured photo by Getty Images.\n",

          "description": "Ventana Big Sur is an adults-only resort in Big Sur California.  Ventana is part of Hyatt’s Alila luxury brand and currently the only Alila property in the United States (although a second Alila is being developed in Encinatas, north of San Diego).  We stayed four nights in early March and paid 30,000 points per night.  A friend with Globalist status booked our stay for us as a Guest of Honor reservation.  This gave us all of the perks of top-tier Globalist status during the stay (free breakfast, suite upgrade, etc.).  Cash rates at Ventana are often over $1,000 per night, but rates were under $600 per night during our stay.  Even then, 30,000 points per night resulted in very good value for our points especially when considering that we didn’t have to pay resort fees (Hyatt doesn’t charge resort fees on award bookings).\n\nVentana Big Sur Bottom Line Review\n\nWow.  Wow.  Wow.  Did I say “wow”?  Wow.\n\nMy wife and I loved everything about Ventana.  The property itself is beautiful.  The surrounding area (Big Sur) is fantastic.  Our suite was awesome.  We plan to return often.\n\nThis is not the place to go if you want to play golf or tennis.  You won’t find those options here.  This is not a place to bring kids — it’s adults only.  This is a place to relax, to enjoy nature at its most beautiful, and to bring your dog — dogs are welcome here.\n\nPoints Price: Category 7, 30,000 points per night standard, 25,000 off-peak, or 35,000 peak\n\nPoint value: Excellent.  Base rooms often cost over $1,000 per night, so even at peak award pricing you’ll often get 3 cents per point value or more.\n\nLocation: Excellent.  Big Sur is a gorgeous area.  The drive itself, along highway 1 is breathtaking.\n\nResort Dining: Excellent.  Breakfast was very good and the ocean view when seated outside was incredible.  We ate dinner at the resort restaurant (The Sur House) once, and it was fantastic.\n\nRoom: We were upgraded to the Vista Hot Tub Suite.  It was a huge one-room suite with a very large and private rear patio featuring nature views and, of course, a hot tub. We loved everything about the suite.\n\nComplementary Activities:\n\nMorning Yoga and Tai chi (we didn’t do either)\n\nGuided property hike daily at 10 am (this was very good)\n\nCocktails and snacks daily from 4 to 5 (loved this)\n\nPet friendly: We didn’t bring a pet, but there were many dogs on property and they seemed very happy.\n\nService: Excellent\n\nTurn-down service? Yes, daily turn-down service included delicious chocolates.\n\nResort fee: $50 per day, includes valet parking.  Keep in mind that Hyatt doesn’t charge resort fees on award stays, so we didn’t have to pay this.  Those with top-tier Globalist status don’t pay on resort fees on paid stays either.\n\nMisc:\n\nWelcome gift: We had notified the resort ahead of time that we would be celebrating a major anniversary and so they delivered a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nNo phone service for me: I can’t remember the last time I went four straight days with no phone signals.  I use Google Fi which is on T-Mobile’s network.  T-mobile seems to have given Big Sur a hard pass.  My wife had service most of the time via AT&T.\n\nHyatt Elite Benefits: Excellent…\n\nWe were upgraded to a suite the day before check-in (we could see the room assignment through the Hyatt app)\n\nBreakfast was free, up to $82 per day, either at the Sur House restaurant or for in-room dining.  If the weather is good, I highly recommend going to the Sur House.\n\nThe desk agent proactively told us that we were eligible for 4pm late checkout (but we didn’t need it since we had a plane to catch).\n\nWould I stay again?  Duh.\n\nPhotos and captions follow…\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite. As you can see, our room was enormous. In the far corner you’ll spot a wood burning fireplace.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite. My wife and I enjoyed the wood burning fireplace every evening.  Ventana stocks each room with firewood held in flammable bags.  Simply stick the bag into the fireplace and light it.  Done.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite rear patio. Even though there were units on each side of us, the patio was designed to be completely private (if you don’t count the deer that occasionally peeked at us).\n\n \n\nDeer peeking at us from ridge\n\nAnother view of the Vista Hot Tub Suite rear patio. You can see the bathroom soaking tub through the window on the right.  The furthest right window is the bathroom shower.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite soaking tub and shower. The shower was stocked with home-made (I think?) exfoliating bar soap. We loved this.\n\nView from path near our suite.\n\nThe Ventana’s restaurant is a short walk through Redwood trees. They’ll alternatively drive you there on a golf cart, but come on… this was a fantastic little walk each morning!\n\nBreakfast at the Ventana’s Sur House Restaurant.\n\nAnother view of breakfast dining at the Sur House.\n\nGlass House Gallery next to the Sur House restaurant.\n\nRedwood Trees!\n\nVentana also offers Glamping tents like this one.

          "description": "When given the opportunity to establish a process, we’re all biased to advocate for one in which we would be successful ourselves. In hiring, this plays out in two main ways: “A” players build monocultures, hiring people just like them, and “B” players hire “C” players, hiring people who won’t threaten them.\n\nIn other words, top performers too narrowly define what top performance is, and okay performers hire mediocre people; in both cases, they’re making selections that bolster their own position.\n\nThere are several telltale warning signs of a poor hiring process:\n\nUncompelling job descriptions. Test your job posting with people you think would be great in the role—send them the description and ask if they have any feedback. If your ideal person doesn’t read the job description and find it compelling, you have more work to do.\nWeak applicant pools. If your interest level is low, then your option set will be small. It’s also much harder to calibrate from a small inbound applicant pool. Especially for a new role, it’s worth interviewing a lot more people than you want to. Talking to interested people will help you understand the role, expectations, and motivations of your candidates better, while giving you a better window into what you, the hiring manager, can expect.\nHigh withdrawal rates. Do you have a low response rate on emails to potential candidates? You need to revisit the text of the email and the job description. Do people decline to participate in your process? You need to revisit it. Do people decline the offer once made? You need to understand what’s propelling that: role, salary, team, or another factor.\n\nWhat to do?\n\n1. Acknowledge the bias, and let it go\n\nThe first step toward reducing bias is to acknowledge the bias that’s there. Notice how this shows up for you: Are you defensive about some of the potential changes you need to make because you know you wouldn’t do well if you were held to them? Are you overvaluing things that have made you successful? Try and step back and see that the process is just that—a process—not a value judgment on you.\n\n2. Reset your expectations\n\nIt’s quite possible that the skills that were prized or evaluated when you were hired are not the skills that are most needed today. It’s almost certain you’ve learned and grown since then anyway (and if not, maybe that’s the problem you should be looking to solve).\n\nWe tend to either overvalue our own skills or take them for granted. Spend some time thinking about what makes different people effective, and about the hidden work that goes into it. Learn to value and articulate specific actions that lead to specific outcomes.\n\nWhatever the case when you were hired, what is needed for success today? Think about what you want to add to the team and what your current process selects for. Invariably, there is a gap to fill, and the size of the gap implies what you do next. Minor gaps have minor fixes, major gaps require a major rethink.\n\nAs dispassionately as possible, consider what success looks like in this role, and the kind of impact a strong performer could have. Try and differentiate between key skills and learned behaviors. For example, when hiring a senior engineer into a complex code base, an ability to grapple with the complexity is not negotiable. Being able to use Git effectively is key to being successful—but very much learnable on the job, so don’t rule people out on the basis that they have been using another system of software-version control.\n\n3. Articulate definite skills and behaviors, and why they are important\n\nOnce you’ve understood the success factors in different roles, you can identify key skills and behaviors in your job descriptions, and articulate why they are important. Some examples from a recent round of hiring we did for an in-house recruiter:\n\nExperience at scale—operating a scaled process is very different from a low volume process, and requires people to be able to cope with a lot of context switching and navigate potential overwhelm. Whilst in time we may be able to train people up in this and evaluate potential, at this time we need people who have done it before.\n\nInternational experience—we hire internationally and understanding the variabilities of the international job market is key. Resumes are highly localised, expectations and communication vary between cultures. Someone who has only operated in one job market, particularly if only the US, will lack a perspective that is required to be successful.\n\nIt’s important to select for behaviors rather than characteristics. For example, responding well to feedback is a key attribute for a strong hire, as it’s a strong predictor of coachability. We can look for a characteristic commonly associated with this (“this person has a graduate degree, so….”), or, better yet, we can test the behavior (i.e. give them feedback, and see how they respond).\n\n4. Standardize rubrics for more objective evaluation\n\nIn a small-scale process, you can create consistency by having one or two people do things. At scale, this is impossible and rubrics are imperative. However, even at low scale, it’s been demonstrated that standardization leads to fairer outcomes. Having clear things you’re evaluating for helps distinguish charisma from competence, and allows you to get closer to data than gut feeling.\n\nStandardization also helps with calibration. If you look back at previous hiring decisions, what turned out to be a strong predictor of success at the next step or in the role itself? What turned out to be irrelevant? If you haven’t structured your decision-making process, it’s harder for you to learn from it.\n\nWe’ve all made a bad hire—even in the best process, it happens. The instances that are most glaring often come from a fundamental lack of understanding of the role.\n\nThe more you understand what the job entails, the better you can write a compelling job description and evaluate it. It may feel like you don’t have the time because you need to fill that spot yesterday, but nothing will sink more time than having someone on your team who doesn’t have the skills they need to be successful.\n\nCate Huston is an engineering manager at Automattic, where she has led the mobile and Jetpack teams.\n",

          "description": "Chris, a loyal MR reader, writes to me:\n\nI’ve been turning to your insights on prizes vs. grants over the years. Your Google talk from 2007 is without question the best discussion I’ve found of their respective merits…I was wondering if your thinking on prizes vs. grants has evolved, and in particular [TC has added the numbers here]:\n\n1. In the Google talk, you talked about an equilibrium in which there would be a growing ecosystem of big prizes complementing one another. I’m not sure it has turned out this way. Do you agree, and what happened? Did the “failure” of some high profile prizes (e.g. the Google Lunar XPrize) dampen down the enthusiasm?\n\n2. More generally, there seemed to be an expectation in the 2000s and early 2010s that prizes would take off and become a more significant feature of the R&D funding landscape. Again, I don’t think that has really happened. What explains that?\n\n3. Looking specifically at government funding of R&D, do you think there is an equilibrium in which grants can coexist with prizes? Or do grants squeeze out prizes through some form of adverse selection (the best researchers opting for grants over prizes)?\n\n4. How important do you think public choice reasons are for us being in a grant-dominated equilibrium? It seems that the science sector has done a great job of positioning itself as something other than an interest group, with its interests squarely aligned with the public good. (Even suggesting that the science sector is also an interest group seems slightly heretical. It’s interesting that Dominic Cummings, for all his radicalism, seems to see little need for any reform of the science/research ecosystem beyond ARPA).\n\nFirst a general remark: I now see the current scientific (and cultural) establishment as having more implicit prizes than I used to realize.  In fact, getting a grant is one of the biggest prizes you can receive, if the grant is sufficiently prestigious.  By an “implicit prizes,” I mean a prize where the target achievement is not quite spelled out, but if “we” (however defined) judge you to have achieved enough, we will pour grants, status, and high quality social networks into your lap.  For instance, Alex and I have received significant “prizes” for writing MR, although none of those prizes have names or bring explicit public recognition, as opposed to general recognition.  We have in contrast never received a grant to write MR, so are prizes really so under-provided?\n\nSo my current thinking is a bit less “grants vs. prizes,” and somewhat more “implicit prizes vs. explicit prizes, each combined with grants to varying degrees.”  Implicit prizes are more flexible, but they also are easier to cheat with, since the standard of achievement is never quite clear.  Implicit prizes also are much more valuable to people who can use, build, and exploit their social networks, and of course that is not everyone (but shouldn’t we be giving more prizes to those people?).  Implicit prizes also can be revoked through subsequent loss of status.  Implicit prizes are more likely “granted” by the hands of social networks rather than judging panels, all of those features being both cost and benefit.\n\nNow to the specific points:\n\n1. As the venture capital ecosystem grows, and as the value of publicity rises (it is easier to monetize scientific and other sources of fame), and there are more “influencers in the broad sense,” there are more implicit prizes to be had.  And did the Lunar XPrize fail?  If an end is not worth accomplishing, a prize is one way to find that out.\n\n2. In addition to my point about the proliferation of implicit prizes, the scientific, academic, and political communities are far too conservative in the literal sense of that word.  How many top schools experiment with different tenure procedures?  Different ways of running a department?  It is sad how difficult it is to experiment with changes in academia and science, whether the topic be prizes or not.\n\n3. The best researchers get both grants and prizes (one hopes).\n\nBy the way, here is a recent piece on the empirics of prizes, mostly positive results.\n\nThe post How has my thinking on prizes vs. grants evolved? appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "What’s lost in the battle between Netflix and Disney+ is that most Americans are still spending much of their free time watching old-fashioned TV instead.\n\nThe average adult in the US spends about 27 hours per week watching traditional television (including live, on-demand, and DVR), according to Nielsen’s 2020 Total Audience Report. Only 19% of video consumption on TV sets in streaming-capable US homes is through a subscription streaming service, the report said. Nielsen did not breakdown the remaining 81% of TV usage, beyond saying it’s made up of a combination of traditional TV, watching DVDs, and playing video games.\n\nAmericans watched about three and a half hours of traditional TV per day, not including DVR or on-demand, in 2019 (down from three hours and 45 minutes in 2018). By comparison, they streamed only 38 minutes of content per day, though that was up from 29 minutes the prior year.\n\nThe prevalence of old-school TV watching through a cable or satellite provider (or via antennae) is mostly driven by older demographics. Americans 65-years and older still watch a whopping 46.5 hours of normal TV per week (vs. 4.6 hours of non-TV video consumption), while 18- to 34-year-olds only watch 11 hours of linear TV each week.\n\nThe older viewers gets, the more they tend to rely on traditional TV for their content. Likewise, younger Americans are much more likely to stream content on other devices. Eighteen to 34-year-olds watch three hours of content on their phones each week, while 65-and-ups watch just 49 minutes. The youngest adult demographic watches about the same amount of content on other devices as they do on TVs:\n\n \n\nThat’s why the “streaming wars” matter, even if streaming is not currently the predominant method of consuming content in the US. It probably will be soon.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, there were 646,152 “unique program titles” (read: TV series, movies, specials, and news programs) across all of American entertainment last year—up 10% from the year before. Many of these new titles are on streaming services.\n\nNinety-one percent of Americans in Nielsen’s survey of TV viewers said they subscribe to at least one streaming service. And 93% of that group said they are most likely to either increase or maintain their current number of subscriptions. Only 3% said they are planning to cut down on them.\n\nThe story is quite different for traditional TV. Virtually every major US cable or satellite provider is hemorrhaging subscribers. A 2018 report by eMarketer forecasted that by 2022, one fifth of Americans once subscribed to a traditional TV package will have cut the cord.\n\nLive and on-demand TV still represents a huge chunk of overall TV consumption—considerably bigger than that of streaming services like Netflix and Disney. But the days where that remains the case are numbered.\n",

Yahoo says if you had a Yahoo account anytime between 2012 and 2016 and are a resident of the US or Israel, the class action settlement may affect you.\n\nThe total amount of the settlement fund is $117.5 million, up from a proposed $50 million settlement that was rejected by a judge. Yahoo will use that settlement fund to pay for:\n\nA minimum of two years of credit monitoring for individual users\n\nA cash payment of $100 to users who can prove they already have at least 12 months of credit monitoring (though the final cash amount may be higher or lower depending on how many claims are filed)\n\nCompensation for time spent dealing with issues resulting from the data breaches\n\nOut-of-pocket costs users may have had to pay as a result of having their information stolen in the data breaches, such as paying an accountant to help refile a falsified tax return\n\nReimbursement for some costs of Yahoo’s premium or small business services\n\nIf you want to file a claim, you can find the forms right here. You must submit your claim online or by mail by July 20th.\n\nBut before you get too excited, just remember the Equifax situation; if a ton of people go through this process and opt for the cash payment, you’re not getting anything close to $100.\n\nIn addition to the 2013 breach that affected 3 billion Yahoo users, this proposed class action lawsuit also covers a 2014 “state-sponsored” hack that affected more than 500 million accounts, a 2012 “data security intrusion” (though Yahoo says there is no evidence that user credentials, email accounts, or contents of emails were taken from that), and a breach that lasted from 2015 to September 2016 where hackers were able to gain access to approximately 32 million Yahoo email accounts.\n",

          "description": "Within a relatively short timespan, historically speaking, China outpaced the U.S. in manufacturing--and paid a heavy environmental price. But now it appears they're addressing that issue, and are subsequently poised to dwarf us in another area. Surprisingly, that area is sustainability.\n\nNew policies laid out by China's National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment are determined to phase out single-use plastics, with an ambitious timeline that would be just about impossible in countries without totalitarian rule.\n\nOn the usage side:\n\n- Plastic bags will be banned in all major cities by the end of 2020\n\n- Single-use straws in restaurants will be banned by the end of 2020\n\nOn the production side:\n\n- Manufacturing/sale of plastic bags less than 0.025mm thick (i.e. shopping bags) banned by the end of 2020\n\n- Manufacturing/sale of plastic film less than 0.01mm thick (i.e. for agricultural use) banned by the end of 2020\n\n- Manufacturing/sale of disposable foam, plastic tableware and cotton-tipped swabs banned by the end of 2020\n\nPhoto by Magda Ehlers from Pexels\n\nAdditionally, the import of all plastic waste (apparently some was still sneaking through) is now completely banned.\n\nCities, which are where the majority of China's citizens (over 55%, according to the Associated Press) now live, will be hit the hardest. Towns and rural areas will have a bit longer to comply with the new rules, with their targets set for 2025.\n\nSo what about the massive amounts of plastic waste they've already got piled up? Reuters reports that \"China is already boosting recycling rates and is building dozens of 'comprehensive resource utilization' bases to ensure that more products are reused as part of its war on waste,\" although the Chinese government has not gone into specifics.\n\nChina is currently the world's #1 producer of plastic (according to CNN) and unsurprisingly, the world's #1 producer of plastic waste (according to the University of Oxford). For China to undertake such drastic steps to reverse, at least, the latter, is noteworthy enough that even difficult-to-please Greenpeace has re-Tweeted it.\n\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN, EcoWatch, Reuters, University of Oxford, Taipei Times\n",

          "description": "Jerry Taylor has made some positive noises about her on Twitter lately, as had Will Wilkinson in earlier times.  I genuinely do not see the appeal here, not even for Democrats.  Let’s do a quick survey of some of her core views:\n\n1. She wants to ban fracking through executive order.  This would enrich Russia and Saudi Arabia, harm the American economy ($3.5 trillion stock market gains from fracking), make our energy supply less green, and make our foreign policy more dependent on bad regimes and the Middle East.  It is perhaps the single worst policy idea I have heard this last year, and some of the worst possible politics for beating Trump in states such as Pennsylvania.\n\n2. Her private equity plan.  Making private equity managers personally responsible for the debts of the companies they acquire probably would crush the sector.  The economic evidence on private equity is mostly quite positive.  Maybe she would eliminate the worst features of her plan, but can you imagine her saying on open camera that private equity is mostly good for the American economy?  I can’t.\n\n3. Her farm plan.  It seems to be more nationalistic and protectionist and also more permanent than Trump’s, read here.\n\n4. Her tax plan I: Some of the wealthy would see marginal rates above 100 percent.\n\n5. Her tax plan II: Her proposed wealth tax would over time lead to rates of taxation on capital gains of at least 60 to 70 percent, much higher than any wealthy country ever has succeeded with.  And frankly no one has come close to rebutting the devastating critique from Larry Summers.\n\n6. Student debt forgiveness:  The data-driven people I know on the left all admit this is welfare for the relatively well-off, rather than a truly egalitarian approach to poverty and opportunity.  Cost is estimated at $1.6 trillion, by the way (is trillion the new billion?).  Furthermore, what are the long-run effects on the higher education sector?  Do banks lend like crazy next time around, expecting to be bailed out by the government?  Or do banks cut bank their lending, fearing a haircut on bailout number two?  I am genuinely not sure, but thinking the question through does not reassure me.\n\n7. College free for all: Would wreck the relatively high quality of America’s state-run colleges and universities, which cover about 78 percent of all U.S. students and are the envy of other countries worldwide and furthermore a major source of American soft power.  Makes sense only if you are a Caplanian on higher ed., and furthermore like student debt forgiveness this plan isn’t that egalitarian, as many of the neediest don’t finish high school, do not wish to start college, cannot finish college, or already reject near-free local options for higher education, typically involving community colleges.\n\n8. Health care policy: Her various takes on this, including the $52 trillion plan, are better thought of as (vacillating) political strategy than policy per se.  In any case, no matter what your view on health care policy she has botched it, and several other Dem candidates have a better track record in this area.  Even Paul Krugman insists that the Democrats should move away from single-payer purity.  It is hard to give her net positive points on this one, again no matter what your policy views on health care, or even no matter what her views may happen to be on a particular day.\n\nAll of my analysis, I should note, can be derived internal to Democratic Party economics, and it does not require any dose of libertarianism.\n\n9. Breaking up the Big Tech companies: I am strongly opposed to this, and I view it as yet another attack/destruction on a leading and innovative American sector.  I will say this, though: unlike the rest of the list above, I know smart economists (and tech experts) who favor some version of the policy.  Still, I don’t see why Jerry and Will should like this promise so much.\n\nThose are some pretty major sectors of the U.S. economy, it is not like making a few random mistakes with the regulation of toothpicks.  In fact they are the major sectors of the U.S. economy, and each and every one of them would take a big hit.\n\nMore generally, she seems to be a fan of instituting policies through executive order, a big minus in my view and probably for Jerry and Will as well?  Villainization and polarization are consistent themes in her rhetoric, and at this point it doesn’t seem her chances for either the nomination, or beating Trump, are strong in fact her conditional chance of victory is well below that of the other major Dem candidates.  So what really are you getting for all of these outbursts?\n\nWhen I add all that up, she seems to have the worst economic and political policies of any candidate in my adult lifetime, with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders (whose views are often less detailed).\n\nI do readily admit this: Warren is a genius at exciting the egalitarian and anti-business mood affiliation of our coastal media and academic elites.\n\nIf you would like to read defenses of Warren, here is Ezra Klein and here is Henry Farrell.  I think they both plausibly point to parts of the Warren program that might be good (more good for them than for me I should add, but still I can grasp the other arguments on her behalf).  They don’t much respond to the point that on #1-8, and possibly #1-9, she has the worst economic and political policies of any candidate in my adult lifetime.\n\nFor Jerry and Will, I just don’t see the attraction at all.\n\nThat said, on her foreign policy, which I have not spent much time with, she might be better, so of course you should consider the whole picture.  And quite possibly there are other candidates who, for other reasons, are worse yet, not hard to think of some.  Or you might wish to see a woman president.  Or you might think she would stir up “good discourse” on the issues you care about.  And I fully understand that most of the Warren agenda would not pass.\n\nSo I’m not trying to talk you out of supporting her!  Still, I would like to design and put into the public domain a small emoji, one that you could add to the bottom of your columns and tweets.  It would stand in for: “Yes I support her, but she has the worst proposed economic policies of any candidate in the adult lifetime of Tyler Cowen.”\n\nThe post The economic policy of Elizabeth Warren appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "Steve Bannon in Rome, Italy, on March 25, 2019. In an earlier interview with the journalist Michael Lewis, Bannon said, “The Democrats don’t matter, The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” | Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe impeachment trial probably won’t change any minds. Here’s why.\n\nNo matter how President Trump’s impeachment trial plays out in the Senate, one thing is certain: Despite the incontrovertible facts at the center of the story, the process will change very few minds.\n\nRegardless of how clear a case Democrats make, it seems likely that a majority of voters will remain confused and unsure about the details of Trump’s transgressions. No single version of the truth will be accepted.\n\nThis is a serious problem for our democratic culture. No amount of evidence, on virtually any topic, is likely to move public opinion one way or the other. We can attribute some of this to rank partisanship — some people simply refuse to acknowledge inconvenient facts about their own side.\n\nBut there’s another, equally vexing problem. We live in a media ecosystem that overwhelms people with information. Some of that information is accurate, some of it is bogus, and much of it is intentionally misleading. The result is a polity that has increasingly given up on finding out the truth. As Sabrina Tavernise and Aidan Gardiner put it in a New York Times piece, “people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake, and fact.” This is partly why an earth-shattering historical event like a president’s impeachment has done very little to move public opinion.\n\nThe core challenge we’re facing today is information saturation and a hackable media system. If you follow politics at all, you know how exhausting the environment is. The sheer volume of content, the dizzying number of narratives and counternarratives, and the pace of the news cycle are too much for anyone to process.\n\nOne response to this situation is to walk away and tune everything out. After all, it takes real effort to comb through the bullshit, and most people have busy lives and limited bandwidth. Another reaction is to retreat into tribal allegiances. There’s Team Liberal and Team Conservative, and pretty much everyone knows which side they’re on. So you stick to the places that feed you the information you most want to hear.\n\n Robert Alexander/Getty Images\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi reading totals of a vote approving articles of impeachment.\n\nMy Vox colleague Dave Roberts calls this an “epistemic crisis.” The foundation for shared truth, he argues, has collapsed. I don’t disagree with that, but I’d frame the problem a little differently.\n\nWe’re in an age of manufactured nihilism.\n\nThe issue for many people isn’t exactly a denial of truth as such. It’s more a growing weariness over the process of finding the truth at all. And that weariness leads more and more people to abandon the idea that the truth is knowable.\n\nI call this “manufactured” because it’s the consequence of a deliberate strategy. It was distilled almost perfectly by Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News and chief strategist for Donald Trump. “The Democrats don’t matter,” Bannon reportedly said in 2018. “The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.”\n\nThis idea isn’t new, but Bannon articulated it about as well as anyone can. The press ideally should sift fact from fiction and give the public the information it needs to make enlightened political choices. If you short-circuit that process by saturating the ecosystem with misinformation and overwhelm the media’s ability to mediate, then you can disrupt the democratic process.\n\nWhat we’re facing is a new form of propaganda that wasn’t really possible until the digital age. And it works not by creating a consensus around any particular narrative but by muddying the waters so that consensus isn’t achievable.\n\nBannon’s political objective is clear. As he explained in a 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference talk, he sees Trump as a stick of dynamite with which to blow up the status quo. So “flooding the zone” is a means to that end. But more generally, creating widespread cynicism about the truth and the institutions charged with unearthing it erodes the very foundation of liberal democracy. And the strategy is working.\n\nWhat flooding the zone actually means\n\nFor most of recent history, the goal of propaganda was to reinforce a consistent narrative. But zone-flooding takes a different approach: It seeks to disorient audiences with an avalanche of competing stories.\n\nAnd it produces a certain nihilism in which people are so skeptical about the possibility of finding the truth that they give up the search. The fact that 60 percent of Americans say they encounter conflicting reports about the same event is an example of what I mean. In the face of such confusion, it’s not surprising that less than half the country trusts what they read in the press.\n\nBannon articulated the zone-flooding philosophy well, but he did not invent it. In our time, it was pioneered by Vladimir Putin in post-Soviet Russia. Putin uses the media to engineer a fog of disinformation, producing just enough distrust to ensure that the public can never mobilize around a coherent narrative.\n\n Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears onscreen during a press conference in Moscow on December 19, 2019.\n\nIn October, I spoke to Peter Pomerantsev, a Soviet-born reality TV producer turned academic who wrote a book about Putin’s propaganda strategy. The goal, he told me, wasn’t to sell an ideology or a vision of the future; instead, it was to convince people that “the truth is unknowable” and that the only sensible choice is “to follow a strong leader.”\n\nOne major reason for the strategy’s success, both in the US and Russia, is that it coincided with a moment when the technological and political conditions were in place for it to thrive. Media fragmentation, the explosion of the internet, political polarization, curated timelines, and echo chambers — all of this allows a “flood the zone with shit” strategy to work.\n\nThe role of “gatekeeping” institutions has also changed significantly. Before the internet and social media, most people got their news from a handful of newspapers and TV networks. These institutions functioned like referees, calling out lies, fact-checking claims, and so on. And they had the ability to control the flow of information and set the terms of the conversation.\n\nToday, gatekeepers still matter in terms of setting a baseline for political knowledge, but there’s much more competition for clicks and audiences, and that alters the incentives for what’s declared newsworthy in the first place. At the same time, traditional media outlets remain committed to a set of norms that are ill adapted to the modern environment. The preference for objectivity in political coverage, in particular, is a problem.\n\nAs Joshua Green, who wrote a biography of Bannon, explained, Bannon’s lesson from the Clinton impeachment in the 1990s was that to shape the narrative, a story had to move beyond the right-wing echo chamber and into the mainstream media. That’s exactly what happened with the now-debunked Uranium One story that dogged Clinton from the beginning of her campaign — a story Bannon fed to the Times, knowing that the supposedly liberal paper would run with it because that’s what mainstream media news organizations do.\n\nIn this case, Bannon flooded the zone with a ridiculous story not necessarily to persuade the public that it was true (although surely plenty of people bought into it) but to create a cloud of corruption around Clinton. And the mainstream press, merely by reporting a story the way it always has, helped create that cloud.\n\nYou see this dynamic at work daily on cable news. Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway lies. She lies a lot. Yet CNN and MSNBC have shown zero hesitation in giving her a platform to lie because they see their job as giving government officials — even ones who lie — a platform.\n\nEven if CNN or MSNBC debunk Conway’s lies, the damage will be done. Fox and right-wing media will amplify her and other falsehoods; armies on social media, bot and real, will, too (@realDonaldTrump will no doubt chime in). The mainstream press will be a step behind in debunking — and even the act of debunking will serve to amplify the lies.\n\nUC Berkeley linguist George Lakoff calls this the “framing effect.” As Lakoff puts it, if you say “don’t think of an elephant,” you can’t help but think of an elephant. In other words, even if you reject an argument, merely repeating it cements the frame in people’s minds. Debunking it is still useful, of course, but there’s a cost to dignifying it in the first place.\n\nThere is some research that points to the utility of fact-checking. Political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler have shown that repeated exposure to fact-checking does tend to increase the accuracy of beliefs. But the issue with zone-flooding is an overabundance of news, which diminishes the importance of any individual story, no matter how big or damning.\n\nIn this environment, there are often too many things happening at once; it’s a constant game of whack-a-mole for journalists. And we know that false claims, if they’re repeated enough, become more plausible the more often they’re shared, something psychologists have called the “illusory truth” effect. Our brains, it turns out, tend to associate repetition with truthfulness. Some interesting new research, moreover, found that the more people encounter information the more likely they are to feel justified in spreading it, whether it’s true or not.\n\nFlooding the zone, polarization, and why many people still don’t know what Trump did\n\nThis all intersects with political polarization in troubling ways. One consequence of pervasive confusion about what’s happening is that people feel more comfortable siding with their political tribe. If everything’s up for grabs, and it’s hard to sift through the competing narratives to find the truth, then there’s nothing left but culture war politics. There’s “us” and “them,” and the possibility of persuasion is off the table.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this polarization is asymmetric. The left overwhelmingly receives its news from organizations like the New York Times, the Washington Post, or cable news networks like MSNBC or CNN. Some of the reporting is surely biased, and probably biased in favor of liberals, but it’s still (mostly) anchored to basic journalistic ethics.\n\nAs a recent book by three Harvard researchers explains, this just isn’t true of the right. American conservative media functions like a closed system, with Fox News at the center. Right-wing outlets are less tethered to conventional journalistic ethics and exist mostly to propagate the bullshit they produce.\n\nAll this has created an atmosphere that has helped Trump. The Trump administration has been remarkably successful at muddying the waters on Ukraine and impeachment, and Republicans in Congress have helped by parroting the administration’s talking points.\n\n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nReps. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Louie Gohmert (R-TX) look on as fellow Republicans speak to the press after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against President Trump on December 13, 2019.\n\nThe fact is, Trump did what Democrats have accused him of doing. We know, with absolute certainty, that the president tried to get a foreign government to investigate a family member of one of his political rivals. And we know this because of the witnesses who testified before the House Intelligence Committee and because Trump’s own White House released a record of the call proving it.\n\nYet all the polling data we have suggests that public opinion on Trump and Ukraine has basically held steady. Again, some of this is pure partisan recalcitrance. But there’s good reason to believe that the right’s muddying of the waters — making the story about Ukraine and Hunter Biden, pushing out conspiracy theories, repeatedly trumpeting Trump’s own version of events, etc. — has played a role.\n\nThe issue is that the coverage of the trials, in both the mainstream press and right-wing outlets, ensures that these counternarratives are part of the public conversation. It adds to the general atmosphere of doubt and confusion. And that’s why zone flooding presents a near-insoluble problem for the press.\n\nThe old model is broken\n\nThe way impeachment has played out underscores just how the new media ecosystem is a problem for our democracy.\n\nIt helps to think of zone-flooding less as a strategy deployed by a person or group and more as a natural consequence of the way media works.\n\nWe don’t need a master puppeteer pulling the media’s strings. The race for content, the need for clicks, is more than enough. Bannon or Conway can shake things up by feeding nonsense into the system.\n\n John Lamparski/Getty Images\n\nFox & Friends hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Pete Hegseth interview former US Army Lt. Clint Lorance on November 18, 2019.\n\nTrump can dictate an entire news cycle with a few unhinged tweets or an absurd press conference. The media cycle is easily commandeered by misinformation, innuendo, and outrageous content. These are problems because of the norms that govern journalism and because the political economy of media makes it very hard to ignore or dispel bullshit stories. This is at the root of our nihilism problem, and a solution is nowhere in sight.\n\nThe instinct of the mainstream press has always been to conquer lies by exposing them. But it’s just not that simple anymore (if it ever was). There are too many claims to debunk and too many conflicting narratives. And the decision to cover something is a decision to amplify it and, in some cases, normalize it.\n\nWe probably need a paradigm shift in how the press covers politics. Nearly all of the incentives driving media militate against this kind of rethinking, however. And so we’re likely stuck with this problem for a very long time.\n\nAs is often the case, the diagnosis is much easier than the cure. But liberal democracy cannot function without a shared understanding of reality. As long as the zone is flooded with shit, that shared understanding is impossible.\n",

          "description": "In order to drum up business for local movie theaters in Africa (most notably in Ghana), theater owners would commission local artists to paint movie posters.\n\nWhen Frank Armah began painting posters for Ghanaian movie theaters in the mid-1980s, he was given a clear mandate: Sell as many tickets as possible. If the movie was gory, the poster should be gorier (skulls, blood, skulls dripping blood). If it was sexy, make the poster sexier (breasts, lots of them, ideally at least watermelon-sized). And when in doubt, throw in a fish. Or don’t you remember the human-sized red fish lunging for James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me?\n\n“The goal was to get people excited, curious, to make them want to see more,” he says. And if the movie they saw ended up surprisingly light on man-eating fish and giant breasts? So be it. “Often we hadn’t even seen the movies, so these posters were based on our imaginations,” he says. “Sometimes the poster ended up speaking louder than the movie.”\n\nYou can check out more of these amazing artworks in this Twitter thread, this BBC story, on the AIGA site, and at Poster House, which has an exhibition of these posters up through Feb 16.\n\nUpdate: I removed this modern-day spoof of the Ghanaian posters from the post.

Cashnetusa.com comes to the conclusion that, while Game of Thrones paid out the big bucks and received the huge ratings, it isn’t always necessary. Peaky blinders received great reviews and spent 10 million less per episode!\n\nOur new guide to the cost of producing the best and worst rated shows on TV in 2019 reiterates this sense that it’s not always the size of your production budget that counts, but what you do with it. The costly robots of Westworld are rivalled in ratings by the non-union zombies of The Walking Dead for a third of the price; Lost In Space was just as mediocre as the decidedly more earthbound NCIS: New Orleans.\n\nAnd in the short-term, with the complete series rating hovering around 9.5 on IMDb, Game of Thrones still manages to top our new table as both the highest rated and highest costing show. But when you consider the bitter taste on the tongues of millions of disappointed HBO subscribers, would a more thought-through finale have been a better investment than all that extra cash? Or are GoT fans just sour because (as experts suggest) they’re going through an end-of-show ‘break-up’?\n\nThis infographic design does a lot of things right:\n\nGood scatterplot data visualization to illustrate their data\n\nData points are clearly identified with data titles using proximity, not connecting lines necessary.

          "description": "Hawaii is an amazing travel destination, and the best part is that if you’re American, you don’t need a passport to go there. It’s almost like visiting another country, but with a lot less hassle. However, from the mainland U.S., flights can be long and expensive.\n\nLuckily, there are easy and affordable ways to redeem miles and points earned with best credit cards for travel for award flights to Hawaii. Earning transferable points is a great way to start, because you’ll have many more options when it comes time to book your flights. This can help you get around blackout dates that some airlines impose or just general difficulty in finding available award seats.\n\nHawaii is an incredible destination you don’t want to miss! Here’s how to book award flights to Hawaii with your miles (Photo by Color Me Maui Photography/Shutterstock)\n\nHow to use transferable points for award flights to Hawaii\n\nTo give you options for your trip, we’ll cover flights to Hawaii and also flights within the Hawaiian Islands. We won’t cover every option available, but rather just the best and most useful.\n\nWe’ll cover the basics that will help you make an informed decision like:\n\nTransfer ratio: How many points do you need to transfer to get the number of miles you need?\n\nTransfer time: How long does it usually take to transfer your points to the airline? This is important because you don’t want to find an award only to see it disappear while you’re waiting for the miles to show up in your account.\n\nAward Prices: How many miles will it take to book a flight to Hawaii with a particular airline?\n\nPartner Award Prices: You can use most airline miles to book award flights on their partner airlines. However, typically airlines have different award charts for their partner airlines and partner award seats are usually harder to find because in many cases, you’ll only be able to book the lowest priced (i.e. Saver level) awards. Also, sometimes airlines don’t allow partner bookings for business or first-class seats.\n\nPros: What are the reasons you’d want to transfer points to an airline?\n\nCons: What are the downsides of transferring points to an airline?\n\nOther notes: If there are any special rules, tips, or ticks you should know for the airline, they’ll be covered here.\n\nHow to get to Hawaii with Chase Ultimate Rewards points\n\nYou can earn transferable Chase Ultimate Rewards points with the following cards:\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve®\n\nInk Business Preferred℠ Credit Card\n\nAnd the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn with the following no-annual-fee credit cards can be pooled onto the “premium” cards listed above, and then transferred to Chase’s travel partners:\n\nChase Freedom®\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited®\n\nInk Business Cash℠ Credit Card\n\nInk Business Unlimited℠ Credit Card\n\nBritish Airways\n\nBritish Airways operates a distance-based award chart, so the usefulness of British Airways Avios points depends on where in the U.S. you are starting from and whether you are taking a direct flight or a connecting flight. With British Airways, you pay based on the distance of each flight segment, not the total flight distance. So, short, non-stop flights can be a good deal, but longer flights and connecting flights generally aren’t.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: British Airways does not fly to Hawaii, so you’ll need to use the partner award chart below.\n\nPartner Award Prices: British Airways operates a distance-based award chart. You can use the Great Circle Mapper to estimate the distance of each segment of your flight. Most partner flights from the U.S. to Hawaii will fall into the 2,001-3,000 miles range and cost 13,000 Avios points. You’ll want to focus on flights offered by American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, both British Airways partners.\n\nBritish Airways Avios points are going to make the most sense for those of you that are taking a direct flight to Hawaii from the West Coast. If you add a connecting flight you’ll pay for each segment separately. A few examples of the flights that you’ll want to focus on if you want to redeem your British Airways Avios are:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) – Honolulu (HNL)\n\nOakland (OAK) – Honolulu (HNL)\n\nPhoenix (PHX) – Honolulu (HNL)\n\nSacramento (SMF) – Honolulu (HNL)\n\nSeattle (SEA) – Honolulu (HNL)\n\nPros: Great for booking direct flights from the West Coast\n\nCons: Not good for folks who can’t fly nonstop or are flying from the East Coast\n\nOther notes:\n\nFor more tips check out our complete guide to British Airways Avios points\n\nFlying Blue (Air France / KLM)\n\nFlying Blue is the rewards program of both Air France and KLM, and you can use Flying Blue miles to book travel to Hawaii on Delta.\n\nTransfer Ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer Time: Instant\n\nAward Prices:\n\nFlying Blue doesn’t publish an award chart anymore. Rather, they offer a pricing calculator. Unfortunately, the pricing calculator page often redirects to the home page, so for your reference, the following prices are typically the lowest available:\n\nCoach – 30,000 Flying Blue miles round-trip\n\nBusiness Class – 60,000 Flying Blue miles round-trip\n\nPros: Even though the Flying Blue price calculator can be hit or miss, their award search engine does a pretty good job. The award calendar is a great bonus.\n\nCons: Can be tough to find available award seats on Delta, especially if you need to connect in the contiguous U.S.\n\nIberia\n\nIberia operates a distance-based award chart, just like British Airways and you can even transfer Avios points between your Iberia & British Airways account. But you’ll have to jump through a few hoops to do it.\n\nIberia is a member of the oneworld alliance, so you’ll be able to book partner awards flights with American Airlines to get to Hawaii. Keep in mind, Iberia only allows you to book round-trip flights on partners like American Airlines, not one-way tickets.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Here’s the Iberia award chart for American Airlines flights:\n\nOne advantage of using Iberia Avios points instead of British Airways Avios points is that Iberia charges you based on the total distance traveled instead of by segment. So if you have a connection you could potentially pay fewer miles.\n\nThat said, their pricing to Hawaii from the West Coast isn’t as good as British Airways. For example, a round-trip flight between Los Angeles and Maui has a total flight distance of ~4,970 miles, which puts it just inside the band for 28,000 Iberia Avios points in coach.  That’s 2,000 points more than what you’d pay with British Airways Avios points on the same route.\n\nBut looking at Los Angeles to Honolulu, the total flight distance is ~5,112 miles round-trip, so would cost 42,000 Iberia Avios points in coach. That’s not nearly as good a deal.\n\nPros: You’ll be charged for the total distance flown, not by segment.\n\nCons: Can be pricey especially from the East Coast due to distance-based award chart.  Only round-trip awards are permitted on American Airlines.\n\nOther Notes: You can book American Airlines partner awards online.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Singapore Airlines miles is how easy they are to earn. You can transfer points to Singapore Airlines from Citi ThankYou, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One and Marriott. So if you don’t have enough flexible points to get to Hawaii in any single program, you can easily combine points together and book award flights with Singapore Airlines miles.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Up to two days\n\nAward Prices: Singapore Airlines offers the cheapest award prices for booking award flights on United Airlines to Hawaii.\n\nCoach – 35,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nBusiness Class – 60,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nOne-way partner awards are half the price of the round-trip partner awards.\n\nPros: Some of the easiest airline miles to earn as they transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, Capital One and Marriott.\n\nCons: Not the cheapest deal for flights from the West Coast.\n\nSouthwest\n\nSouthwest just began flights to Hawaii in early 2019. That’s great news for anyone with a Southwest Companion Pass, because they’ll get to take a friend or family member to Hawaii as often as they want for just the price of taxes & fees. You can transfer both Marriott points (3:1 ratio) and Chase Ultimate Rewards to Southwest, so they’re pretty easy to collect.\n\nThere are also plenty of Chase credit cards that come with  Southwest points, so they’re even easier to collect:\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card \n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Southwest is unique to these other airlines in that they don’t have an award chart. The award prices they charge are directly proportional to the cash price of the ticket. And you’ll generally receive a value of ~1.5 cents per point.\n\nFor example, the below flight from Chicago to San Jose, California, costs $175.\n\nThe same exact seat costs 10,957 Southwest points + $5.60 in taxes. That’s a value of 1.54 cents each.\n\nPros: When Southwest flights go on sale, their award prices drop, too. That’s the benefit of award prices being tied directly to cash prices. Also, Southwest is great for booking cheap inter-island flights.\n\nCons: There are no business or first-class awards on Southwest. So if you’re averse to flying long distances in coach, this isn’t the airline for you.\n\nOther notes: Seriously, you should look into earning the Southwest Companion Pass. It’s the best airline perk because it lets a friend or family member travel with you for free whenever you travel on Southwest. It doesn’t matter if your flight is booked with points or paid for with cash – your companion flies for just the cost of taxes and fees as long as Southwest is selling seats on that flight.\n\nCheck out this Southwest Companion Pass post for all you need to know.\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines prices their awards as “Saver” awards and “Everyday” awards. Saver awards are much cheaper, so those are what you’ll want to find and book.  Everyday awards can be absurdly expensive and are typically not a good deal. The problem is that United no longer has an official award chart and instead prices awards dynamically. So the prices we’ve listed here follow the old award chart and can vary widely.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: For flights from the contiguous U.S. to the Hawaiian islands, you’ll pay:\n\nCoach – 22,500 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 45,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nBusiness Class – 40,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 90,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nFirst Class – 50,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 110,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nIf you want to visit a couple of different islands on your trip, redeeming United Airlines miles is a great choice for inter-island flights on partner Hawaiian Airlines. You’ll pay the following prices:\n\nCoach – 7,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 14,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nBusiness Class – 9,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 18,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award.\n\nPros: United Airlines awards are easy to find and book and typically there are lots of available award seats. United Airlines miles are also a great option if you want to fly between the Hawaiian islands during your trip.\n\nCons: business & first-class awards and Everyday Awards are expensive for travel to Hawaii and with dynamic pricing you can’t rely on finding consistent award prices.\n\nOther notes:\n\nUnited Airlines allows a free stopover or a free one-way on round-trip award flights in the form of the “United Airlines Excursionist Perk” \n\nIf you have one of the Chase United Airlines credit cards or United Airlines elite status, you’ll have access to more available award seats!\n\nFor more on how to book awards with United Airlines miles check out our Ultimate Guide to United Airlines Miles!\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic miles are another great way to book Delta flights if they have the available award seats you need. Better yet, you can use your Virgin Atlantic miles for flights on Hawaiian Airlines too.\n\nBut, you can’t fly both Delta and Hawaiian airlines on the same award ticket, only one partner is allowed. Virgin Atlantic miles also transfer from other major transferable points currencies like Amex Membership Rewards and Citi ThankYou points, so even if you don’t have enough Chase Ultimate Rewards points, you may be able to combine points for your flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: For flights from the contiguous U.S. to Hawaii, you’re looking at 40,000 Virgin Atlantic miles for a round-trip flight in coach, or 75,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in first-class if you want to fly Delta.\n\nDepending on where you are flying from, flying Hawaiian Airlines may not be as good of a price. Flights from the West Coast to Hawaii start at the same 40,000 miles in coach and 80,000 miles in business class. But, if you want to fly from the East Coast on Hawaiian Airlines, you’re looking at 80,000 miles in coach and 130,000 miles in business class. Flights from the East Coast on Hawaiian Airlines probably shouldn’t be booked with Virgin Atlantic miles.\n\nYou can book flights between the Hawaiian Islands on Hawaiian Airlines for 15,000 miles round-trip in coach and 30,000 miles round-trip in business class.\n\nOne-way bookings are permitted.\n\nFuel Surcharges: Not something you need to worry about on flights to Hawaii.\n\nPros: Can book flights on Delta and Hawaiian Airlines, sometimes more Delta award availability\n\nCons: High prices for flights on Hawaiian Airlines from the East Coast.\n\nOther notes:\n\nOne way bookings are permitted\n\nWhen to book through the Chase travel portal instead\n\nDepending on how much your plane tickets cost, it doesn’t always make sense to transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners for award flights. Instead, you might save points by booking a cheap fare through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal.\n\nWhether or not it makes sense to book through Chase Travel will depend on a few things: How much the ticket costs, what transfer partner you would be using, and which Chase card(s) you have.\n\nLet’s start out with which Chase credit cards you have. Here’s what your points are worth through the portal with each Chase Ultimate Rewards card:\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards Card\n\nHow Much Are Points Worth Toward Travel?\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\n\n1.5 cents\n\nInk Business Preferred Credit Card\n\n1.25 cents\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Card\n\n1.25 cents\n\nInk Business Cash Credit Card\n\n1 cent\n\nInk Business Unlimited Credit Card\n\n1 cent\n\nChase Freedom\n\n1 cent\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\n1 cent\n\nGenerally, the cheaper your plane ticket is, the more likely it makes sense to redeem points through Chase travel instead of through a transfer partner.\n\nLet’s look at a quick example first. Suppose you were going to transfer miles to United Airlines to book a coach ticket. United Airlines charges at least 45,000 miles to fly to Hawaii and back in coach. You would be better off redeeming through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal if your ticket cost less than the following:\n\nWith the Chase Sapphire Reserve: $675\n\nWith the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink Business Preferred:  ~$563\n\nWith other Chase cards: $450\n\nDepending on what miles you are using, these numbers wouldn’t necessarily be the same. To find out what the breakeven price would be, take the numbers required and multiply by the value of your Chase points. For example, 45,000 United Airlines miles X 0.015 (for the Chase Sapphire Reserve) = $675.\n\nLooked at another way, let’s say that your round-trip flight to Hawaii was going to cost $475. This is how many points you would pay if you booked through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal:\n\nWith the Sapphire Reserve: ~31,667 Chase Ultimate Rewards points\n\nWith the Sapphire Preferred or Ink Business Preferred: 38,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points\n\nWith other Chase cards: 47,500 Chase Ultimate Rewards points\n\nIn this case, you would be better off booking through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred, or Chase Ink Business Preferred compared to transferring and paying 45,000 United Airlines miles for an award ticket.\n\nOf course, if your alternative is booking with British Airways Avios points, that completely changes the equation. If you could book an award flight from Phoenix to Honolulu for 26,000 British Airways Avios points round-trip, you would be better off doing that no matter what card you have assuming a ticket price of $475.\n\nTo find out how many points you need for a given ticket price when booked through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal, take the ticket price and divide by the value of your Chase points depending on what Chase card you have.\n\nTwo other benefits to redeeming your points through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal is that you don’t have to worry about finding available award seats or blackout dates. As long as there’s a seat available for sale, you will be able to book it, and you’ll also earn frequent flyer miles and credit toward status for your airline ticket.\n\nHow to get to Hawaii with American Express Membership Rewards points\n\nAmex Membership Rewards points are very helpful for getting to Hawaii because they have lots of useful airline transfer partners and they are easy to earn. Even better is that Amex Membership Rewards points offer frequent transfer bonuses to their partner airlines, so you can get even more value out of your points.\n\nYou can earn transferable Amex Membership Rewards points with these cards:\n\nCard\n\nWelcome bonus & minimum spending requirements\n\nThe Business Platinum® Card from American Express\n\nEarn up to 75,000 Amex Membership Rewards® points: 50,000 points after you spend $10,000 and an extra 25,000 points after you spend an additional $10,000 all on qualifying purchases made on the card within the first 3 months of account opening.\nTerms Apply.\n\nAmerican Express®️ Green Card\n\nReceive up to $100 in statement credits toward any eligible purchase from Away made within the first three months of Card Membership.

Terms Apply.\n\nThe information for the Amex EveryDay Preferred Credit Card and Amex EveryDay Credit Card has been collected independently by Million Mile Secrets. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nIf you’re working with only Amex Membership Rewards points, you have a lot of great options for flights to Hawaii.\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan is part of the Star Alliance, so is useful for redemptions on Star Alliance member United Airlines for flights to Hawaii. Aeroplan doesn’t have the best award prices to Hawaii, but they are still a good option if you want to fly United Airlines, especially if there is a transfer bonus.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: A round-trip flight to Hawaii costs 45,000 Aeroplan miles in coach, 80,000 Aeroplan miles in Business Class, and 110,000 Aeroplan miles in first class. One-way awards cost half of what a round-trip award costs.\n\nPros: Frequent transfer bonuses\n\nCons: Not the best award prices to Hawaii\n\nOther notes:\n\nReasonable lap infant fees – $50 to $125 or 5,000 to 12,500 Aeroplan miles\n\nFor more tips check out our guide to using Aeroplan miles\n\nANA\n\nYou can redeem ANA (All Nippon Airways) miles to book flights on United Airlines, just like Air Canada. ANA offers lower prices for the same flights as Air Canada in both coach and Business Class. If you want to fly first class, you’ll get a better deal with Air Canada, so it won’t usually make sense to use ANA to book first-class flights to Hawaii. Unfortunately, ANA does not allow one-way bookings, so if you want to book one-way flights, you’ll need to turn elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks to using ANA miles are that the award chart and routing rules are relatively complicated.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Two to three days\n\nAward Prices: As mentioned, ANA’s first class price isn’t great, but they’re a good option for coach and business-class flights to Hawaii. ANA charges 40,000 miles round-trip for coach flights, 68,000 miles round-trip for Business Class flights, and 120,000 miles round-trip for First Class flights. One-way flight bookings are not possible with ANA miles.\n\nIn the chart below, Y is coach, C is Business Class, and F is First Class.\n\nPros: Cheaper prices for coach tickets that booking with Air Canada\n\nCons: Business and first-class flights to Hawaii are expensive and you must book round-trip award flights\n\nOther notes:\n\nANA miles expire after 36 months and cannot be extended\n\nBritish Airways\n\nIt’s not uncommon for there to be an Amex Membership Rewards transfer bonus to British Airways and they can be quite generous, which could make British Airways a useful option, especially if you have your eye on a direct flight from the West Coast.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nFor more details on using British Airways Avios points to get to Hawaii, check the Chase Ultimate Rewards points section.\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles\n\nCathay Pacific operates a distance-based award chart and they are a member of the oneworld alliance, which includes American Airlines. Cathay Pacific is also a partner of Alaska Airlines, so you can fly Alaska Airlines to get to Hawaii as well.\n\nCathay Pacific does have good prices for certain flights to Hawaii, but understanding their award chart and booking rules will take some work and booking awards can present some challenges too. One good thing about Cathay Pacific is that they are transfer partners of most flexible points programs, so it might be easier to accumulate the miles you need.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: One to two days\n\nAward Prices: As mentioned, Cathay Pacific Asia Miles has a distance-based award chart. In fact, they have a couple of different distance-based award charts.Generally their prices for shorter flights are better than for longer flights. Flights that fall into the Ultra-Short and Short categories are the only ones that will really make sense to book.\n\nHere is the Cathay Pacific Asia Miles award chart for flights on Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon. Unfortunately, you won’t exactly see these prices when looking at flights to Hawaii. That’s because flights on a single partner airline cost 5,000 more miles for a one-way flight, but Cathay Pacific does not publish their partner award chart anymore.\n\nFor example, a flight on Cathay Pacific that falls into the “Short” category in coach would cost 10,000 Asia Miles. If a flight of the same length is on a partner airline, like American Airlines, it would cost 15,000 Asia Miles.\n\nThat means that Ultra-Short flights on a partner cost more than British Airways would charge for the same flight (but no flights to Hawaii are this short anyway).  And British Airways would charge less for Short flights (on a partner) as well. Because Asia Miles is more complicated than British Airways, if you don’t need to connect, using British Airways Avios points is going to be a better bet.\n\nHowever, if you need to make a connection, you might be better off redeeming Cathay Pacific Asia Miles. This is because British Airways charges for each flight segment separately, but Cathay Pacific charges for the entire one-way flight distance.\n\nYou can use Great Circle Mapper to find out the approximate distance of your flight, and make sure to include any connections. There aren’t that many flight options from the U.S. to Hawaii that are going to fall into that 1,151 to 2,750 mileage band, however, but here are a few examples:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) – Honolulu (HNL):  2,556 miles each way\n\nSan Francisco (SFO) – Honolulu (HNL):  2,398 miles each way\n\nSacramento (SMF) – San Francisco (SFO) – Honolulu (HNL):  2,484 miles each way\n\nAll of these flight itineraries fall into the “Short” flight category, but only the flight from Sacramento to Honolulu with a connection in San Francisco would be a better use of Asia Miles than British Airways Avios points.\n\nFlights that are longer than 2,750 miles would fall into the medium category and generally wouldn’t be a great use of Asia Miles unless they were the only option.\n\nWhen booking an Asia Miles Standard Award, one-way bookings are permitted. Additionally, a Standard Award round-trip award flight can have up to three stopovers and one open-jaw, but the rules are complicated and this doesn’t apply to all award flights. You can read more about the stopover and open-jaw rules under #5 in the terms.\n\nThis award chart only applies to award bookings which include only one partner airline or one partner airline and Cathay Pacific or Cathay Dragon. This will have you covered for flights to Hawaii, but for flights to other regions you may have to check out Cathay Pacific’s oneworld multi-carrier award chart.\n\nPros: Easy to earn – they transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, and Marriott, useful for short-haul or one-way awards, potentially generous stopover and open-jaw policy\n\nCons: Overly complicated, expensive for longer flights, and many partners can’t be booked online\n\nOther notes:\n\nYou can book award flights online if you’re flying on Cathay Pacific, Cathay Dragon, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Qantas, or Qatar Airways.  But for awards which include any other partner airline, including American Airlines flights to Hawaii, you’ll need to fill out a “Flight Award Request Form“ or call 866-892-2598 to book your award\n\nUse this tool to figure out how much a specific award flight will cost\n\nSometimes you’ll get a phone agent that doesn’t completely understand Cathay Pacific’s convoluted award booking rules. Don’t be afraid to hang up and call again.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta no longer publishes an official award chart. So it’s a bit of a guessing game estimating how many Delta miles it will cost to get to Hawaii. Nevertheless, Delta miles are worth considering if you want to fly Delta to Hawaii.\n\nAdditionally, Delta does have frequent award flight sales, and they could include flights to Hawaii. This is a good option to keep in your mind in case a good deal pops up.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Delta doesn’t publish an award chart anymore, but in general, you’ll be able to find award flights for as low as 22,500 Delta miles one-way in coach and 40,000 Delta miles one-way in Business Class. Delta occasionally has award flash sales where prices can be even lower than this. It’s also not uncommon to see much higher prices.\n\nFuel Surcharges: Yes, but not something you need to worry about on flights to Hawaii\n\nPros: Potentially useful award sales\n\nCons: No award chart\n\nOther notes:\n\nWhen you transfer Amex points to U.S. based carriers like Delta, you’ll be charged a small fee of 0.06 cents per point up to a maximum of $99. For example, if you transfer 45,000 Amex points to Delta, you’ll be charged a fee of $27.\n\nFlying Blue (Air France/KLM)\n\nAmex has offered transfer bonuses to Flying Blue in the past, which can make Flying Blue an even better option for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nFor more information on using Flying Blue miles to get to Hawaii, check out the Chase Ultimate Rewards section.\n\nIberia\n\nIberia operates a distance-based award chart, just like British Airways.  You can even transfer your Avios points between your Iberia and British Airways accounts, but you’ll have to jump through a few hoops to do it.\n\nIberia is a member of the oneworld alliance, so you’ll be able to book partner award flights with American Airlines for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: One to two days\n\nSee the Iberia notes under the Chase Ultimate Rewards section for more details.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines is a great option for flights to Hawaii and they are easy to earn!  You can transfer points from Citi ThankYou, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One and Marriott to Singapore Airlines.  If you don’t have enough points with any one program, you can pool your points easily with Singapore Airlines miles!\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Up to 24 hours\n\nSee the Singapore Airlines notes under the Chase Ultimate Rewards section for more details.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic miles are a good option for flights to Hawaii.  Like Singapore Airlines miles, you can transfer to Virgin Atlantic from Citi ThankYou, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards and Marriott, so you have an opportunity to combine your miles if you need to. Additionally, Virgin Atlantic sometimes has access to more Delta award seats than other airline partners do, so they’re worth a look even if you don’t think there are available award seats.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nFor more information, see the Virgin Atlantic information under the Chase Ultimate Rewards section.\n\nWhen to book through the Amex travel portal instead\n\nDepending on how much your plane tickets cost, it doesn’t always make sense to transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to airline partners for award flights. Instead, you might save points by booking a cheap fare through Amex Travel.\n\nWhether or not it makes sense to book through Amex Travel will depend on a couple of things: How much the ticket costs, what transfer partner you would be using, and possibly on what Amex card you have.\n\nFor the most part, the Amex card that you have won’t make a difference as to how much your points are worth. For most cards, your Membership Rewards points are worth just one cent each when redeemed for airfare but, there’s one exception.\n\nIf you have The Business Platinum® Card from American Express, you’ll get 35% of your redeemed points back in two cases: If you’re booking business or first-class airfare on any airline through Amextravel.com, and if you’re booking coach on your airline of choice (the same airline that you’ve chosen to get the $200 airline fee credit reimbursement from). In these cases, your Amex points are worth ~1.54 cents each when you factor in the rebate.\n\nGenerally, the cheaper your plane ticket is, the more likely it makes sense to redeem points through Amex Travel instead of through a transfer partner, but the scale doesn’t tip as easily as it does for some Chase cards.\n\nFor example, let’s assume that you are considering transferring Amex points to Delta to book a coach ticket. Delta charges 45,000 miles for a low-level award flight to Hawaii and back in coach. Your breakeven price between transferring to Delta or using points as cash would be the following:\n\nWith most Amex cards: 45,000 Delta miles X 0.01 = $450\n\nWith the Business Platinum Card from American Express and Delta chosen as your airline: 45,000 Delta miles X ~0.0154 = ~$693\n\nIf your flight price is less than the price listed above (for this example), it would cost less for you to redeem your Amex points as cash through American Express Travel instead of transferring to Delta.\n\nDepending on what miles you are using, these numbers wouldn’t necessarily be the same. To find out what the breakeven price would be, take the numbers required and multiply by the value of your Amex points. Looked at another way, let’s say that your round-trip coach flight to Hawaii was going to cost $400 on Delta. This is how many points you would pay if you booked through Amex Travel:\n\nWith most Amex cards: 40,000 Amex Membership Rewards points ($400 / 0.01)\n\nWith the Business Platinum Card from American Express and Delta chosen as your airline: ~26,000 Amex Membership Rewards points (Simply: $400 / 0.0154 = ~26,000, or to get the exact amount: $400 / 0.01 = 40,000; 40,000 – (40,000 X 0.35 Rebate) = 26,000 miles)\n\nIn this case, you would be better off booking through Amex Travel with your Amex points rather than transferring 45,000 Delta Airlines miles for an award ticket no matter which Amex card you have. If our example flight had been more expensive, that may not have been the case.\n\nYou’ll need the full number of Amex Membership Rewards points in your account (in this case, 40,000 points) to book the ticket. You’ll receive the 35% rebate from having the Amex Business Platinum card in 8-10 weeks.\n\nTo find out how many points you need for a given ticket price when booked through Amex Travel, take the ticket price and divide by the value of your Amex points.\n\nTwo other benefits to redeeming your points through Amex travel is that you don’t have to worry about finding available award seats or blackout dates. As long as there’s a seat available for sale, you will be able to book it, and you’ll also earn frequent flyer miles and credit toward status for your airline ticket.\n\nHow to get to Hawaii with Citi ThankYou points\n\nCiti ThankYou points are another great option if you want to book award flights to Hawaii. Like Chase Ultimate Rewards and Membership Rewards points, they have a number of useful airline transfer partners (and some of the partners even overlap). You can earn Citi ThankYou points from cards like the Citi Premier℠ Card or Citi Prestige® Card.\n\nInformation for the Citi Premier and Citi Prestige cards has been collected independently by Million Mile Secrets and has not been reviewed by the card issuer.\n\nAvianca LifeMiles\n\nLifeMiles is the mileage program for Star Alliance member Avianca, and has made headlines in the past for miscategorizing airport codes into different regions. This has led to some incredible redemptions, but there’s nothing sneaky you can do for Hawaii flights. That said, Avianca’s rates are still pretty good for travel from the U.S. to Hawaii.\n\nBecause United Airlines is also part of Star Alliance, you can redeem Avianca miles for travel on United Airlines.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Avianca splits the U.S. up into multiple regions: United States 1, United States 2, and United States 3, plus Hawaii. However, for flights between the U.S. and Hawaii, it doesn’t matter where you are flying from or to. The prices are the same. If you want to fly in coach (X), it costs 22,500 Avianca miles each way, Business Class (I) costs 40,000 Avianca miles each way, and First Class (O) costs 50,000 Avianca miles each way.\n\nThe business and first-class prices are not great with Avianca, but the coach price isn’t bad.\n\nPros: Average coach prices for flights to Hawaii\n\nCons: High award prices for Business and First Class\n\nOther notes: Avianca charges a $25 fee for all award bookings\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles is also a transfer partner of Amex Membership Rewards points.  They operate on a distance based award chart, and are a reasonable option for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   Instant\n\nFor more information on using Asia Miles to get to Hawaii, check out the Amex Membership Rewards section of this post.\n\nEtihad\n\nEtihad has different award prices for each partner, which can make things pretty complicated. Luckily, if you’re considering using Etihad miles to get to Hawaii, there’s only one partner that you care about – American Airlines.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Etihad’s award prices between the U.S. and Hawaii aren’t bad, but they’re not great either. Business and first-class awards are quite expensive, but don’t cost as much as some other airlines charge. Coach prices are average to good, especially during the off-peak travel time. Etihad considers off-peak for Hawaii to be January 12 to March 8, August 22, and December 15. So, you’re not really getting a ton of options for travel during off-peak dates.\n\nSomething that is intriguing is the inter-island Hawaii price at only 5,000 Etihad miles. However, American Airlines doesn’t operate any inter-island Hawaii flights, so it doesn’t seem possible to actually book a flight for that price, but if American Airlines ever offers flights between the islands it could offer a good opportunity to redeem some Etihad miles.\n\nPros: Reasonable coach and coach off-peak award prices\n\nCons: Not many off-peak travel dates, high business and first-class award prices\n\nOther notes: If American Airlines ever starts operating flights between the Hawaiian Islands, the price Etihad charges for inter-island flights is pretty good (but don’t hold your breath)\n\nFlying Blue (KLM/Air France)\n\nFlying Blue is a transfer partner of all of the major transferable point currencies, and is a good option for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nTo find out more about using Flying Blue miles to get to Hawaii, reference the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nQantas\n\nQantas isn’t a bad program to work with, and they have a really good award search engine. Their prices for flights to Hawaii, in the right circumstances, aren’t bad either.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nAward Prices: Qantas has a distance based award chart. If you’re flying from the U.S. to Hawaii, most flights are going to be around 2,500 to 5,500 miles in length each way, depending on where in the U.S. you are flying from and how many connections you need to make. This means that your one-way flights are likely going to fall into Zone 4, 5, or 6.\n\nOnly Zone 4 pricing is really worth considering, and even then, only in coach. In most cases, using British Airways Avios points is going to cost fewer points than Qantas if you are flying from the West Coast, but if you are making a connecting flight it could make sense to book with Qantas instead.\n\nYou can check the approximate distance of your flights on gcmap.com and compare the cost of booking with Qantas and booking with British Airways if you want to fly American Airlines.\n\nFor example, here are some one way flight distances to Hawaii:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) – Honolulu (HNL):  2,556 miles one way\n\nPhoenix (PHX) – Honolulu (HNL):  2,917 miles one way\n\nDallas (DFW) – Honolulu (HNL):  3,784 miles one way\n\nAlbuquerque (ABQ) – Phoenix (PHX) – Honolulu (HNL):  3,246 miles one way\n\nPros: Great award search engine, okay award price in coach, in certain circumstances (for example, a connecting flight on American Airlines where the first leg is relatively short like the last example shown above)\n\nCons: High prices for business class and first class\n\nSingapore Krisflyer\n\nSingapore Airlines is a transfer partner of all of the major transferable point currencies and offers great prices for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nTo find out more about using Singapore Airlines miles to fly to Hawaii, refer to the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic is a transfer partner of all of the major transferable point currencies. They sometimes have access to more Delta award seats than other partners, so they may be worth a look if you’re coming up short elsewhere!\n\nTransfer ratio: 1:1\n\nTransfer time: Instant\n\nFor more information on using Virgin Atlantic miles to fly to Hawaii, refer to the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nWhen to book through the Citi ThankYou travel portal instead\n\nDepending on how much your plane ticket costs, it doesn’t always make sense to transfer Citi ThankYou Points to airline partners for award flights. Instead, you might save points by booking a cheap fare through the Citi ThankYou travel portal (and earn miles when you fly).\n\nWhether or not it makes sense to book through the Citi ThankYou Travel Portal will depend on a couple of things: How much the ticket costs, what transfer partner you would be using (and the points cost of your potential award ticket), and which Citibank credit cards you have.\n\nLet’s start out with which Citi card you have. Things are simpler here than for Chase and Amex. If you have the Citi Premier Card, your ThankYou points are worth 1.25 cents each towards airfare. If you have any other card that earns Citi ThankYou points, your points are worth one cent each.\n\nGenerally, the cheaper your plane ticket is, the more likely it makes sense to redeem points through the Citi ThankYou Travel Portal instead of through a transfer partner.\n\nLet’s look at a quick example first. Suppose you were going to transfer miles to Etihad to book an off-peak, round-trip coach ticket. Etihad would charge 35,000 miles for this ticket. You would be better off redeeming through the Citi Travel Center if your ticket cost less than the following:\n\nWith the Citi Prestige or Citi Premier: $437.50 (35,000 X 0.0125)\n\nWith other Citi cards: $350 (35,000 X 0.01)\n\nDepending on what miles you are using, these numbers wouldn’t necessarily be the same. To find out what the breakeven price would be, take the number of miles required and multiply by the value of your Citi points. For example, 35,000 Etihad miles X 0.0125 (for the Citi Prestige or Citi Premier) = $437.50.\n\nLooked at another way, let’s say that your round-trip flight to Hawaii was going to cost $375. This is how many points you would pay if you booked through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal:\n\nWith the Citi Prestige or Citi Premier:  30,000 Citi ThankYou points ($375 / 0.0125)\n\nWith other Citi cards:  37,500 Citi ThankYou points ($375 / 0.01)\n\nIn this case, you would be better off booking through the Citi Travel Portal if you have the Citi Premier, compared to transferring and paying 35,000 Etihad miles for an award ticket. If you have other Citi cards, it would still cost less to transfer.\n\nTwo other benefits to redeeming your points through the Citi ThankYou Travel Portal is that you don’t have to worry about finding available award seats or blackout dates. As long as there’s a seat available for sale, you will be able to book it, and you’ll also earn frequent flyer miles and credit toward status for your airline ticket.\n\nHow to get to Hawaii with Marriott Bonvoy points\n\nThere are a ton of airline partners available if you have Marriott points — over 40. We won’t go into details about how to fly to Hawaii with every single possible partner. Instead, we’ll just tell you the best Marriott transfer partners to get you to Hawaii. Here’s our guide to transferring Marriott points to airlines.\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan\n\nMarriott points aren’t your only option for transferring to Air Canada Aeroplan. You can also transfer American Express Membership Rewards points.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~5 days\n\nTo find out more about using your Air Canada Aeroplan miles to get to Hawaii, check out the Amex Membership Rewards section.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAlaska Airlines miles are a good option for getting to Hawaii on Alaska Airlines and an okay option for traveling to Hawaii on American Airlines. Unfortunately, Alaska Airlines isn’t a partner of any other transferable point currency, so they’re a little bit harder to earn than some of the other options. Nevertheless, it may be the best way for you to get to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~2 days\n\nAward Prices: Alaska Airlines charges different award prices for each partner. So, depending on if you want to fly on American Airlines or Alaska Airlines, you’ll have to look at different award charts and pricing.\n\nAlaska Airlines charges the following prices for their own flights:\n\nCoach: 15,000 to 50,000 Alaska Airlines miles one-way\n\nBusiness Class: 40,000 to 80,000 Alaska Airlines miles one-way\n\nAt the low end of those ranges, the prices are pretty reasonable, especially for coach. But, if you’re being quoted more than 25,000 miles one-way for coach or 40,000 miles one-way for Business Class, there’s almost surely a better option.\n\nIf you want to fly American Airlines, the following prices apply:\n\nCoach: 22,500 Alaska Airlines miles one-way\n\nBusiness Class: 40,000 Alaska Airlines miles one-way\n\nThese prices are solid, but not really anything special.  There’s a good chance that you can almost always book with another airline for the same price or less, and usually with miles that are easier to earn than Alaska Airlines miles.  That said, if you have a bunch of Alaska Airlines miles or can’t make anything else work, this isn’t a bad option.\n\nPros: Low coach prices on Alaska Airlines’ own flights, ability to stopover on a one-way award flight\n\nCons: Relatively tough miles to earn\n\nOther notes:\n\nOne of the best things about Alaska Airlines miles is the ability to do a stopover on a one-way award ticket. This means if you are flying Alaska Airlines, you could stopover in their hub, Seattle. If you’re flying American Airlines, you could spend a day or two in Phoenix or Los Angeles (or any other American Airlines hub) on your way to Hawaii. If you book your return flight with Alaska Airlines miles, you can have another stopover on your return itinerary.\n\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA)\n\nANA is a good option for flights to Hawaii, but really only for coach flights. They are also a transfer partner of Amex Membership Rewards, giving you an option to pool your miles.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~7 days\n\nThe award chart and routing rules are relatively complicated, but if you want to find out more, check out the Amex Membership Rewards section of this post.\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nYou can use American Airlines miles to book flights on both American Airlines and Alaska to get to Hawaii. Coach prices are pretty good, especially if you are traveling during off peak times, but we generally wouldn’t recommend booking business class or first-class with American Airlines miles unless you don’t have other options.\n\nNote that American Airlines is moving toward dynamic pricing for its awards, so even though it still has an award chart, in practice the prices can be all over the place.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~2 days\n\nAward Prices: American Airlines offers flights to Hawaii in coach, business class, and first class. Coach prices are pretty reasonable especially if you are traveling during off peak dates. The prices for off-peak flights is 20,000 American Airlines miles each way. The regular coach price is 22,500 American Airlines miles each way. The AAnytime prices are both very high, You could fly in business class for the same number of miles or less.\n\nBusiness-class and first-class fights on American Airlines don’t have off peak pricing. In general, they are not as good of a deal as the coach prices. Business-class flights start at 40,000 American Airlines miles each way. Note that if you’re flying on a 3-cabin aircraft (one that has coach, business class, and first class), the mileage price will be 7,500 miles higher for each price level listed.\n\nIf you want to try out flying first class, you can do so on some flights to Hawaii. But, prices aren’t cheap. You’re looking at 65,000 American Airlines miles (or more!) for a one-way flight.\n\nPros: More access to American Airlines award seats than other partners have, good off-peak pricing for coach tickets\n\nCons: High business-class and first-class prices sometimes difficult to find SAAver award availability\n\nOther notes: Sometimes difficult to find SAAver award availability at peak times\n\nAsiana\n\nAsiana might not be a program that you’re very familiar with, but they have some great prices for flights to Hawaii. Unfortunately, Asiana miles aren’t that easy to earn, so you’ll have to save up your Marriott points if you want to use Asiana miles to get to Hawaii.\n\nAsiana is part of Star Alliance, so you can use Asiana miles to book flights to Hawaii on United Airlines.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: 10 days\n\nAward Prices: Asiana offers good award prices for flights from the U.S. to Hawaii. Coach awards start at only 25,000 Asiana miles round-trip and business-class and first-class awards cost 45,000 Asiana miles and 65,000 Asiana miles roundtrip, respectively. These are all great prices for flights to Hawaii if you can find award availability on United Airlines flights that works for your trip.\n\nOne-way award bookings are permitted at half of the price listed below.\n\nFuel Surcharges: Not something you need to worry about on flights to Hawaii.\n\nPros: Great award prices, especially for business class and first class, no phone booking fee, one-way award bookings allowed, low cancellation fee ($30 or 3,000 miles), no change fees\n\nCons: Relatively difficult to earn, poor award search for partner flights online, fuel surcharges on some partners (but not on flights to Hawaii)\n\nOther notes:\n\nIf you want to book a partner flight, you’ll have to call Asiana (800-227-4262) in order to do so. The call center is only open from Monday to Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time.\n\nAvianca\n\nAvianca miles are a good option for flights to Hawaii, and are also a transfer partner of Citi ThankYou Points.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: Unknown at this time\n\nFor more information on using Avianca miles to fly to Hawaii, visit the Citi ThankYou Point section of this post.\n\nBritish Airways\n\nBritish Airways presents one of the cheapest ways to get to Hawaii with miles if you are flying from the West Coast with a direct flight.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: Under 24 hours\n\nFor more information on redeeming British Airways Avios for flights to Hawaii, check out the Chase Ultimate Rewards section.\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles\n\nThe Cathay Pacific Asia Miles award chart is one of the more complex charts out there.  But, if you’re willing to put in some extra time, there is great value to be had!\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~10 days\n\nFor more information on redeeming Cathay Pacific Asia Miles for your Hawaiian vacation, read more in the Amex Membership Rewards section.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta doesn’t publish an award chart anymore, so it can be difficult to know if you’re getting the lowest price possible. Nevertheless, they do occasionally offer pretty good award sales for flights to Hawaii.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time:  ~2 days\n\nFor more information on using Delta miles to fly to Hawaii, check out the Amex Membership Rewards section.\n\nEmirates\n\nEmirates ins’t part of an alliance, but they do have a ton of partners. If your goal is to get from the U.S. to Hawaii, you can use Emirates miles for travel on Alaska Airlines. Emirates has different award prices for each partner, so for flights on Alaska Airlines, you’ll have to reference their Alaska award chart.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~6 days\n\nAward Prices: As mentioned before, Emirates has different award prices for each partner. For flights on Alaska Airlines to Hawaii, you’re looking at prices of 40,000 Emirates miles in coach and 75,000 Emirates miles in business class (first class) for round-trip flights. Emirates does not allow one-way award tickets on Alaska Airlines, so you’ll have to book round-trip.\n\nEmirates coach award prices are decent, but their business class (first class) award price is pretty high. If you’re not quite set on your dates, Emirates charges only a $25 date change fee which is incredibly reasonable.\n\nFuel Surcharges: None on flights to Hawaii\n\nPros: Reasonably low coach award price, low $25 date change fee\n\nCons: Round-trip bookings are required, miles are relatively difficult to earn\n\nOther notes:\n\nInfant tickets are not permitted\n\nEtihad\n\nWe’ve already covered Etihad in the Citi ThankYou points section of this post, and they’re a good option if you need to combine points from multiple programs or if you are traveling during their off peak dates.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~5 days\n\nTo find out more about using Etihad miles to get to Hawaii, visit the Citi ThankYou points section of this post.\n\nFlying Blue (KLM/Air France)\n\nKLM/Air France Flying Blue miles are one of the best ways to fly to Hawaii with miles if you can find available award seats. Not only do they have low prices, but they are also transfer partners of Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, and Citi ThankYou points, giving you great ability to combine miles from multiple programs.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~1 day\n\nIf you want to read about using Flying Blue miles to fly to Hawaii, visit the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nIberia\n\nIberia offers a distance-based award chart which can be very valuable if you have relatively short flights (even if they involve a connection). Iberia is also a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards and Amex Membership Rewards, giving you the opportunity to combine your points.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~6 days\n\nIf you want to find out more about using Iberia Avios points to get to Hawaii, visit the Amex Membership Rewards section of this post.\n\nLufthansa\n\nLufthansa miles are a pretty useful option for United Airlines flights to Hawaii. Like United Airlines, they are a member of Star Alliance. Unfortunately, Lufthansa miles aren’t that easy to earn because they are not a transfer partner of any of the other major transferable point currencies.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~6 days\n\nAward Prices: Lufthansa has a zone-based award chart, and award prices start at 40,000 Lufthansa miles round-trip in coach. Business class awards cost 70,000 Lufthansa miles and First Class awards cost 125,000 Lufthansa miles for round-trip bookings. One way award bookings are allowed and cost half of what a round-trip booking does.\n\nPros: Reasonable coach and Business Class award prices, one-way bookings allowed\n\nCons: Relatively difficult to earn\n\nOther notes:\n\nLufthansa allows two stopovers on round-trip awards, but unfortunately this doesn’t apply to stopovers in the same region as your departure. So, while this isn’t helpful for flights to Hawaii, it’s a great perk of the Lufthansa Miles & More program.\n\nQantas\n\nQantas also offers a distance-based award chart and they have one of the best award search engines for oneworld flights. They’re not going to be the best award option for everyone, but in certain circumstances they can be.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~6 days\n\nTo find out more about using Qantas points to get to Hawaii, read the Citi ThankYou point section.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines is a great option for flights to Hawaii, made even better by the fact that they are a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One and Citi ThankYou Points in addition to Marriott Rewards.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: ~6 days\n\nTo find out more about using Singapore Airlines miles to get to Hawaii, check out the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines miles aren’t going to give you the best prices for flights to Hawaii, but they are easy to earn and they are incredibly easy to use. United Airlines’ award search engine is straightfoward and you generally won’t have too much trouble finding available award seats, as long as you’re at least a little bit flexible.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: Under 24 hours\n\nIf you want to find out more about using United Airlines miles to fly to Hawaii, visit the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic miles are a great way to access both Delta and Hawaiian Airlines award seats, but not on the same ticket. Virgin Atlantic is a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards and Citi ThankYou points in addition to Marriott Rewards.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: Under 24 hours\n\nFor more information on using Virgin Atlantic Miles to get to Hawaii, visit the Chase Ultimate Rewards section of this post.\n\nTurkish Airlines\n\nTurkish Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance and it currently has the best award prices for flights from the U.S. to Hawaii of any airline.\n\nTransfer ratio: 3:1 with a 5,000 mile bonus for transfers in increments of 60,000 Marriott Rewards points\n\nTransfer time: Up to 24 hours\n\nAward Prices: \n\nRound-trip partner awards to Hawaii only cost 15,000 miles in economy and 25,000 miles in business. You can also book one-way flights for half the price.\n\nPros: The absolute cheapest award prices to Hawaii\n\nCons: You’ll have to find United Airlines saver awards and booking partner awards with Turkish Airlines isn’t always super easy. You can book them online, sometimes, but you’ll have better luck calling in to book (800-874-8875).\n\nBottom line\n\nRedeeming transferable points for award flights to Hawaii gives you the most flexibility and options to this popular bucket-list spot. That way, your trip to paradise won’t have to cost an arm and a leg.

          "description": "Recently, I was speaking with a highly accomplished female client. She had worked for years towards a promotion, but now that she had officially been offered it, she was seriously questioning whether it was the right time to accept it. As we probed further, it became clear that it was not the demands of the new job that concerned her, but the multitude of responsibilities, meaningful to mundane, outside the office.\n\nShe and her husband, also in a high-powered job, have three school-aged kids. He was extremely supportive of her career, but when it came to the mountain of little things, somehow they all fell on her plate, not his. It was the mental to-do list of little things that add up to an overwhelming mental load. “Where is that permission slip? “ “What’s on the menu for Thanksgiving at our house?” Through no one’s fault in particular, her professional ambitions were being impacted by a never-ending to-do list at home.\n\nShe’s not alone. In my over 10 years as an executive coach to mid- and senior-level executives, many clients have reported that feeling overburdened at home can reduce their desire to move ahead at work. This phenomenon seems to affect women more than men and is often misinterpreted by others (and sadly by the women themselves) as a lack of ambition or career confidence.\n\nThough more women are in the workforce than ever, the division of labor in heterosexual dual-career households often still falls along gendered lines, with women doing more childcare and housework. While recent time use studies show the gap closing in the number of chore hours men and women perform at home, women’s invisible work, or mental load seems as high as ever (research is looking at how this shows up in same-sex couples as well). Some things, like masterminding a busy family’s calendar, don’t take a lot of time but do take a substantial amount of mental energy. As a solution to this domestic imbalance, most friends or advice columns suggest that women ask for help or delegate more.\n\nWhile delegating feels like a step in the right direction, it is actually starting from the incorrect assumption that the work women are looking to delegate is theirs in the first place. It’s not. Delegating is ownership while asking someone to help—and does not relieve the mental burden because at some level, you still own the task.\n\nIt’s time for a paradigm shift: women need to stop delegating and start divvying.\n\nPrivy to divvy\n\n>Divvying means it is not your responsibility anymore and comes with the bonus of recouping some mental energy. The tasks involved in keeping kids thriving, and a home running smoothly, are communal tasks that should be placed on the table and as a couple divvied up in an intentional way.\n\nWhat does divvying look like in practice? As author Anne Marie Slaughter told The Cut in 2016:\n\nSo, sitting down and saying, “Let’s divvy this up. Let’s be realistic about the pickups, the feeding, the dressing, the bathing, the night duty, the diaper duty,” and that’s just the day-to-day care…. “Who is going to look into everything from Little League to summer camp?” So, laying it out, just like you would in a business, I think that’s the start.\n\nStacey McGarrity, the CEO of a national interior design firm, and her husband Chris, an entrepreneur, have gotten good at divvying when it comes to managing their demanding careers and parenting second grader Amelia. “We definitely divvy, we divide and conquer. So much so that I don’t have any idea what’s in her dance bag, because he’s ‘Dance Dad.’”\n\nHaving a supportive partner was always important to Stacey—she saw her mom struggle under the burden of working full time and taking care of the house and kids, and she didn’t want that for herself. But that doesn’t mean this explicit divvying of responsibilities came about completely naturally. Partners should sit down and think about all tasks—large and small, frequent and occasional—needed to keep their household running. Each partner should choose the things they love doing or are OK doing, then they consider outsourcing the tasks both hate doing.\n\nFor instance, Stacey owns religion because it was important to her but not as much to Chris. “I get up and take her to church, I make sure she goes to her CCD [catholic school] class, anything to do with the volunteer work at the church, all of that falls into my plate. And the only time that he’s asked to do something is if I’m out of town.”\n\nChris owns cooking. “I’ve never been a cook and he’s always like to cook, so he does grocery shopping. That’s why lunch falls into his category,” Stacey says.\n\nThanks to this strategy, Stacey feels she is able to be more successful, both as a mom and as a CEO. “It’s allowed me to grow my business and be more efficient,” she says; because not all the childcare duties fall to her, Amelia has the option to participate in more activities.\n\nBut the biggest perk from divvying is the transfer of mental ownership of responsibilities, and the practice of letting go. For many women, having the mental and emotional energy that was once consumed by little things at home frees them up to think bigger about what is possible for their careers. Having a partner they can truly hand things off to gives them even greater confidence to say “yes” more often at work—a luxury men have always had.\n\nThe client that I mentioned earlier, the one who considered not taking the promotion? At my recommendation, she did have a sit-down with her husband. She took the promotion. She doesn’t deal with permissions slips anymore!\n\nMichelle Friedman is an executive coach, consultant and speaker, and the founder of Advancing Women’s Careers, a NYC-based coaching and consulting firm that helps solve gender imbalance in the workplace. She and her husband are longtime divvy-ers.\n",

          "description": "The story of America is one of moving.\n\nA total of 13.6% of Americans today were born in another country, and most of us are descended from immigrants. This story of migration also includes moving within the country. Over the last 200 years, Americans have settled the frontier, moved away from cities toward suburbs, and migrated away from cities in the Northeast toward the South and West.\n\nThis narrative that Americans are constantly moving within the country is no longer true.\n\nOver the last 35 years, the number of Americans who have moved—within their county, state, or out of state—has steadily declined to nearly half of their previous levels.\n\nBetween March 2018 and 2019, only 1.5% of Americans moved from one state to another, and 5.9% moved from one home to another while remaining in the same county.\n\n1999-2005 inter-state migration rates are adjusted per Kaplan (2013). 1985 values are interpolated as the average of 1984 and 1986 values.\n\nWhy are Americans more rooted?\n\nThe decision to move is a complex one. People are often searching for better opportunities but must also take into account factors like family characteristics, lifestyle, and community.\n\nI have studied American migration for over 20 years, and I see no evidence linking the migration decline to changes in the way people make those decisions. Rather, I see three broad changes that have changed the outcome of those decisions.\n\nFirst, real incomes have remained flat for over the last 35 years. Americans have been able to improve their standard of living only by both working more and borrowing more. That includes an increase in the number of women working, leading to the growth of dual-income households.\n\nThe increase in both family and personal debt both makes selling a house more difficult and reduces financial resources available for a move. Meanwhile, the growth of dual-income households restricts moves, because any long-distance move would require both partners to find a suitable job in a new destination.\n\nSecond, the baby boomer generation has squeezed younger generations out of housing and job opportunities.\n\nFinally, Americans are less likely to move due to the widespread adoption of advanced information and communications technologies, such as the internet and smartphones.\n\nMy colleague and I investigated the role of these technologies in both the US and Northern Ireland. In these studies, we compared people who accessed and used the internet at home, in various ways, to people who did not, and found that internet access was strongly associated with decreased mobility.\n\nWe conclude that internet use, and likely all forms of advanced information and communication technologies, allow people to remain in a place, yet access a growing array of remote employment and educational opportunities. Moving is just not as necessary as it once was.\n\nWhat’s more, advanced information and communications technologies improves the quality of information available about possible places to move. We believe this makes decisions about whether and where to move more efficient and reduces the chances that people will move to a place that they don’t like.\n\nRootedness is the new normal\n\nThe currently low levels of geographic mobility are likely to be permanent.\n\nAn important principle of migration is that it is self-reinforcing—having moved once enhances the chances of moving again. Moving is expensive and stressful, especially for people who have not migrated before. But having moved once, additional moves become less stressful, new opportunities become available and additional moves become more efficient and less costly.\n\nThis self-reinforcing process works in the other direction as well. Having never moved or having moved very little reduces the chances of moving or moving again; migration is viewed as risky, expensive and disruptive. Plus, the longer a person stays in a location, the more attached they grow to their home and job and community.\n\nSince the current US population is more rooted than ever, I think it is likely that the country will continue to have lower migration rates into the future. Young adults who have been raised during the period of declining migration rates of the last 35 years are now less likely to migrate as a consequence. They may then pass this legacy on to their own children.\n\nThe impacts of a more rooted society\n\nI believe that the migration decline and associated increase in rootedness will have dramatic effects on American society.\n\nRootedness has many positive outcomes, such as greater attachment to place and more meaningful social and community connections. These connections to place may then serve to provide social and economic support during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nSecond, I suspect that the decline in migration will present a challenge to large corporations and regional economic development agencies, for example, which rely upon migration to attract and retain talent.\n\nFinally, the government’s approaches to resolving regional economic disparities will have to change. Federal and state governments traditionally have not intervened much in regional labor and housing markets, under the presumption that high levels of migration serve to reallocate people from areas with few opportunities and toward areas with many opportunities.\n\nThe decline in migration indicates to me that federal and state policy must shift more toward “place-based” policies, emphasizing training and education, along with developing industries tailored to local skills and resources, similar to what is more common in Europe.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Currently, it has a 50,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points welcome bonus, which you can earn after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening.\n\nSome people are scared off by the card’s $450 annual fee. But you might be surprised to hear that the yearly benefits are easily worth much more than that. You even get a $300 travel credit every cardmember year that applies to a wide range of purchases (more on this later). I’ll show you why it’s one of the best credit cards for travel.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred benefits make it perhaps THE best travel credit card. (Photo by Wyatt Smith)\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve benefits and perks\n\nUnlike other Chase Ultimate Rewards earning cards, you can redeem points on the Chase Sapphire Reserve for 1.5 cents each when you use them to pay for travel booked through the Chase Travel Portal. That makes it the best Chase credit card on the market.\n\nOne handy benefit of this card is that you can transfer the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn from other cards to this card, and they are instantly worth 1.5 cents each through the Chase Portal.\n\nAlso, with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you have the ability to transfer your Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Chase transfer partners:\n\nAer Lingus\n\nBritish Airways\n\nEmirates\n\nFlying Blue (Air France & KLM)\n\nHyatt\n\nIberia\n\nIHG\n\nJetBlue\n\nMarriott\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSouthwest\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThis is an incredibly valuable perk, and the best way to use Chase points. But those aren’t the only airlines you can travel on with Chase Ultimate Rewards points — you can use one airlines’ miles to book award flights with their partner airlines. For example, you can use British Airways Avios points to book American Airlines award seats, and Flying Blue miles can be used to book Delta flights. Read our full Chase Ultimate Rewards review for more details.\n\nYearly $300 travel credit\n\nI know that the Chase Sapphire Reserve’s $450 annual fee looks scary up front, but it’s not as daunting as it seems because the card has one of the best travel credit perks of any premium credit card. Every cardmember year you’ll get the first $300 spent on travel automatically reimbursed as a statement credit. So you can look at it as prepaying $300 in purchases you were going to make anyway. What qualifies for the travel credit? Lots of stuff, including:\n\nAirfare\n\nHotels, Airbnb, timeshares and campgrounds\n\nRental cars, Uber, trains and buses\n\nTolls and parking\n\nCruises and ferries\n\nThere are two things to note about the travel credit. The first is that while you normally earn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards points on travel purchases, the $300 in travel that is reimbursed as part of the credit won’t earn any points. So you’re sacrificing 900 Chase Ultimate Rewards points in exchange for $300. I’ll take that trade any day of the week.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve card’s travel credit applies to lots of purchases, including cruises. (Photo by Denis Belitsky/Shutterstock)\n\nAlso, some charges that may seem to be travel related might not qualify for the travel credit. This is the case with some vacation rentals because they might code as a real estate transaction instead of travel. Lots of people report that Airbnb stays do count as travel, but sometimes rentals through VRBO or HomeAway don’t end up coding that way.\n\nMost people I know spend much more than $300 combined in qualifying travel categories. So after the travel credit, you only need to get $150 a year in value from the Chase Sapphire Reserve to make it worth keeping. And as you’ll see, that’s not hard to do.\n\nEarn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards bonus points on dining and travel\n\nIf you want to amass Chase Ultimate Rewards points as quickly as possible, spending with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is the best way to accomplish that goal (other than earning a big intro bonus by opening a new card). With it, you’ll earn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards points on every qualifying travel and dining purchase.\n\nThis is also a great card to use while your traveling because not only does it not have any foreign transaction fees, but the 3X bonus for dining and travel applies to worldwide purchases. This isn’t the case with other travel rewards credit cards.\n\nTSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit\n\nDo you know what can really mess up a trip? Getting stuck in the airport security line and then missing your flight. So instead, you end up compensating by showing up way too early for every flight, then you’re stuck hanging out in the crowded airport longer than necessary. It’s a lose-lose situation.\n\nThe answer is TSAPreCheck or Global Entry (which comes with TSA PreCheck). Once you’re approved for it you can use an expedited security line (if your airport has one) when you’re flying with any of 60+ eligible airlines. Plus you won’t have to remove your shoes, belt or laptop. It makes airport security a breeze. It even saved Joseph from missing his flight and having to purchase a nearly $600 replacement flight. You can’t beat that!\n\nNormally TSA PreCheck costs $85 and Global Entry costs $100. Both are valid for five years. But if you pay either of those fees with your Chase Sapphire Reserve you’ll get the fee reimbursed up to $100, so it ends up being free. This credit replenishes every four years, so every time you need to renew your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry it will be free as long as you keep your Sapphire Reserve card.\n\nAirport lounge access\n\nWith the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you won’t need to dream of whiling away the hours of an unreasonably long connecting flight in a comfortable airport lounge with fast WiFi and complimentary food because it will be a reality for you. The card comes with a Priority Pass membership that is far more valuable than even the most expensive Priority Pass membership you can purchase – I’ll explain.\n\nThe best Priority Pass membership you can buy costs $429 per year and with it, you get free unlimited access to the 1,200+ lounges in the network. But you’ll need to pay $32 for each guest you want to bring along. But with the Chase Sapphire Reserve’s Priority Pass membership you get the same unlimited lounge access for yourself and two guests — and if you need to bring a third person along, it’s only $27 extra. If you travel with a partner and child that’s an easy $64 in savings per visit over purchasing a membership.\n\nPriority Pass lounges are all over the world — if you’re an international traveler, you’ll love its sizable 1,200+ lounge portfolio. (Photo by Katie Genter)\n\nOne of the hidden benefits of Priority Pass membership is that there are a growing number of airport restaurants that will accept your Priority Pass membership. Right now there are ~30 in the US alone. The rules vary slightly depending on the location, but in general, you’ll just need a same-day boarding pass and proof of your Priority Pass membership and you’ll get $28 to $32 dollars off your bill per person for up to two people. That’s an easy $56 to $64 off a good meal. And afterward, you’ll still have the option to relax in an airport lounge.\n\nPrimary rental car insurance\n\nThe rental car insurance that comes with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is primary coverage. That means you can decline the rental company’s collision damage waiver and it will still cover you for theft or damages. That’s a very real costs savings that could easily be $15+ per day. And filing a claim is pretty straight forward. Harlan was reimbursed for almost $700 in charges thanks to the rental insurance he got by paying for a rental with his Chase Sapphire Reserve.\n\nBest Trip Delay insurance\n\nTrip Delay insurance is one of those perks that’s easy to overlook until you need it. Just last year alone I was reimbursed over $500 from two separate Trip Delay insurance claims with my Ink Business Preferred℠ Credit Card and Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. The Trip Delay insurance for both of these cards covers expenses you incur as the result of an eligible trip delay, including:\n\nGround transportation (rental, taxi, etc.)\n\nLodging\n\nFood\n\nIncidentals (toiletries, clothing, medications, etc.)\n\nThe coverage you get with those cards only applies to delays that are 12+ hours long or require an overnight stay and will cover you for up to $500 per ticket.  What you get with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is much more useful.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve’s Trip Delay coverage will reimburse you for the same $500 per ticket, but it covers delays of six hours or more, or ones that require an overnight stay. That’s a big difference.\n\nDelayed baggage insurance\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve gives travelers $100 per day for up to five days if a bag has been delayed for six hours or more. This is a benefit many of us on the team have had to use. If you’ve never had a lost or delayed bag, it’s only a matter of time!\n\nLost luggage insurance\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve will cover the cost to repair or replace lost luggage and personal items. You’ll receive up to $3,000 per person each trip, with a limit of $500 for items such as jewelry and electronics.\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance\n\nThis perk will provide you with up to $10,000 per person per covered trip (maximum $20,000 per occurrence). You’ll receive up to $40,000 per 12-month period.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve cardholders can take advantage of the roadside assistance benefits, which means you can save on annual fees with programs like AAA.\n\nSome of the coverage could be so valuable that just using it once could pay for the card many times over.\n\nEmergency evacuation and transportation\n\nWhen you pay for a trip with your Chase Sapphire Reserve card, you’ll have emergency evacuation and transportation benefits if you are injured or become ill during your trip. The maximum coverage amount is $100,000, which may seem like a lot, but evacuation from a remote location can be extremely expensive.\n\nCoverage with the Sapphire Reserve is supplemental, meaning you’ll be covered after any primary coverage you may have. The following people will have emergency evacuation coverage as long as you pay for all or part of their trip with your Chase Sapphire Reserve:\n\nCardholder\n\nCardholder’s spouse\n\nLegally dependent children under age 18 (age 25 if enrolled as a full-time student)\n\nChase Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection benefits\n\nThe Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection is available to many Chase credit cards, the Chase Sapphire Reserve being one of them. If you book through the Chase Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection, you’ll get the following perks:\n\nComplimentary Wi-Fi\n\nSpecial benefit unique to each hotel (i.e. hotel credit, etc.)\n\nFree daily breakfast for two\n\nEarly check-in (if available)\n\nLate check-out (if available)\n\nRoom upgrade (if available)\n\nYou’ll even get a special benefit, like a $100 food credit, a spa credit, etc. I booked a stay through the Chase LHR Collection for my wife and me at the Park Hyatt Chicago, and we received a $100 credit toward a fancy dinner, free breakfast, late check-out, and a small room upgrade. Plus, we still earned Hyatt points for the stay.\n\nTo receive these benefits, book through the Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection website or with one of their travel specialists and use your eligible Chase card to purchase your stay.\n\nOverall value\n\nLet me first say that if you’re a casual traveler who travels domestically once or twice a year to visit the family for the holidays, this card is probably overkill for you. If you fly more often, or if you take an international trip or two each year, you’ll do well with this card.\n\nThe first year you have this card, expect to receive $1,829 in value:\n\n$1,000 – 50,000 point sign-up bonus (based on our estimation of Chase points value)\n\n$300 – annual travel credit that automatically triggers when you use your card for a travel purchase\n\n$100 – Statement credit for Global Entry and TSA PreCheck\n\n$429 – Value of a Priority Pass lounge membership\n\nHowever, after the first year you can expect to receive a value of $829 (the only difference will be no sign-up bonus). This is an unbelievably conservative estimate, considering:\n\nYou’ll save money hand over fist if you use the card’s primary rental car insurance with any frequency\n\nYou’ll earn 3 Chase points per dollar at restaurants and on travel\n\nYou’ll inevitably receive compensation from Chase for a canceled flight or delayed bags thanks to its top-notch travel insurance\n\nAgain, if you don’t travel often, the Chase Sapphire Reserve benefits won’t be worth as much to you.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve has all the bells and whistles you could want from a premium travel credit card. And while it does have a $450 annual fee, it’s surprisingly easy to get many times that in value each year you have the card. The annual travel credit alone will reimburse for the first $300 in eligible travel purchases you make each cardmember year. And other perks like the generous Priority Pass Membership and TSA Precheck/Global Entry free credit are worth more than $150 combined to most people.\n\nBut maybe the biggest reason to get the card s the fact that it can make all of your other Chase Ultimate Rewards points more valuable. With the card, you can use your Ultimate Rewards points to book travel through the Chase Travel Portal at a rate of 1.5 cents each, which is up to 50% more than other Chase Ultimate Rewards cards.\n\nYou can apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card here.\n\nIf you want more tips, tricks, and secrets to make the most of your miles & points, then subscribe to our newsletter.\n",

          "description": "Today I want to share a story from TPG reader Krzysztof, who took advantage of an award chart sweet spot to book a family vacation:\n\nOur family of four visited Hawaii back in 2014. We spent 15 days there, visiting Oahu, Maui and the Big Island and booking most of the trip with points. We had a blast, but we were unable to visit Kauai, and have been talking about going back to spend some time on the Garden Isle for a while. Finally, the moment has arrived.\n\nWith more and more loyalty devaluations, planning a Hawaii trip with points is now more challenging, but by no means impossible. A few months ago, I read an article about a sweet spot of the Turkish Airlines loyalty program Miles & Smiles, which offers round-trip economy awards from the U.S. to Hawaii for only 15,000 miles. The airline is a member of the Star Alliance along with United Airlines, which offers lots of flights to Hawaii. Finding saver economy award space isn’t easy (especially in the summer), but we were lucky enough to find four seats from Philadelphia to Lihue in July, 2020.\n\nI didn’t have miles in my Miles & Smiles account, but fortunately I had accumulated 65,000 Citi ThankYou points through bonus offers and spending. ThankYou points can be transferred to Turkish Airlines at a 1:1 ratio, so I had enough. I called Miles & Smiles customer service before transferring the points to confirm availability and possibly hold a reservation so that there would be enough time to complete the transfer. Unfortunately, we could not book the awards by phone, so I had to either visit a Turkish Airlines sales office or book by email. Since I live about three hours from the nearest office (at JFK), the only option left for me was email.\n\nI was skeptical about booking tickets through email, especially due to the time sensitivity of the process, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received a response from an agent a few hours after my initial email. The agent confirmed the availability of the requested seats, but could only hold them until the end of the day. I knew that transfers to Miles & Smiles are not instantaneous and sometimes take days to process, but luckily, the miles were in my account the next morning and I was able to book the tickets the same day.\n\nThe total cost: 60,000 ThankYou points plus $22.40 in taxes for four round-trip tickets to Lihue in July of 2020. The redemption value was incredible, as the cash cost of these tickets was more than $3,200! I was able to book our hotels using points as well: We will be staying five nights at the Hilton Garden Inn Kauai Wailua Bay (200,000 Hilton Honors points with the fifth night free) and three nights at the Grand Hyatt Kauai (75,000 World of Hyatt points). The combined cash cost of the two bookings is well above $4,000. We are all very excited and are currently planning our activities. Kauai, here we come!\n\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nYou have a variety of good options for booking award flights to Hawaii, including British Airways awards starting at 13,000 points each way from the West Coast, and increasing opportunities to use the Southwest Companion Pass as the airline continues to add service to the Hawaiian Islands. But the gem of the bunch is Turkish Airlines. In addition to economy awards for 7,500 miles each way, you can book domestic first-class awards for just 12,500 miles each way, which is less than many frequent flyer programs charge for economy flights on the same route. Both are incredible deals if you can find availability.\n\nThe upside of a good deal (and the downside of a bad one) compounds when you’re traveling as a family or in a group. The process for booking Miles & Smiles awards is more complicated than some, and depending on your other options, the savings might not justify the extra effort if you only need a single ticket. Multiply those savings by three or four people, however, and suddenly the extra effort becomes much more worthwhile. Just like going out of your way to maximize rewards earned, you should account for the value of your time and energy when you’re deciding how to redeem.\n\nRelated: The best way to fly with kids to Hawaii\n\nI love this story and I want to hear more like it!

The streaming service went live today, and while the normal cost is $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year (there are several bundled services also available), a subset of Verizon customers can save quite a bit of money by getting a year of Disney+ for free.\n\nAll you have to do is go to Verizon’s Disney+ page (you can’t get it through the Disney+ site) and sign up. However, as you can imagine, there are some requirements if you want to take advantage of this offer.\n\nFirst, you have to subscribe to one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, including Go Unlimited, Beyond Unlimited, Above Unlimited, Get More Unlimited, Do More Unlimited, Play More Unlimited, or Start Unlimited. This offer is available for existing Unlimited customers, current Verizon customers who want to switch to Unlimited, and people who are willing to switch from other carriers. There are separate links on the Verizon page for each category.\n\nIf you’re an Unlimited customer and you’ve already signed up for Disney+, you can still get the free 12 months. Basically, the subscription you pre-purchased will be paused, and it will automatically resume after the free year is up. According to Verizon, you will get an email with instructions on how to manage things.\n\nFinally, you can also redeem a free year of Disney+ if you sign up for a new Fios or 5G Home internet plan. Unfortunately, in this case, only new customers are eligible; existing customers are out of luck.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

          "description": "Do you love travel? Do you also love animals? Then you’re in luck, because today we’re diving into one of my absolute favorite travel services. I’m talking about Trusted Housesitters, a free program that matches people needing house and pet-sitters with people looking for a place to stay while traveling.\n\nOf course, it isn’t totally free. The service costs $118/year for those looking simply to housesit or find sitters, or $148/year if you’d like to have both options. In return, you get access to the site and its thousands of listings, which vary from Victorian-style lodges in New Zealand to Italian villas in Tuscany.\n\nI know, it sounds too good to be true. But it makes sense when you think about it. People have pets, and people like to travel. Trusted Housesitters strikes two birds with one stone by allowing those wanting to see the world to do so by exchanging petsitting services for free lodging. It’s a win-win.\n\nThere are tons of different ways to search the site, with durations from one day all the way to six months. You can even choose what kind of animals you’d like to take care of. And if you don’t like animals at all? There’s an option for that, too:\n\nAnd if you’re concerned about safety, the site has verification measures for all sitters, and the more steps you take for verification, the more likely you are to be chosen for a housesit.\n\nThe site even comes with insurance for homeowners, in case of accidents:\n\nI’ve used Trusted Housesitters countless times when traveling (as a pet- and home-owner) and had wonderful experiences. In fact, just a week ago I used the service to have a couple watch my dog while I traveled to Kazakhstan. It’s great, not only because it’s free, but because in-house dog sitting means that your own beloved pets don’t have to deal with the unfamiliarity of boarding.\n\nEven my grandparents have traveled around the world using this service, and they are absolute fans. Here’s what they have to say about sitting with Trusted Housesitters: “It’s a very different experience seeing a new location from the eyes of a local and to have the convenience of a whole home in a real residential neighborhood. There’s also nothing quite like the eager greeting you get from the critters in your care when you return from a day of sightseeing!”\n\nIt doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nSign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more travel tips!\n\nFeature photo courtesy of fixnfly/Flickr\n",

          "description": "The 50th season of Sesame Street kicked off yesterday (Nov. 9) with a new message for kids: Failure isn’t always a bad thing.\n\nThis season, the popular cast of muppets will focus on the role that making mistakes can play in building young children’s resilience. Entitled “Oops and Aha!: Embracing the Power of Possibilities,” this theme is especially relevant in the US, where preschool-aged children are increasingly pressured to meet “school readiness” standards and where pediatricians have to prescribe play time to over-scheduled kids.\n\n“Today’s preschool kids are under an unprecedented amount of stress and pressure to meet certain academic and social-emotional benchmarks, often before they’re developmentally ready,” Rosemarie Truglio, Sesame Workshop’s senior vice president for curriculum and content, said in a release. “That result-oriented mindset can make kids afraid to take even the safest risks—never trying to pour their own milk for fear of spilling it.”\n\nYUCK I hate celebrations. Have a rotten 50th birthday Sesame Street… #Sesame50\n\n— Oscar the Grouch (@OscarTheGrouch) November 10, 2019\n\nBetween birth and age school age, children’s brains develop quickly, and science shows play can help them learn to focus attention, communicate, problem-solve, and work with others. Sesame Street has long touted the benefits of play and pressure-free learning environments for kids. But in a world where hyper-competitive education systems can sometimes determine a child’s future before they are even born, that message is all the more important.\n\nThe show’s 50th season will focus on the role that caregivers can play in allowing—and even at times encouraging—kids to make mistakes and learn to bounce back from them. According to Sesame Workshop, one episode will feature 3-year-old muppet Rudy Cadabby getting upset when he “ruins” a drawing. Alan Muraoka, the current owner of Hooper’s Store, then encourages Rudy to keep trying, and Rudy eventually makes a new drawing inspired by his mistake.\n\nThe goal is to model important values like confidence, perseverance, and resilience—values that researchers say today’s preschoolers are lacking.\n",

          "description": "The Nobel Prize goes to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer (links to home pages) for field experiments in development economics. Esther Duflo was a John Bates Clark Medal winner, a MacArthur “genius” award winner, and is now the second woman to win the economics Nobel and by far the youngest person to ever win the economics Nobel (Arrow was the previous youngest winner!). Duflo and Banerjee are married so these are also the first spouses to win the economics Nobel although not the first spouses to win Nobel prizes–there was even one member of a Nobel prize winning spouse-couple who won the Nobel prize in economics. Can you name the spouses?\n\nMichael Kremer wrote two of my favorite papers ever. The first is Patent Buyouts which you can find in my book Entrepreneurial Economics: Bright Ideas from the Dismal Science. The idea of a patent buyout is for the government to buy a patent and rip it up, opening the idea to the public domain. How much should the government pay? To decide this they can hold an auction. Anyone can bid in the auction but the winner receives the patent only say 10% of the time–the other 90% of the time the patent is bought by the government at the market price. The value of this procedure is that 90% of the time we get all the incentive properties of the patent without any of the monopoly costs. Thus, we eliminate the innovation tradeoff. Indeed, the government can even top the market price up by say 15% in order to increase the incentive to innovate. You might think the patent buyout idea is unrealistic. But in fact, Kremer went on to pioneer an important version of the idea, the Advance Market Commitment for Vaccines which was used to guarantee a market for the pneumococcal vaccine which has now been given to some 143 million children. Bill Gates was involved with governments in supporting the project.\n\nMy second Kremer paper is Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. An economist examining one million years of the economy! I like to say that there are two views of humanity, people are stomachs or people are brains. In the people are stomachs view, more people means more eaters, more takers, less for everyone else. In the people are brains view, more people means more brains, more ideas, more for everyone else. The people are brains view is my view and Paul Romer’s view (ideas are nonrivalrous). Kremer tests the two views. He shows that over the long run economic growth increased with population growth. People are brains.\n\nOh, and can I add a third Kremer paper? The O-Ring Model of Development is a great and deep paper. (MRU video on the O-ring model).\n\nThe work for which the Nobel was given is for field experiments in development economics. Kremer began this area of research with randomized trials of educational policies in Kenya. Duflo and Banerjee then deepened and broadened the use of field experiments and in 2003 established the Poverty Action Lab which has been the nexus for field experiments in development economics carried on by hundreds of researchers around the world.\n\nMuch has been learned in field experiments about what does and also doesn’t work. In Incentives Work, Dufflo, Hanna and Ryan created a successful program to monitor and reduce teacher absenteeism in India, a problem that Michael Kremer had shown in Missing in Action was very serious with some 30% of teachers not showing up on a typical day. But when they tried to institute a similar program for nurses in Putting a Band-Aid on A Corpse the program was soon undermined by local politicians and “Eighteen months after its inception, the program had become completely ineffective.” Similarly, Banerjee, Duflo, Glennerster and Kinnan find that Microfinance is ok but no miracle (sorry fellow laureate Muhammad Yunus). A frustrating lesson has been the context dependent nature of results and the difficult of finding external validity. (Lant Pritchett in a critique of the “randomistas” argues that real development is based on macro-policy rather than micro-experiment. See also Bill Easterly on the success of the Washington Consensus.)\n\nDuflo, Kremer and Robinson study How High Are Rates of Return to Fertilizer? Evidence from Field Experiments in Kenya. This is an especially interest piece of research because they find that rates of return are very high but that farmers don’t use much fertilizer. Why not? The reasons seem to have much more to do with behavioral biases than rationality. Some interventions help:\n\nOur findings suggest that simple interventions that affect neither the cost of, nor the payoff to, fertilizer can substantially increase fertilizer use. In particular, offering farmers the option to buy fertilizer (at the full market price, but with free delivery) immediately after the harvest leads to an increase of at least 33 percent in the proportion of farmers using fertilizer, an effect comparable to that of a 50 percent reduction in the price of fertilizer (in contrast, there is no impact on fertilizer adoption of offering free delivery at the time fertilizer is actually needed for top dressing). This finding seems inconsistent with the idea that low adoption is due to low returns or credit constraints, and suggests there may be a role for non–fully rational behavior in explaining production decisions.\n\nThis is reminiscent of people in developing countries who don’t adjust their retirement savings rates to take advantage of employer matches. (A connection to Thaler’s work).\n\nDuflo and Banerjee have conducted many of their field experiments in India and have looked at not just conventional questions of development economics but also at politics. In 1993, India introduced a constitutional rule that said that each state had to reserve a third of all positions as chair of village councils for women. In a series of papers, Duflo studies this natural experiment which involved randomization of villages with women chairs. In Women as Policy Makers (with Chattopadhyay) she finds that female politicians change the allocation of resources towards infrastructure of relevance to women. In Powerful Women (Beaman et al.) she finds that having once had a female village leader increases the prospects of future female leaders, i.e. exposure reduces bias.\n\nBefore Banerjee became a randomistas he was a theorist. His A Simple Model of Herd Behavior is also a favorite. The essence of the model can be explained in a simple example (from the paper). Suppose there are two restaurants A and B. The prior probability is that A is slightly more likely to be a better restaurant than B but in fact B is the better restaurant. People arrive at the restaurants in sequence and as they do they get a signal of which restaurant is better and they also see what choice the person in front of them made. Suppose the first person in line gets a signal that the better restaurant is A (contrary to fact). They choose A. The second person then gets a signal that the better restaurant is B. The second person in line also sees that the first person chose A, so they now know one signal is for A and one is for B and the prior is A so the weight of the evidence is for A—the second person also chooses restaurant A. The next person in line also gets the B signal but for the same reasons they also choose A. In fact, everyone chooses A even if 99 out of 100 signals are B. We get a herd. The sequential information structure means that the information is wasted. Thus, how information is distributed can make a huge difference to what happens. A lot of lessons here for tweeting and Facebook!\n\nBanerjee is also the author of some original and key pieces on Indian economic history, most notably History, Institutions, and Economic Performance: The Legacy of Colonial Land Tenure Systems in India (with Iyer).\n\nDuflo’s TED Talk. Previous Duflo posts; Kremer posts; Banerjee posts on MR.\n\nBefore last year’s Nobel announcement Tyler wrote:\n\nI’ve never once gotten it right, at least not for exact timing, so my apologies to anyone I pick (sorry Bill Baumol!). Nonetheless this year I am in for Esther Duflo and Abihijit Banerjee, possibly with Michael Kremer, for randomized control trials in development economics.\n\nAs Tyler predicted he was wrong and also right. Thus, this years win is well-timed and well-deserved. Congratulations to all.\n\nThe post The Nobel Prize in Economic Science Goes to Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

These ultra-wealthy families accidentally revealed a mindset that seems to be counter-productive.\n\nIt goes something like this:\n\n“We’re special, and we prefer a more ‘sophisticated’ form of investing, one that is complex and nuanced and holds the promise of greater performance (even if it might underperform).”\n\nI have been debating this crowd for at least a decade. I created a presentation called “Romancing Alpha, Forsaking Beta” for an event of ultra high net worth investors at Tiger 21. It was a very soft admonition that the approach taken by many family offices was complicated, expensive, and failed to deliver alpha.\n\nIt was an inoffensive data-filled  discussion that suggested family offices take a closer look at their actual, post tax, net of fees performance. “If you are fortunate enough to have invested in the top 2% of alternatives — hedge funds, venture capital or private equity — then great, keep your money there.” But everyone else should perform a review to see how they would have done with a simple 60/40 allocation (including munis). And to repeat, run your comparisons and results on an after fee, post tax basis.\n\nThat argument failed. Many seem to be convinced their investments were top 2% (hence the suggestion to audit the actual numbers). I doubt I persuaded anyone in the room.\n\nIn fact, since then, this allocation to alternatives has gotten even greater. The biggest winner of flows is private equity. Institutional Investor has the data: “Alternative assets account for a large portion of family office allocations, rising 1.4 percentage points last year to more than 40 percent of their portfolios.”\n\nThe ultra-wealthy have more than 40% in alternatives!\n\nMeanwhile, Mom & Pop have become fee-sensitive, moving billions to Vanguard and Blackrock.\n\nThey win.\n\nThe ultra-wealthy have doubled down, pursuing sexy, pricey alpha at the expense of cheap, effective beta. The consultants still rake in fees. The smart money has become dumb. Wall Street is perplexed. The dumb money is no longer dumb, and are kicking everyone else’s ass.\n\nMaybe it is time to retire the phrase “dumb money — at least as applied to main street investors . . .\n\n \n\nThe post Investing for the Elite appeared first on The Big Picture.\n",

          "description": "Here are some new and very thorough results from Peter Arcidiacono, Josh Kinsler, and the excellent Tyler Ransom:\n\nThe lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.\n\nAm I allowed to observe that this seems wrong to me?  And that our “liberal elite” (not my preferred term, but what you see in the discourse and I don’t know which other referent to use) has failed us?\n\nAnd from Garett Jones:\n\nControlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.\n\nHere is the full paper.  For the pointer I thank various MR readers.\n\nThe post How Harvard makes admissions decisions appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

In recent installments of this series, I’ve presented some low-tier Marriott properties, domestic Hyatt properties, international Hyatt properties, domestic Hilton properties, international Hilton properties and domestic IHG properties where you can stretch your points.\n\nIt’s not a secret that my husband, JT, and I have stayed at a lot of IHG properties since giving up our apartment over two years ago. In fact, we’ve actually stayed at many of the properties described below. So, even more so than the previous installments of this series, the list below isn’t simply a theoretical discussion of IHG’s best international properties that you can book for 10,000 points per night. Instead, it’s a compilation of hotels that we’re likely to visit (or revisit) due to their location and how far our points can take us there.\n\nLet’s continue this miniseries by studying how many nights you can squeeze out of the current 125,000-point sign-up bonus on the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card, as well as look at some international IHG properties where you can stay for just 10,000 points per night.\n\nIn This Post\n\nHow many nights can I get from the bonus?\n\nThe IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card currently offers an increased sign-up bonus of 125,000 points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months. The card provides an anniversary free night that’s valid at properties costing 40,000 points or less, which makes it relatively easy for most cardholders to justify the $89 annual fee. But the card’s other perks, including IHG Platinum Elite status, can also provide significant value. Plus, cardholders get a fourth night free on award stays, which means you can stretch your points even further when you stay for four nights or longer.\n\nRelated: IHG Rewards Club Premier Card credit card review\n\nIHG award nights normally start at 10,000 points per night. So not counting the points earned while meeting the spending requirements to trigger the welcome bonus, you could squeeze 16 nights out of the IHG Premier Card’s 125,000-point bonus if you stay in increments of four nights at 10,000-point properties (aka four nights for 30k points). TPG’s most recent valuation pegs the value of IHG points at 0.5 cents each, so 10,000 points are worth about $50 and the 30,000 points needed for a four-night stay at a 10,000-point property are worth about $150.\n\nAlternatively, you could book select properties from the PointBreaks list for as little as 5,000 points per night. This means you could theoretically squeeze 33 nights out of the IHG Premier Card’s 125,000-point bonus. But, since the properties on the PointBreaks list change every few months and are removed from the list once the PointBreaks allotment for that property is exhausted, this guide only considers properties that normally cost 10,000 points per night.\n\nProperty profiles\n\nIHG currently has 366 10,000-point properties globally and 248 of these properties, or 68%, are outside the U.S. Here’s the breakdown based on brand of the 10,000-point IHG properties located outside the U. S:\n\nBrand\n\nProperty description\n\n10,000-point properties outside the U.S.\n\nPercent of 10,000-point properties outside the U.S.\n\nHoliday Inn Express\n\nHotel that includes breakfast with your room, but doesn’t offer an on-site restaurant\n\n175\n\n71%\n\nHoliday Inn\n\nHotel that provides more services than a Holiday Inn Express but breakfast isn’t usually included in your room rate; sometimes has an on-site restaurant\n\n66\n\n27%\n\nHoliday Inn Express & Suites\n\nLike a Holiday Inn Express, but with suites\n\n3\n\n1%\n\nHoliday Inn & Suites\n\nLike a Holiday Inn, but with suites\n\n3\n\n1%\n\nHoliday Inn Resort\n\nLike a Holiday Inn, but with resort features and amenities\n\n1\n\n",

          "description": "There’s currently an ongoing debate about the value of data and whether internet companies should do more to share their data with others. At Google we’ve long believed that open data and open source are good not only for us and our industry, but also benefit the world at large.\n\nOur commitment to open source and open data has led us to share datasets, services and software with everyone. For example, Google released the Open Images dataset of 36.5 million images containing nearly 20,000 categories of human-labeled objects. With this data, computer vision researchers can train image recognition systems. Similarly, the millions of annotated videos in the YouTube-8M collection can be used to train video recognition.\n\nWith respect to language processing, we’ve shared the Natural Questions database, which contains 307,373 human-generated questions and answers. We’ve also made available the Trillion Word Corpus, which is based on words used on public web pages, and the Ngram Viewer, that can be used to explore the more than 25 million books in Google Books. These collections can be used for statistical machine translation, speech recognition, spelling correction, entity detection, information extraction and other language research.\n\nAnd these are only a few  examples of a much broader activity: Google AI currently lists 62 datasets of this sort that we’re making available to the research community.   \n\nWe also host a large number of publicly available datasets, such as the 20,000 Kaggle Open Datasets and the Cloud Public Datasets, which allows people to access frequently used public data directly from their workspace.\n\nGoogle also offers Google Trends, a free service that enables anyone to see and download aggregate search activity since 2004 for Google Search, Image Search, News Search, Shopping and YouTube. You can get search information for countries, regions, metro areas and cities on a monthly, weekly, daily and even hourly basis. The Trends data is widely used by researchers in fields as varied as medicine and economics. According to Google Scholar, there aremore than 21,000 research papers that cite Trends as a data source.\n\nGoogle is also a major contributor to open source software.  Key examples of this include Android, our smartphone operating system, Chromium, the code base for our Chrome browser (now also powering many competitors), and TensorFlow, our machine learning system. Google’s release of Kubernetes changed cloud hosting forever, and has enabled innovation and competition across the cloud industry. Google is also the largest contributor of open source code to GitHub, a shared repository for software development. In 2017, Googlers made more than 250,000 changes to tens of thousands of projects on GitHub alone.\n\nFinally, we’ve also released over 5,300 research reports written at Google, most of which have subsequently been published in scientific journals or conference proceedings.  \n\nOf course, it is costly to create and compile this data, software, and research. So why do we release these materials free of charge?\n\nFirst and foremost, our primary mission is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Certainly one obvious way to make information universally accessible and useful is to give it away! \n\nSecond, making these materials available stimulates scientific research outside of Google. We know we can’t do it all, and we spend a lot of time reading, understanding and often extending work done by others, some of which has been developed using tools and data we have provided to the research community. This mix of competition and cooperation among groups of researchers is what pushes science forward.\n\nThird, when we hire new employees, it’s great if they can hit the ground running and already know and use the tools we have developed. Familiarity with our software and data makes engineers productive from their first day at work.\n\nThere are many more reasons to share research data, but these three alone justify the practice. We aren’t the only internet company to appreciate the power of open data, code, and open research. Our colleagues in academia, and many other companies follow the same practices for much the same reasons.\n\nOf course, we can’t release all the data we use in our business. We need to protect user privacy, maintain confidentiality for business customers, and protect Google’s own intellectual property. But, subject to such considerations, we generally try to make our data as “universally accessible and useful” as possible.\n",

          "description": "Dress shirts are a men’s wardrobe staple and a sartorial workhorse that can go from dressy to sharp casual and from the office to date night at a pub. Button-ups look great with a more formal suit, while button-downs can be worn under a sport coat, with chinos and a tie, or alone with a pair of jeans. And dress shirts are not only thoroughly versatile, they’re also pretty universally handsome and flattering — at least, if they fit well. \n\nUnfortunately, many men are walking around in dress shirts that decidedly do not fit well — being either too small, or most frequently, 1-2 sizes too big. While the wearers themselves may not notice it, other people will. Poorly-fitting dress shirts give you a look that’s unprofessional, sloppy, and just generally less sharp than it could be.\n\nThe reason most men wear dress shirts that don’t fit them right, is that they don’t realize that when they get them off the rack, they’re typically not ready to wear. No off-the-rack shirt is going to fit your measurements perfectly. So once you buy a dress shirt, your next step is to take it to a skilled tailor (here’s how to find one), so he can adjust it so it fits you just right. Alternatively, you can buy a custom-made dress shirt that’ll fit you nicely from the get-go.\n\nNot all adjustments can readily be made by a tailor, so you’ll still want to buy an off-the-rack dress shirt that fits as well as possible from the start (though it’s better to buy a little big than small, so the tailor has something to work with). To aid in your selection process, and enable you to know what later adjustments to make, below we explain what mistakes to avoid in the fit of a dress shirt and how each detail of it should ultimately look and lay. \n\nDress Shirt Collar Fit\n\nThe collar of your dress shirt has one main job: to frame your face. Without a well-fitted collar, you end up with a noticeably unbalanced garment. That’s why you should pay close attention to the collar when you first try something on. A bad collar can make a $200 shirt look sloppy, while a great one can make a $20 shirt look amazing.\n\nToo Tight: The collar is close enough to actually pinch the skin underneath. You’ll feel it right away, and it’s quite uncomfortable. It would be impossible to place a finger between the neck and collar without stretching or tugging.\n\nToo Loose: The collar doesn’t touch the neck, but rests on the whole area surrounding it, almost like the collar of a coat that was lazily hung up. There’s also a gap that’s large enough to squeeze in about four fingers.\n\nJust Right: The proper fit means that the collar touches the skin all the way around the neck, but doesn’t press against it. You’re able to slip two fingers comfortably in between your neck and the collar at any point.\n\nDress Shirt Shoulder Fit\n\nToo Tight: The shoulder points are shifted in from your shoulders and towards the neck. Part of the sleeves may also end up resting over the shoulders, causing wrinkles. \n\nToo Loose: The shoulder points slump off the shoulders and down onto your upper arms. The shirt is prone to ballooning and making your upper body look bigger. It’s hard to adjust these points, so don’t bother having it tailored.\n\nJust Right: This is where the shoulder points sit perfectly at the edge of your shoulders, where the plane of the shoulder meets the plane of the outer arm. The armscye (the hole where the sleeve joins the shirt body) is large enough that it doesn’t cause tugging or twisting of the shoulder seam, which allows you to move your arms freely and comfortably.\n\nDress Shirt Torso Fit\n\nToo Tight: You’ll notice that the buttons strain to close, which causes wrinkles to form around the buttonholes. The tightness may also cause some pulling on the sleeves, putting pressure on the shoulder seams.\n\nToo Loose: The excess fabric tends to billow around your waist or chest. This is the kind of shirt that causes “muffin-topping” from the waist area. The solution here is to have the torso brought in, to simply size down, or to try another brand with a better fit.\n\nJust Right: You’ll have no problem buttoning up this shirt. The underside of the placket (where the buttons and buttonholes meet) is supposed to rest lightly against the midpoint of your ribcage. The shirt can be tucked in without any billowing.\n\nDress Shirt Sleeve Fit\n\nToo Tight: Wearing the shirt with your arms hanging down, you’ll get a “pinching” feeling when your elbow or shoulder moves. The sleeves will limit your movement and show off way too many wrinkles.\n\nToo Loose: The sleeves have so much slack that they naturally create folds of cloth all over, especially around the cuff. It’s likely there are over 3 inches of excess fabric in the sleeves, so they should either be brought in or sized down.\n\nJust Right: The sleeve should be slightly wider at the upper arm than the cuff, with a smooth, even taper. There’s also some looseness (about 1-2 inches of fabric) when the arms are hanging down straight. This gives you sufficient freedom of movement.\n\nDress Shirt Sleeve Length\n\nToo Short: This is where either the wrist bones are left exposed, or the cuffs get hidden completely underneath the sleeves of your jacket. Neither situation makes the shirt look good, so you’ll need to find a different brand with longer sleeves.\n\nToo Long: The sleeves extend all the way to the heel of your hands. This leads to some fabric bunching up at the point where the cuffs end. When you wear a watch, it’s going to be covered by the sleeve every time.\n\nJust Right: The sleeves come all the way down to the hinge of your wrist and just cover the large wrist bone. When you’re wearing a jacket, about 1/2 inch of shirt cuff is seen beyond the end of the jacket sleeves. The cuff should also touch (and in some postures cover) your watch whenever you wear it.\n\nDress Shirt Sleeve Cuff Fit\n\nToo Tight: The shirt has sleeves that can’t be pulled off without unbuttoning the cuffs (or popping a button). The cuffs press against the skin all the way around the wrists – and you feel like they’re “strangling” your wrists. In terms of solutions, you may want to move the button or look for a larger size instead.\n\nToo Loose: The cuffs are not only wide enough to slide loosely over a watch, but also have enough room for some fingers to go in between the cloth and your skin. Folds or wrinkles form in the cuff fabric when your arms rest against a flat surface (like a table). This means you’ll have to either size down or tighten it up with the cuff button.\n\nJust Right: The cuffs should fit close to the skin while still allowing space between the fabric and your wrists. You can easily put the shirt on or take it off without unbuttoning the cuffs and hardly any wrinkles are formed. If you wear a watch often, it’s better to size the cuffs in accordance with your watch.\n\nDress Shirt Bottom Hem Length\n\nToo Short: When the shirt is untucked, it barely covers your belt line (or the waist of your trousers). When tucked in, some parts of the hem remain exposed and might pop out when your body moves or bends. You’ll need a different brand or larger size.\n\nToo Long: The shirt tails are long enough to cover the crotch (or extend beyond it). When tucked in, any excess fabric has to be shoved between the legs to prevent bunching up. But compared to other “oversized” areas, this one isn’t a serious problem. A tailor will be able to shorten this easily.\n\nJust Right: The proper dress shirt length ends a few inches below the belt line, allowing the shirt to stay tucked in when you raise your arms. When untucked, the hem falls just far enough to cover your belt.\n\n_____________________________\n\nWritten By Antonio Centeno\nFounder, Real Men Real Style\nClick here to grab my free ebooks on men’s style\n\nThe post How a Men’s Dress Shirt Should Fit appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",

          "description": "Food52 is 10 years old! To celebrate a decade of all things kitchen and home, we're rolling out our top recipes, tips, and stories for another victory lap, along with some of our very favorite memories over the years. Go on, take 'em in!\n\nWhere would we be without cookbooks? Our favorites, new and old, occupy several shelves in our kitchen and form towers on our nightstands. Our cookbooks teach us countless skills and techniques that we use nearly every day. Cookbooks inspire us to roll up our sleeves and try new recipes, as they become increasingly dog-eared, sauce-stained, well-loved in the process. Our co-founders, Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, first met while researching and writing the Essential New York Times Cookbook. Yes, that's right—because of cookbooks, Food52 was born!\n\nAnd here we are, ten years later, still reading and cooking and learning from our cookbooks. We put on an annual tournament of cookbooks to find the year's very best one. We've even whipped up some cookbooks of our own (eleven, in fact!), gathering together our favorite recipes from Food52ers of all stripes: community members, columnists, and a few veritable Geniuses.\n \nSo to ring in our big tenth anniversary, we're looking back at all the books we've brought into the world, and recalling some of the most beloved recipes from each volume. These are the ones you've rated and reviewed the most on Food52, or cooked at home and showed off on social media.\n \nWe'll sprinkle in some of our favorite behind-the-scenes moments from along the way, too: photographs and stories, pivotal lessons learned, and all the ways the books (and we!) have grown. We'll also share with you a sneak peek of our forthcoming cookbook, Dynamite Chicken, which you can pre-order, well...now!\n\nBuckle up, because it's time for a brisk stroll down memory lane.\n\nThe Food52 Cookbook, Volumes 1 & 2\n\nTo know our first cookbooks is to know the backbone of Food52: our recipe contests. Held weekly, to start, then eventually monthly, and now quarterly, our contests helped make Food52 a gathering place for the very best home-cooked recipes, passed along from cook to cook.\n \nOur first cookbook, The Food52 Cookbook, Volume 1, celebrates this important part of Food52’s history, featuring 140 seasonal recipes that are also all previous recipe contest winners. And in addition to the recipes, the book includes profiles of community members, tips, and stories from Amanda and Merrill, and behind-the-scenes photos of the making of each dish.\n \nIn the follow up, The Food52 Cookbook, Volume 2, we published 75 all-new contest-winning recipes from our community, including even more context, tips, and tricks, plus illuminating background stories.\n\nAmanda and Merrill sifting, stirring, and testing contest recipes.  \n\nThe Most Popular Recipes From 'The Food52 Cookbook, Volumes 1 & 2'\n\n1. Secret Ingredient Beef Stew\n \nHundreds of you have made this hearty beef stew and told us how much you love it. Rather than a single \"secret ingredient,\" a \"complex mix of components\" makes this dish sing: tomatoes and tomato paste, diced vegetables, red wine and vinegar, and anchovies (the \"secret\" that takes it over the top). Amanda and Merrill recommend using richly marbled chunks of beef for the best flavor and texture.\n \n2. Double Chocolate Espresso Cookies\n \nThese bittersweet, deeply chocolatey cookies are great for grown-ups and kids alike; just don't munch on them too close to bedtime. They're crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle, with chunks of melty chocolate throughout, aka the perfect cookie. From one community member (and lucky haver of these cookies): \"Wow, wow, wow. This is the best chocolate thing I have ever made.\"\n \n3. Short Rib Ragu\n \nIn this umami-packed stew, tomato paste, anchovies, and porcini mushrooms are cooked down with wine, and in go several pounds of short ribs. The meat cooks for hours in a Dutch oven (hint: your slow cooker or Instant Pot work well here, too) until it becomes fall-apart tender, then it's topped with a zingy, herby gremolata before serving. This ragu is wonderful over pasta and polenta, or with a side salad and a big glass of red wine.\n \n4. Burnt Caramel Pudding\n \nThis rich, egg-thickened custard from community member Midge has just five ingredients, but the finesse in treating each ingredient elevates the dish to \"dinner-party fare\": First, cook down sugar until it becomes a dark amber color, then add in cream to make a caramel. After that, gently heat egg yolks to temper them, incorporate the caramel you've just made, and bake it off in a water bath to create a silky, utterly delicious pudding.\n\nGenius Recipes: 100 Recipes That Will Change the Way You Cook\n\nHere’s the cookbook that changed everything, based on our beloved, long-standing, and award-winning Genius Recipes column by Creative Director Kristen Miglore. It also kicked off an exciting new chapter of our cookbook series.\n \nGenius Recipes: 100 Recipes That Will Change the Way You Cook is packed with the smartest, most influential recipes of our time—many of which the Food52 community brought to us!—and our cooking is all the better because of it. A good number of you thought so, too, helping the book to become a New York Times bestseller.\n \nThe lessons we've learned from the book are manifold: how to amp up a humble fried egg with a touch of wine vinegar in the pan; how to make the creamiest vegetable soup without a lick of cream; and how to make the tastiest (and most interesting) kale salad we've ever tried.\n \nBut on top of all the nuggets of cooking wisdom, we learned so much about how to make a book extra beautiful—mapping out all the photos, side-by-side like the pros, and lovingly fussing with a plate of spaghetti until it looked just right.\n\nThe Most Popular Recipes from 'Genius Recipes'\n\n5. Marcella Hazan's Tomato Sauce With Onion & Butter\n \nKristen's said that this Genius sauce is the reason she started the column (and proudly on the cover of the book!), and boy, are we glad this recipe came her way. Hundreds of Food52ers have made, reviewed, and cherished this sauce, likely because of its simple ingredients, straightforward technique, and incredibly delicious, versatile results.\n \n6. Nigella Lawson's Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake\n \nRichly chocolatey? Check. Delightfully squidgy? Check. Easy as can be? Most certainly, check. Additional things to describe it: \"extraordinarily moist,\" \"a cross between a cake and pudding,\" and \"fudgy and delicious.\" If that doesn't convince you, we're not sure what will.\n\nBaking: 60 Sensational Treats You Can Pull Off in a Snap\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nSigned Copy: Food52 Baking Cookbook\n \n $23–$46 \n  More Options  Shop Now \n\nFor our next book—this time, a single-subject volume focused on baking of all stripes—we turned to our community again for the recipes (get to know all those contributors here), picking some of the most iconic baking recipes on Food52.\n \nIn this collection of 60 recipes, savory and sweet, we wanted to put together a \"handbook on back-pocket, anytime baking,\" helping baking experts and \"non-bakers\" alike see that homemade treats needn't just be reserved for special occasions. You won't have to get your hands on any special equipment or ingredients for the recipes in this book; in fact, a good number of them just call for a mixing bowl and a big wooden spoon.\n \nAnd on top of all the recipes, we sprinkled in a host of helpful tips, tricks, and baking basics: how to accurately measure flour, how to keep brown sugar soft, how to assemble and frost a cake, and more.\n \nFor a little behind-the-scenes action, take a look at our photographer James Ransom's favorite photos in the book, and check out the story behind the deliciously chocolatey magic espresso brownies on the cover, from community member ChefJune.\n\nThe Most Popular Recipes from 'Baking'\n\n7. Chocolate Dump-It Cake\n \nThis cake, originally from our co-founder, Amanda Hesser's mother, Judy, captures the true essence of this baking book: It's got a short and super-simple list of ingredients, requires just a little bit of elbow grease, and the results are rich, intensely chocolatey, and absolutely stunning. You can find it in the \"Everyday Cakes\" section in our Baking cookbook, but, hot tip: It makes for a great breakfast, straight out of the fridge. We guarantee it.\n\n8. Peach Tart\n \nThis minimalist peach tart, also by Judy Hesser via Amanda, has earned a cult following on Food52 (almost 500 of you gave us your thoughts about it!). The simplest-as-all-heck crust, made with oil, flour, sugar, and salt, gets pressed into a tart pan and layered with ripe summer peaches. Cover the whole thing in a pebbly, buttery streusel mix, and you have one of summer's greatest (and least fussy) desserts.\n\nVegan: 60 Vegetable-Driven Recipes for Any Kitchen\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nSigned Copy: Food52 Vegan Cookbook\n \n $23–$46 \n  More Options  Shop Now \n\nReleased in tandem with Baking, we set out on a similar aim with our next single-subject book, on vegan cooking: We wanted to show the world that plant-based meals are extremely delicious, and anyone can make (and love!) them. And we could think of nobody better to help us with this than Gena Hamshaw, cookbook author, nutritionist, recipe developer and food blogger, and columnist of the ever-popular New Veganism column on Food52.\n \nIn this book, Gena brought us 60 super-flavorful plant-based recipes, plus a wealth of tips on vegan cooking and eating. She showed us how to thrive by harnessing fresh, seasonal produce, supplementing with tofu, nutritional yeast, and cashew cheese (we're obsessed with it now, because of her).\n \nBy reading and cooking from this book, we became much savvier plant eaters (though we may have burnt a few sweet potatoes along the way...just like in the photo below). And by testing hundreds of recipes for it, Gena said she, too, became a better home cook.\n\nThe Most Popular Recipes from 'Vegan'\n\n9. Vegan Lentil Sloppy Joes\n \nWe'll leave it to Food52er Liesje to extol the virtues of this take on Sloppy Joes: \"As a vegan, I love hearty meals that evoke memories without trying to mimic meat. This recipe is loved by me and my omnivore guests too.\" It's cheap and cheerful, super-filling, and nutritious, too.\n \n10. Vegan Date Nut Bread\n \nThis date-nut bread does it all: It's fluffy, nutty, a little spicy, and sticky-sweet, and ready to be your breakfast or afternoon snack anyday. Better yet, it's a one-bowl recipe with ingredients you very likely have in your pantry at this very moment.\n\nA New Way to Dinner: A Playbook of Recipes and Strategies for the Week Ahead\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nSigned Copy: A New Way to Dinner, by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs\n \n $35 \n Shop Now \n\nAnyone who knows our co-founders, Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, knows that they are very busy people. But anyone who knows Amanda and Merrill knows, too, that they are master meal planners. You may be wondering: How do they make it work? Us, too. The answer: a little resourcefulness, a little ingenuity, and an arsenal of versatile, adaptable, stretch-them-for-the-whole-week recipes.\n \nLuckily for us, A&M shared their skills in our next marquee cookbook, A New Way to Dinner, a treasure trove of seasonal menus, recipes, strategies, and shopping lists, that'll let you eat well (and stress-free) for the whole week.\n \nIt goes without saying that we learned a thing or two (or a hundred) from A New Way to Dinner: Prep and cook all your fresh produce on Sunday, ahead of the week, and it'll never go to waste. A good, zingy green sauce can always transform a meal. An up-turned casserole dish with parchment on top makes a fine baking sheet stand-in. Slow-cooked pork shoulder can be used a zillion ways. The list goes on.\n\nThe test kitchen cooking something spicy while photographing 'A New Way to Dinner.' Photo by Kristen Miglore \n\nIncorporating playful props in the photo shoot.

Baked Pasta with Chicken Sausage\n \nInspired by the very Genius baked pasta from Al Forno in Providence, RI, this baked pasta can be made ahead and baked off when you're ready to eat, and it feeds a crowd. It can also be riffed dozens of ways, with different types of sausage or ground meat, vegetables of all sorts, and, of course, any melty cheese you like best.\n \n12. Chicken Fingers\n \nThese oven-baked chicken fingers are a Food52 favorite for a reason. Not only are they dang delicious, they can be repurposed in seemingly infinite (okay, at least eight) ways: chicken Parmesan, chicken Caesar salad, chicken subs, chicken ramen, chicken enchiladas...the list goes on.\n\nMighty Salads: 60 New Ways to Turn Salad into Dinner\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nStamped Copy: Food52 Mighty Salads\n \n $23–$46 \n  More Options  Shop Now \n\nWe love salad. Seriously! And we especially love bountiful, inspiring, stick-to-your ribs salad. That's why for our next single-subject book, we put together a collection of our kinds of salads, with the help of longtime Food52er and salad whisperer, EmilyC.\n \nTurns out, our kinds of salads are chock-full of grains, beans, cheeses, meats, and crispy-crunchies of all sorts. Some have leaves, and some don't. Many can be made ahead, tasting even better on days two and three. All of them have serious personality, and more importantly, staying power. All of them make room to play and riff, and virtually none of them are possible to mess up.\n \nIn addition to the recipes, the book includes our cleverest salad tips and tricks, and 50 (!) flavor-packed dressings and vinaigrettes. (And speaking of dressing, here's our little hack for making it gleam and glisten on camera.)\n\nThe Most Popular Recipes from 'Mighty Salads'\n\n13. Petits Pois À La Française Redux\n \nHello, Cover Girl! This recipe, which is featured on the cover of Mighty Salads, is also a favorite amongst the Instagram community, likely because of its beautiful green hues and (optional, but not really) jammy eggs. Delicate peas, crispy bacon, and charred scallions and Romaine lettuce come together with a creamy, tangy buttermilk–crème fraîche dressing, to create a \"understated at first, then surprisingly interesting and completely irresistible\" dish.\n \n14. Grilled Peach And Apricot Salad\n \nThis recipe is also an Instagram favorite. It's got a bit of everything: sweet and smoky grilled peaches and apricots, salty cured prosciutto, funky, creamy goat cheese, and sturdy Tuscan kale. It's one of the main reasons we can't wait for stone fruit season each year.\n\nIce Cream & Friends: 60 Recipes and Riffs\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nSigned Copy: Food52 Ice Cream & Friends\n \n $23–$46 \n  More Options  Shop Now \n\nWhat do salad and ice cream have in common? 1) We really love them. 2) They're equally easy to make. 3) They're both subjects of our companion single-subject cookbooks, released on the same day. That's right! Along with Mighty Salads came Ice Cream & Friends, because balance.\n \nIn this collection of 60 recipes—some from our community archives, and some from ice cream master, Cristina Sciarra—we set out to debunk the mysteries of ice cream (and its other frozen friends) in an approachable, straightforward, and down-right delicious way.\n \nLike our baking book, we wanted to make sure the recipes were, first off, delicious, and second, gadget-and gizmo-minimal, so pretty much anyone could get churning at a moment's notice. We also gave a whole mess of ideas for homemade toppings and riffs, because ice cream can always use a, well, friend.\n \nAnd as we put together the book, we discovered that ice cream is simply swoon-worthy (no surprises there), and actually fairly agreeable to photograph (with a few expert tips, of course).\n\nTasting burnt toast ice cream for the first time. Photo by Kristen Miglore \n\nThe Most Popular Recipes From 'Ice Cream & Friends'\n\n15. Malted Vanilla Ice Cream With Chocolate-Covered Pretzels\n \nThis is the pinnacle of ice cream: crunchy, salty-sweet, chocolate-y, and with an incredible depth of flavor because of the malt. A secret ingredient in the ice cream base makes it a churn like a dream, and keeps it from freezing too hard. Can you guess what it is?\n \n16. Saltine Cracker Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich\n \nWhat's better than an ice cream sandwich? A brownie and saltine cracker ice cream sandwich. And even better than that? When shortcut no-churn ice cream nestles between those very layers.\n\nAny Night Grilling: 60 Ways to Fire Up Dinner (& More)\n\nGrilling can be a bit intimidating. But it doesn't have to be! With a little know-how and advance planning, you can fire up a meal in no time. And who better than cookbook author, Texan, and ultra-chill griller Paula Disbrowe to show us the way?\n \nThanks to Paula, our next single-subject book was possible. Because of her—and Any Night Grilling—we now know how to get coals going in the blink of an eye, marinate before work to grill right on cue for dinner, and even make a cheeky, smoky cocktail to go with our meal. We also have 60 stellar recipes to cook over charcoal.\n \nPaula's given us all the classics we know and love, like hot dogs and juicy burgers, but has also shown us how to make freshly grilled magic from those humblest of foods, grilled bread and boneless, skinless chicken breast. And if we want to grill in the wintertime, or when the weather's not quite right, Paula's got us covered there, too.\n\nThe styling team getting the lighting *just* right Photo by Alexis Anthony \n\nProp stylist, Amanda Widis, picking the perfect set of utensils. Photo by Alexis Anthony \n\nThe Most Popular Recipes From Any Night Grilling\n\n17. Party Wings With Cholula Butter\n \nCrispy, meaty, sticky wings are the quintessential party snack. Even better when they're coated in smoky-spicy Cholula hot sauce after a trip to the grill, and a dunk in butter. These wings are a little different than your usual sports-bar fodder: Their skin is perfectly charred and crunchy, their insides are tender and light, and they're a little messy to eat, sure, but not greasy in the slightest.\n \n18. Cauliflower Steaks With Green Harissa\n \nYep, vegetarians can and should grill, too, and this impressive-as-heck cauliflower steak proves it. The deeply charred, extremely flavorful green harissa that accompanies—made of grilled tomatillos, onions, serrano chiles, and a ton of herbs—is a play on a green sauce served at Los Angeles' Gjusta. Use any leftovers for your sandwiches, eggs, and roast chickens abound.\n\nGenius Desserts: 100 Recipes That Will Change the Way You Bake\n\n exclusive \n\nFrom Our Shop\n\nSigned Copy: Genius Desserts, by Kristen Miglore\n \n $35 \n Shop Now \n\nAfter publishing 100 recipes that changed the way we cooked, Kristen knew we needed to show our baking a little love, too. So she put together 100 more life-changing recipes in the follow-up volume—this time, entirely desserts. Best of all? The Food52 community played a huge part in helping her find those little-known gems.\n \nAside from learning that you can put a whole orange in a cake, and that the best tool for this 2-ingredient dessert is...a potato (yes, really), Kristen also learned a whole lot about cooking in general, and about life itself.\n\nThe Most Popular Recipes from 'Genius Desserts'\n\n19. Ovenly's Secretly Vegan Salted Chocolate Chip Cookies\n \nNo butter? No eggs? No milk? No problem. The smartypants bakers at Ovenly discovered a way to make chewy-middled, crispy-edged chocolate chip cookies, leveraging just oil and water for moisture. These cookies taste better the longer you rest them—don't skip this step, as it makes them truly worth the wait.\n \n20. Maialino's Olive Oil Cake\n \nHow do we love thee, olive oil cake? Let us count the ways. This is truly the cake to end all cakes—rich, custardy, and pleasantly nutty from the olive oil. Top it with slow-roasted strawberries, and you have yourself a dessert that's mighty genius.\n\nDynamite Chicken: 60 Never-Boring Recipes for Your Favorite Bird\n\nWhat's for dinner tonight? If you're anything like us, the answer is probably \"chicken.\" Yep, this protein is our dinner mainstay for a reason: It's the ultimate blank canvas, taking on the flavors of any punchier companions we pair with it. But chicken's blessing is also its curse—it can get a little one-note, fast. We wanted to make sure that never happened again.\n \nThat's why we teamed up with chef and writer, Tyler Kord, to give you 60 totally not-boring, totally delicious recipes for our very favorite bird. In Dynamite Chicken, which comes out on October 8, Tyler's given us weeknight recipes and more ambitious weekend projects; party chicken and chicken to eat when we're feeling a little blue; and, perhaps most importantly, chicken that even the pickiest kids will love.\n \nTyler's also taught us how to break down and spatchcock a whole chicken, and how to cook it in a number of super-versatile ways. And throughout, his friendly voice confidently guides us—and makes us belly-laugh.\n\nCitrus-roast chicken, ready for roasting.  Photo by Brinda Ayer \n\nChicken pizza: Before and after.

Broiled Chicken Thighs With Plum Tomatoes & Garlic\n \nInspired by our co-founder, Merrill's, Braised Chicken Thighs With Plum Tomatoes & Garlic, this winning weeknight dish couldn't be simpler: Pile up juicy plum tomatoes, lots of garlic and fresh thyme, and bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs onto a sheet pan, then roast in a hot oven and broil it right at the end. The result? Crisp chicken skin, juicy dark meat, and a charred tomato–thyme sauce that's best sopped up with crusty bread.\n \n22. Roast Chicken with All of the Vegetables in Your CSA\n \nOkay, so this isn't technically a Food52-favorite recipe (at least not yet), because it's brand-spanking-new to the site. Hooray! Here's an exclusive peek at our newest book, and a chicken dish that's sure to join your regular weeknight rotation this season. All you have to do is quarter a whole chicken (or buy it in quarters), season it simply with salt and pepper, and toss it in a pan with your favorite seasonal vegetables. The coolest part? You'll stagger the veg based on their cooking times, just chucking them in the same pan as the chicken. And you'll end up with tender, juicy chicken and perfectly cooked vegetables, right in time for dinner.\n\n Which Food52 cookbook, past or future, is your fave? Let us know in the comments. \n",

Catch up on the news, sports and your favorite TV shows with a YouTube TV subscription that provides access to 70+ channels—no cable box required. Not sure what to watch? Ask your Assistant, “What’s on TV?”3. You can also enjoy other entertainment services you’re subscribed to using just your voice, including CBS All Access and Starz. 4. Stream thousands of apps from your phone to your Hub Max with built-in Cast functionality. Just open the Chromecast-enabled app on your phone and tap the Cast button.5. Enjoy millions of YouTube videos, from original content to cooking clips to how-to videos. \n6. Jam to your favorite tunes on Hub Max’s stereo speakers from services like YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and more.7. Set your favorite music service as your default listening app, so the Google Assistant will search there first when you ask it to play a song.8. Get personalized recommendations on the home screen with Face Match. Just tap the screen to see suggested videos, music, news and podcasts, just for you.9. Can’t decide which playlist or station is right to set the mood? Just say, “Hey Google, open Spotify” or “Hey Google, open YouTube Music.”10. Need a groove to get you ready for a night out?

          "description": "Baking a loaf of bread from scratch seems like the quintessential winter cooking project. The coziness of a warm kitchen and the smell of freshly-baked bread are so comforting on a cold day that it feels weird to even think about them in summertime. But believe me: if you’re new to bread making and a little intimidated by the process, you should start now, in late summer, while your house is still warm enough for dough to rise. \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to contend with in bread making, only some of which you can actually control. The ones you can’t—namely, the temperature and humidity of your kitchen—are so important to the rising process that they’re almost ingredients unto themselves. Developing your dough instincts in late summer, when those two conditions are ideal for baking, sets you up for early success rather than crushing defeat. And after a month of practicing on easy mode, you’ll be better equipped to troubleshoot recipes in the Cold Dark Times yet to come. \n\nFar too many home cooks have a mental block about homemade bread. This is a huge bummer: bread is…\n\nRead more Read\n\nThis goes for any kind of bread you could possibly want to make. Notoriously slow-rising enriched doughs like challah and brioche come to life in a slightly warm kitchen, rather than sitting like buttery rocks in the proofing bowl for hours on end as they do in the dead of winter. If you’re curious about naturally-leavened breads, those three-day-long folding, shaping, and baking processes will never be more straightforward than they are right now. But I firmly believe that bread making is only as complicated as you want it to be, and for most people, that means it’s gotta be a lot simpler than sourdough, brioche, or even an overnight no-knead bread. \n\nEnter my favorite bread recipe, which is an adaptation of Alexandra Stafford’s mom’s truly excellent Peasant Bread recipe. I will never shut up about it. This isn’t just no-knead bread—it’s same-day no-knead bread. In a roughly 72ºF kitchen, the dough rises in less than two hours; once that’s done, you scrape it into a buttered pan and let it rise again while your oven preheats. It bakes for 30-40 minutes, after which you’ll have soft, springy bread with a buttery crust—perfect for sandwiches, croutons, dipping in stews, or the last few tomato mayo toasts of the season. \n\nWhile Stafford’s recipe is basically flawless as written, over time I’ve adjusted my version to use less water, a touch more salt, and loaf pans rather than Pyrex bowls. Here’s what you’ll need to make it:\n\nA large mixing bowl\n\n3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons table salt\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar\n\n1 1/4 cups (275 grams) lukewarm water (90º-100º F)\n\n1 standard loaf pan (8 1/2” x 4 1/2” or 9” x 5”)\n\nSalted or unsalted butter, for greasing\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar until thoroughly combined. Stir in the water with a flexible spatula, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl until you can’t see any dry flour. Cover with plastic or a damp, clean towel and let rise for 1 1/2-2 hours. The dough should be bubbly, jiggly, and more than twice its original size.\n\nSet a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat it to 425ºF. Grease your loaf pan. Using the same nonstick spatula, release the dough from the sides of the bowl, pulling upwards from the bottom as you go to form a very rough ball. (Seriously, don’t sweat the shape—it’s never perfect.) Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and let rise until it peeks over the edge, another 30-45 minutes. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through so it browns evenly, then reduce the heat to 350ºF and bake for another 10-15 minutes. Immediately turn out onto a cooling rack and do your best to let it cool before slicing. You just made bread. Look at you go! \n\nI recommend making this as-is at least once or twice to get your bread legs, then messing around with it however you’d like. Sometimes I add a splash of vinegar or a few tablespoons of yogurt to the water for some tang; for pizza dough or focaccia, I’ll add a quarter cup of olive oil and extra salt. It’s possible that you’ll decide that one bread recipe is all you need, but this could also be your gateway into a bread making obsession. Either way, you’ll have at least one homemade bread recipe down cold by the time stew and braise season rolls around. \n",

          "description": "All aboard! For the entire month of September at The Points Guy, we’ll be exploring the world of train travel with reviews, features, deals and tips for maximizing your trip by rail.\n\nIt’s possible to enjoy spectacular views when traveling by air, especially during takeoff and landing. But there’s often not much to see when you’re cruising at 39,000 feet.\n\nThat’s one reason why train travel has long been one of the most popular ways to see the world. In addition to a generally more relaxed form of getting from one place to the next — no plastic bags filled with tiny toiletries or endless crowds at airport security — trains can snake through scenic mountain valleys and connect charming, remote villages. They offer steadily panning views of stunning landscapes that are sometimes exceptionally difficult to access any other way.\n\nThere are trains you have to take (like the L train in New York City) but sometimes, a journey by rail can be a trip in and of itself. We scoured the globe and spoke to expert travelers about the world’s most scenic rail routes: You know, the kind that makes you want to wax poetic like Paul Theroux. From an Amtrak train that leaves New York City every morning to an ultra-luxury locomotive that’s been transporting people to the Golden Age of Travel (and, more literally, between two South African cities) these are 11 of the most scenic train rides on Earth.\n\nIn This Post\n\nSri Lanka Railways in Sri Lanka\n\n“The ride between Kandy and Ella takes you past colorful villages, lush rolling hills, tea plantations and more,” said TPG senior writer Lori Zaino. “It’s a whole cultural experience — locals in my car were singing and clapping the entire time. For an adrenaline thrill, hang out the window (at your own risk) and watch the world go by.”\n\n(Photo by Lori Zaino / The Points Guy)\n\nThe seven-hour ride is extremely inexpensive, and a great way to explore the Sri Lankan countryside. Just be sure to opt for a second class fare so you can look out the window and enjoy the view (but not ride next to, say, livestock).\n\n(Photo by Lori Zaino / The Points Guy)\n\nBook through an agency, like Zaino did, to get your ticket secured in advance (from £13, or $I6). Though tickets purchased at the station may only be a few bucks, don’t underestimate the convenience of having a seat reserved before your arrival in Sri Lanka.\n\nPilatus Luzern in Switzerland\n\nBook any train of any type in Switzerland, and you’ll probably enjoy uninterrupted views of the Alps, charming Alpine villages and glass-like lakes. But for something a bit more adventurous, head to Alpnachstad to ride the Pilatus Luzern, which is the steepest cog railway in the world — ascending to a grade just shy of 50%, though the journey only lasts about 30 minutes.\n\nPhoto by Melanie Lieberman / The Points Guy.\n\nBut you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views from the summit of Mount Pilatus and — if you choose — opportunities to disembark and hike, climb or picnic in the surrounding mountains and valleys. Fares start at 72 Swiss Francs, or about $72.\n\nThe Northern Explorer in New Zealand\n\nFly into Auckland and board the Northern Explorer, which chugs through Hamilton, Otorohanga, National Park, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu en route to the capital, Wellington. Exploring New Zealand by rail, you’ll see everything from volcanic peaks to the rugged coast while stopping to hike the Tongariro Alpine Crossing or navigate the glowworm lit chambers of the Waitomo Caves.\n\n“Every time I’ve done the Northern Explorer train, I’ve needed to get between the two places but haven’t been in too much of a hurry,” travel writer and TPG contributor Elen Turner said. After all, the 12-hour journey isn’t exactly the fastest way to get around New Zealand. So be sure to expect a leisurely ride. Prices begin at 135 New Zealand dollars ($85) for children and 189 New Zealand dollars ($120) for adults.\n\nRocky Mountaineer in Canada\n\n“Traveling through the Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer train from Banff to Vancouver is definitely one of those ‘you-only-live-once’ experiences. It takes you through the most remote areas — ones you could never access any other way. Imagine postcard-perfect scenery in every direction,” journalist Michele Sponagle told The Points Guy. “Be prepared for a forced digital detox since you won’t get a cell signal or have onboard Wi-Fi access frequently throughout your journey.”\n\n(Photo by Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe “First Passage to the West” tour is a four-day journey from Vancouver to Banff that crosses the Continental Divide and passes through the so-called “Spiral Tunnels” carved into the Rockies. Fares start at $1,540 per person and include four meals, three nights in hotels, a tour and national park pass, as well as station transfers and luggage handling. Shorter journeys onboard the Rocky Mountaineer start around $1,2417 per person. \n\nAmtrak Adirondack Train in New York\n\nSure, there are faster ways to get to Montreal from New York City — much faster. But for travelers who are looking for an affordable way to experience the romance of train travel, the Amtrak train that runs daily between New York-Penn Station and Montreal’s Gare Centrale is a leisurely way to experience the Hudson Valley and the shores of Lake Champlain. Bonus points if you take the trip in the fall as the leaves are changing, though sadly, the train’s iconic two-level glass-domed passenger car was just retired. Just remember, this isn’t a luxury experience, so bring a good book, pack a favorite lunch, and don’t even think about relying on Wi-Fi. Prices start at $70 one-way.\n\nBelmond Andean Explorer in Peru\n\nFor both stunning views and gorgeous interiors, opt for a luxury Belmond sleeper train experience, such as the Andean Explorer, which travels from Cusco to Puno, on Lake Titicaca, and the gleaming white stone city of Arequipa.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Belmond.\n\nNo comforts have been overlooked onboard, and the train is even fitted with oxygen tanks and masks for passengers who find the high altitude uncomfortable. Bunk bed cabins with two single beds are available from $3,900 (double occupancy) and include all onboard meals, as well as pre-dinner cocktails and canapés; tours; and transportation too the airport upon arrival in Arequipa.\n\nAmtrak Pacific Surfliner in California\n\nThis summer, TPG’s Mommy Points, Summer Hull, boarded the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner from Anaheim to San Diego.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Amtrak)\n\nDepending on which direction you’re heading, you’ll want to carefully select a seat on the “surf” side of the train, which hugs the coastline as it works its way back and forth between the Los Angeles area and San Diego nearly a dozen times every day. Prices start around $30 each way.\n\nBlue Train in South Africa\n\nSince the 1920s, South Africa’s Blue Train has been carrying travelers between Pretoria — near Johannesburg — and Cape Town in luxurious cars with panoramic windows (best for admiring the passing vineyards and major attractions like Table Mountain).\n\n“I took the Blue Train back in 2012 with a South African friend,” recalled Nadine Jolie Courtney, a luxury travel advisor with Elite Travel International. “I can’t imagine a more spectacular way to see the South African countryside . . . It felt like being transported back in time to an elevated, bygone era of travel, with white tablecloths, private ensuite bathrooms (complete with tubs!), a dress code for dinner and jaw-droppingly gorgeous scenery . . . The night sky was particularly memorable. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen so many stars, and it felt as if the whole of the Milky Way was visible.” Rates start at 18,405 South African rand, or about $1,212.\n\nDurango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Colorado\n\n“I’ll never forget the unique Colorado vistas, cliffs and being surprised by what was around the next bend,” recalled Swanette Smith (aka Grandma Points). \n\n(Photo by Roxanne Davis.)\n\nRide a vintage coal-fired, steam-powered locomotive and enjoy stunning views as you crisscross the Animas River, navigate the San Juan National Forest and hug the sheer edge of the mountains. “[It’s] short, very scenic,” said TPG’s executive news director Scott Mayerowitz, who said the 45-mile, three-and-a-half hour ride is really about the views, not the destination. Prices start at $69 for adults and $42 for children in the off-season. \n\nShinkansen in Japan \n\nIn addition to reliable service and ultra-clean cars, a ride on Japan’s bullet train is a great way to see the country’s scenery while traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto. “On my way … I enjoyed a beautiful view of [mountains] and Japanese towns and, if you’re lucky, you can spot the famous Mount Fuji,” said Adrianna Qi, TPG’s paid social associate. (If you’re originating in Tokyo, watch for the mountain to appear about 40 minutes into the journey — and be sure to snag a seat on the right side of the train.) Both Qi and TPG’s senior executive assistant, Christie Matsui, said that you’ll want to be sure to pick up a bento box at the train station beforehand. Seven-day Japan Rail passes begin at 29,110 yen, or $273. A one-way ticket to Kyoto from Tokyo can cost 13,080 yen, or $123.\n\nJacobite Steam Train in Scotland\n\n“Aboard the Jacobite Steam Train, which played the role of the Hogwarts Express in the “Harry Potter” movies, passengers feel like they’re on their way to Hogwarts,” Canadian travel writer and photographer Johanna Read told TPG. “Starting at the base of Scotland’s highest mountain, Ben Nevis, the train passes by Scotland’s moors and lochs and then slows for photos as it traverses the 21 arches of the curved Glenfinnan Viaduct also featured in the films. The end of the line is the pretty seaside town of Mallaig, rather than Hogsmeade.” \n\n(Photo by Darren Murph / The Points Guy)\n\nRead recommends that travelers on a budget consider the “less magical” ScotRail train, which follows an identical route. “You can [even] take a photo of the Jacobite engine as it departs from Mallaig before hopping back aboard your own train,” Read said. Prices start at $28 for children and $50 for adults.\n\nMaximizing Train Travel\n\nIt can be harder to redeem points for train travel through Cape Winelands than for a flight, but it’s not especially tricky to maximize booking your adventure. If you’re booking a trip on one of the iconic Amtrak routes in the US, such as the Adirondack or Pacific Surfliner, earning and using points is still very much an option on the table either via Amtrak Rewards or fixed-value points program.\n\nThe Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and Chase Sapphire Preferred Card will both earn you 2x on your train trips, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Citi Premier both earn 3x on travel.\n\nBuilt-in credit card protections are also still relevant when booking an adventure by train.\n\nStay tuned to TPG throughout the month for lots of additional train-related content as we walk through train travel award redemptions, maximization strategies, reviews, stories from the rails, routes and more.\n\nSign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more travel tips! \n\nFeature photo by Darren Murph / The Points Guy.",

          "description": "There are thousands of companies listed on US stock exchanges. With that many stock tickers to keep track of, it’s no surprise that people sometimes make mistakes when buying shares. These screw-ups cost investors—in transaction fees and embarrassment—when they have to undo the trades.\n\nTwo professors at the Rutgers School of Business-Camden, in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Financial Markets, found that more than half of listed US companies share a “meaningful part” of their names or tickers with another firm, often in a separate industry and with a dramatically different market capitalization. Of that group, there are around 250 company pairs where the possibility of confusion is particularly high, and a quarter of these showed statistically significant similarities in trading patterns that can only be explained by cases of mistaken identity.\n\nTake Ford Motor, which has the stock ticker F. There’s also a consumer goods firm called Forward Industries, which has the stock ticker FORD. Forward Industries, which has a market capitalization of around $10 million versus Ford Motor’s $36 billion, sees its share purchases balloon when Ford makes a splash. These sorts of co-movements account for 5% of trades for the smaller companies in the pairs, a share that “indicates that confusion trading is not driven only by retail investors,” the professors write. Undoing the trades costs at least $1.1 million in yearly transaction fees for the most affected pairs. The effects of mistaken trades often take a week to fade away.\n\nCommon name/ticker mix-ups\n\nLarger company (Ticker)\nSmaller company (Ticker)\nMarket cap difference: Big vs small\n\nFord Motor Company (F)\nForward Industries (FORD)\n347,079%\n\nZions Bancorporation (ZION)\nZion Oil (ZN)\n26,439%\n\nR1 RCM (RCM)\nRCM Technologies (RCMT)\n3,215%\n\nAmerican Software Inc (AMSWA)\nAmerican Shared Hospital Services (AMS)\n2,883%\n\nM.D.C. Holdings (MDC)\nMDC Partners (MDCA)\n1,288%\n\nOne spectacular example was when, as the researchers document, the stock price of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group surged by more than 1,000% on Oct. 4, 2013. The company traded under the ticker TWTRQ, and social media giant Twitter had just filed plans for its IPO—it listed the following month, with the ticker TWTR.\n\nThe researchers note the phenomenon of name and ticker confusion is more common than the issue known as “fat finger trades,” when the wrong shares are bought due to an accidentally mistyped key. And the best way to avoid confusion between similarly named company pairs is easy enough: the researchers found that when companies changed their names or tickers, the abnormal trading patterns vanished.\n",

          "description": "Although we’ve seen some incredible cash deals to Hawaii recently, nothing beats paying just $11.20 out of pocket for a round-trip to Hawaii. However, while there’s no shortage of mileage options between the US mainland and Hawaii, not many of them are cheap.\n\nBut there’s an award sweet spot that just got even sweeter thanks to a new transfer bonus. Now through October 1, you’ll get a 40% bonus when transferring American Express Membership Rewards to Aer Lingus Avios, British Airways Avios or Iberia Avios.\n\nThis transfer bonus sweetens all kinds of sweet spots in the Avios award chart, and recently we’ve been diving into the best of these sweet spots. So far, we’ve shown you how to fly to Ireland for 10,000 points each way or try out American Airlines lie-flat business class seats for just 12,000 points each way.\n\nToday, we’ll focus on how you can fly to Hawaii for just 19,000 Membership Rewards points round-trip.\n\nIn This Post\n\nThe Sweet Spot\n\nMost airlines’ award charts price award flights based on the origin and destination regions. For example, American Airlines’ award chart prices economy award flights from anywhere in the continental US to Hawaii for 22,500 miles one-way for MileSAAver awards — although it may sometimes charge less through its Economy Web Special deals.\n\nInstead of this region-based award pricing, British Airways’ award chart is based on the distance of the flight. And lucky for us award travelers, British Airways is a partner with American Airlines and Alaska Airlines so you can use British Airways Avios to book mileage flights to Hawaii on both of the US-based carriers.\n\nMost flights between the US West Coast and Hawaii are under 3,000 miles in distance, and British Airways charges 13,000 Avios each way — or 26,000 Avios round-trip — for nonstop award flights between 2,001 and 3,000 miles. Each individual award flight is priced separately, so you’re going to want to focus on nonstop flight options when possible.\n\nAmerican Express Membership Rewards need to be transferred to partners in increments of 1,000 points. So, during the 40% transfer bonus, you’ll need to transfer 10,000 points to get enough for a one-way (with 1,000 Avios remaining) or 19,000 points for a round-trip (with 600 Avios left over).\n\nRoutes\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nAA flies to four different destinations in Hawaii from three of its US hubs: Los Angeles (LAX), Phoenix (PHX) and Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW). While DFW to Hawaii is more than 3,000 miles, all eight of the routes from LA and Phoenix to Hawaii qualify for the 13,000 Avios sweet spot:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) — Honolulu, Oahu (HNL)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) — Lihue, Kauai (LIH)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) — Kahului, Maui (OGG)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) — Kailua/Kona, Hawaii (KOA)\n\nPhoenix (PHX) — Honolulu, Oahu (HNL)\n\nPhoenix (PHX) — Lihue, Kauai (LIH)\n\nPhoenix (PHX) — Kahului, Maui (OGG)\n\nPhoenix (PHX) — Kailua/Kona, Hawaii (KOA)\n\nImage generated using Great Circle Mapper.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nSeattle-based Alaska Airlines boasts “over 175 weekly flights to Hawaii” departing from nine different US gateways to four Hawaiian destinations. I count a total of 27 individual routes that fall under the 3,000-mile threshold for this redemption, and here’s a rundown of your options organized by the four airports in Hawaii:\n\nTo Honolulu, Oahu (HNL) from:\nAnchorage (ANC)\nLos Angeles (LAX)\nOakland (OAK)\nPortland (PDX)\nSan Diego (SAN)\nSan Francisco (SFO)\nSan Jose (SJC)\nSeattle (SEA)\n\nTo Kahului, Maui (OGG) from:\nAnchorage (ANC)\nLos Angeles (LAX)\nOakland (OAK)\nPortland (PDX)\nSacramento (SMF)\nSan Diego (SAN)\nSan Francisco (SFO)\nSan Jose (SJC)\nSeattle (SEA)\n\nTo Lihue, Kauai (LIH) from:\nOakland (OAK)\nPortland (PDX)\nSan Diego (SAN)\nSan Jose (SJC)\nSeattle (SEA)\n\nTo Kailua/Kona (KOA) from:\nOakland (OAK)\nPortland (PDX)\nSan Diego (SAN)\nSan Jose (SJC)\nSeattle (SEA)\n\nHere’s a map of 25 of these routes — chopping out service from Anchorage (ANC):\n\nImage generated using Great Circle Mapper.\n\nSearching Award Availability\n\nThe best place to find award availability for all of these flights is on American Airlines’ website. Since it partners with Alaska Airlines, you will get both AA and Alaska award results. Remember that AA has two different award searching tools and each can return different results. I’d recommend using the old search tool for this search as you’ll want to be able to limit the results to MileSAAver awards.\n\nTo do that, you’ll want to choose “non-stop only” from the drop-down and choose “Economy MileSAAver” tab if the route is showing Economy Web Special availability.\n\nHow to Book\n\nNow that you know the routes, you might be wondering how to take advantage of this opportunity. Thankfully, we have step-by-step instructions on how to do so (click here).\n\nFirst, make sure that you find award availability before transferring points. Then, to transfer points, log in to your American Express account, navigate to the point transfer page and select “Transfer Points” under the British Airways Avios tile. In our experience, Amex Membership Rewards transfer to British Airways Executive Club instantaneously. You’ll want to transfer 10,000 MR points to get enough Avios for a one-way award or 19,000 points for a round-trip.\n\nOnce the Avios are in your account, search for the award flight you found on British Airways’ website, select your flight option from the search results and then click “Continue” at the bottom. Read and agree to the terms on the next page, clicking “Continue” again to progress. On the next page, your personal information should be populated from your account profile. Update as needed and click “Continue” again. On the final page, complete your payment information to finalize the booking.\n\nUnfortunately, not all American Airlines award flights are showing up on BA’s website. For some reason, BA isn’t showing any redeye flights back from Hawaii in the search results. While you still should be able to book these flights when calling BA, it may be worth checking with a BA phone agent that the award flights are available before transferring your points.\n\nAlso, Alaska awards aren’t searchable or bookable through British Airways’ website. For both of these types of awards, you’re going to need to search award availability on AA’s website and then call BA to book these awards.\n\nRemember to use a credit card with trip delay and baggage insurance protection. Top choices are the Citi Prestige® Card ($500 per passenger for 6+ hour delay) for bookings made before September 22, the Chase Sapphire Reserve ($500 per ticket for 6+ hour or overnight delay), Chase Sapphire Preferred Card ($500 per ticket for 12+ hour or overnight delay) and the Citi Premier℠ Card (12+ hour delay) for bookings made before September 22.\n\nEarning Points\n\nSince this transfer bonus only runs for two months, the promotion is going to be best for those who already have Membership Rewards points already in their account. But if you don’t have points in your Amex account — or want to resupply after taking advantage of this deal — here are three great credit card welcome bonuses that are currently available:\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express: 60,000-point welcome bonus for spending $5,000 in the first three months of Card Membership (also check the CardMatch tool for a possible targeted 100,000-point bonus; targeted offer subject to change at anytime).\n\nThe Business Platinum® Card from American Express: Up to 75,000-point welcome bonus: 50,000 bonus points after you spend $10,000 and an extra 25,000 bonus points after you spend an additional $10,000 all on qualifying purchases within your first 3 months of Card Membership.\n\nAmerican Express® Gold Card: 35,000-point welcome bonus for spending $2,000 in the first three months of card membership (also check the CardMatch tool for a possible targeted 50,000-point bonus; targeted offer subject to change at anytime).\n\nBottom Line\n\nFlying between the mainland US and Hawaii using British Airways Avios has long been an award sweet spot. Thanks to the 40% transfer bonus for transferring American Express Membership Rewards points to British Airways Avios, you’re now able to book round-trip award flights for even less, paying just 19,000 Amex points and $11.20 in taxes and fees. Just make sure that you transfer MR points to Avios by October 1, 2019 to take advantage of this transfer bonus.\n\nFeatured image by anyaberkut via Getty Images",

          "description": "Jeff Bezos is making a name for himself in the world of charity. | Nicole Craine/WireImage\n\nIs that good? Is that bad? It’s definitely unusual.\n \nWhen starting Amazon more than two decades ago, Jeff Bezos decided to build a reputation as an aggressive micromanager.\n\nWhen starting the Day One Families Fund, his new billion-dollar charity, Bezos decided to try something remarkably different.\n\nJust after he became the world’s richest man one year ago, Bezos, who had until then been conspicuously absent from the world of serious charitable giving, announced that he would give $2 billion to bolster homelessness services and early childhood education in the US. He quickly sent $100 million to two dozen well-regarded nonprofits working to provide shelter to homeless families across the country.\n\nAnd since then, he has done something that even the nonprofits receiving his millions remark is highly unusual: He has given them life-changing money with virtually no restrictions, formal vetting, or oversight, according to Recode’s interviews with eight of those funded by him and others familiar with his donations.\n\nFunders of Bezos’s stature typically cast an open call for proposals, spending months poring over applications from nonprofits and sometimes insisting on site visits, interviews, and reams of financial data. Bezos’s team instead quietly cold-called the nonprofits he was already interested in backing, asked them for a few 500-word answers, and then wired them millions of dollars in cash or Amazon shares within about six weeks of making initial contact.\n\nFunders require nonprofits to fill out reports as often as every quarter, outlining the recipients progress on the funder’s own favorite dozen-plus metrics. Bezos does require an annual report, but he doesn’t even send a rubric; nonprofits can effectively create their own accountability and send him whatever type of update they want.\n\nFunders are also prone to placing copious restrictions on their money to ensure it is spent on whatever it is they care about. What does Bezos do? He’s taken “no strings attached” to the extreme, effectively letting the nonprofits spend the money on anything that offers shelter to homeless families, even if the initiative was nowhere to be found on the original applications or grant agreements.\n\nThat all might sound pretty wild. Giving $100 million to nonprofits based on little provided information and then letting them run with it sounds, on its face, like a recipe for disaster. It conjures the image of fat-and-happy charity leaders milking extravagant salaries from others’ generosity, or profligate spending on extraneous overhead — or even outright fraud, such as when the head of the United Way embezzled $1.2 million from his foundation.\n\nTo be sure, Bezos’s approach is a wonderful arrangement for the nonprofits. Almost too wonderful. Big money, little accountability, and the marketing power of the world’s wealthiest man to boot? Of course they rave about it.\n\n“It may seem kind of crazy to have this rare opportunity and to not have the intensive oversight you’d typically expect with a funder,” said Vera Beech, who runs Community Rebuilders, a homeless shelter group based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “But for us, it’s absolutely a dream come true.”\n\n“It may seem kind of crazy to have this rare opportunity and to not have the intensive oversight you’d typically expect with a funder”\n\nBut for everyone else?\n\nWell, here’s the surprise: Multiple experts told Recode this strategy actually makes a lot of sense. They think philanthropies should give nonprofits substantially more leeway.\n\nRisks abound, to be sure. The swiftness with which Bezos is parting with the money could backfire — and it does also contradict some of his public rhetoric about his approach to giving.\n\n“There [are] a lot of mishaps, a lot of problems, that can occur if there’s not adequate oversight,” said Daniel Borochoff, who advocates for more accountability as the head of CharityWatch. “If someone was stealing from an Amazon warehouse, I’m sure his people would be all over it. But if people were stealing from the shelter pantry, the mission-focused charity staff and volunteers might not.”\n\nOne nonprofit leader who received millions from the Day One Fund said he felt Bezos’s approach was “puzzling.”\n\n“There is no one that we partner with — that would fund us — that is this hands-off. Especially at this significant level of funding,” the leader said. “It’s very different from our typical funding relationships, you bet.”\n\nBezos representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe Amazon founder has indicated he intends to be more hands-on with his other billion dollar initiative, a preschool program that Bezos has said, “I’m going to be operating.” He considers the homelessness program “a more traditional grant-making” model. \n\nBut the entire world is scrutinizing Bezos’s first serious foray into charity, both because of his new figurehead power as the world’s wealthiest person and because of how parsimonious he has historically been with his donations. The Amazon founder, along with his then-wife MacKenzie, have long countered that they did not want to rush into philanthropy — and have been willing to take withering criticism in order to avoid knee-jerk donations.\n\nJeff Bezos said little about his philanthropic giving until confronted with questions from the New York Times in the summer of 2017, after he tweeted a “request for ideas” just before briefly becoming the richest person in the world for the first time. He then spent 15 months mulling those ideas before announcing the Day One Fund. \n\n“I have a lot of ideas about philanthropy — that I’m not ready to share or talk about,” Bezos told Charlie Rose nine years ago when asked whether he would consider signing the Giving Pledge (he still hasn’t). “There are a lot of interesting unknowns. And sometimes I think we try to solve problems before we understand the problem.”\n\n“What would you do if we gave you $5 million?”\n\nThe lack of accountability built into Bezos’s system places an enormous amount of weight on the front end: If you’re going to give nonprofits an exceedingly long leash, you’ve got to make sure you choose the right nonprofits in the first place.\n\nBut the strangeness of Bezos’s philanthropy begins with the way he chose his first two dozen nonprofits.\n\nFor Beth Vann-Turnbull, the head of Housing Families First near Richmond, Virginia, it began with three missed calls while she was on vacation.\n\nThe calls came from Paul Dauber, Bezos’s personal lawyer, who, despite not working for the philanthropy, has been the primary point of contact for nonprofits like Housing Families First. He asked leaders like Vann-Turnbull an easy question: How would you like to be considered for a grant of up to $5 million?\n\n“This must be going to everyone in the country who works in homeless services,” Vann-Turnbull recalls thinking.\n\nTo a person, these calls came completely out of the blue. They had an air of mystery. But behind the scenes at the Day One Fund, an advisory board of a dozen experts on homelessness had culled together this list from their personal networks.\n\nThis was not a typical open process, where a foundation posts a public call for proposals and patiently works through the submissions. Observers have noted there’s a risk that an elite group of informants could be biasing Bezos’s work toward their favored projects, rather than honestly and comprehensively assessing who exactly has the best idea. (Bezos has praised his advisory board as “experts” in the field.)\n\nEven the invited applicants were nervous. Bezos was asking for a proposal within two weeks. Often, nonprofits can spend months laboring over every decimal point on a grant application, and for far smaller grants than $5 million.\n\nLucky for them, Bezos wasn’t asking for much: just a few general questions about their nonprofits and then, quite starkly, a 500-word answer about how they’d spend the money.\n\n“I’ll apply for a grant for $5,000 and it’s five times the length of this one,” said Darlene Newsom, who runs UMOM New Day Centers, a nonprofit that operates homeless shelters in Phoenix. “I was a little bit in awe about it.”\n\nNearly every grantee who spoke with Recode called the abridged process “unusual.”\n\n“I wouldn’t even call it an application. It was a back-of-the-envelope idea,” said one person who received money. “‘What would you do if we gave you $5 million? Okay! You’re in!’ It was quite strange.”\n\n“‘What would you do if we gave you $5 million? Okay! You’re in!’ It was quite strange.”\n\nThere would be no other questions after that five-page application. No site visits. No interviews. The next time they’d hear from Bezos’s staff, the only question was whether they’d like their donation in cash or Amazon stock. A lump sum payment arrived just before Thanksgiving.\n\n“I would love for Jeff Bezos to be there.” But don’t count on it.\n\nThat brings us to the next way in which the Day One Fund radically differs from the charity orthodoxy: Bezos basically vanished from the day-to-day experience of the nonprofits since handing them the money. That’s not unprecedented, but charity leaders say they’ve rarely, if ever, seen a donor of this size be so absent.\n\nHe has no minders routinely checking in with the 24 executive directors of the nonprofits he backed. In fact, with no full-time staff working exclusively on the billion-dollar project, Bezos has largely outsourced his non-legal interactions with his charities to a trade group, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, which has organized a few calls and meetings at conferences between various grantees, the nonprofits told Recode.\n\nThat’s left some longing for more direct interactions with Bezos’s team, which can sometimes be unresponsive to their outreach, sources say, and hasn’t seized on some open invitations from multiple grantees to their homeless shelters (which isn’t terribly uncommon).\n\nThere’s a practical reason these nonprofits want to show off for Bezos: This lack of a real relationship is a missed opportunity for them to secure future funding from Bezos down the line, multiple leaders told Recode.\n\nOther nonprofits just want to establish even a scintilla of a personal connection with the billionaire who gave their organization its largest gifts ever.\n\nNewsom said her board members have even taken to sending handwritten personal cards to Bezos’s house to say thanks. She’s planning to invite Bezos to their annual gala in October.\n\n“I would love for Jeff Bezos to be there,” she said.\n\nWhat if Jeff Bezos is right?\n\nAll signs at this point indicate that Bezos has little interest in overseeing their gala from the dais — or overseeing anything at all, really.\n\nBezos’s team’s lack of engagement reflects his broader strategy to effectively hand the nonprofits the money and get out of the way.\n\nTo say this is far from how typical funders like to do things is an understatement. Governments especially love to attach endless conditions to the money they disburse, part of a conventional wisdom baked in the 1980s that bloated nonprofits were not spending nearly enough of their funding on programming and that more supervision could help combat fraud.\n\nAnd despite escalating criticism from nonprofit leaders and academics about attaching these strings, donors continue to dangle money that comes with conditions upon conditions upon conditions.\n\nVu Le, a nonprofit leader who runs an influential blog on philanthropy issues, told Recode that donors’ obsessive focus on overhead costs serves to “infantilize” nonprofits. He compared his industry’s conundrum to volunteer firefighters arriving at the scene of a blaze.\n\n“Every three or four steps, people want to make sure the money I’m giving you is spent on the water or on the hose. I also want to make sure that any of the money isn’t spent on the rent for your fire station,” Le said. “We spend all this time trying to answer these stupid questions that we’re not fighting the fires.”\n\n“We spend all this time trying to answer these stupid questions that we’re not fighting the fires”\n\nTo be clear, the Bezos money has to be spent on family homelessness measures, but there are very few restrictions under that umbrella. The grant agreements that Bezos and the nonprofits signed do not legally limit how they spend the money, and multiple nonprofits told Recode that they’ve changed some of their plans after receiving Bezos’s gifts.\n\n“This is really the most flexible funding that we’ve ever had,” said Beech. “I could understand that some people would look for that traditional response. For us, we’re like, ‘Welcome to the modern world.’”\n\nFor example, rather than splicing the money in a series of payments, nonprofits received all the money at once. If they wanted to spend it all right away on a new fancy building, they could.\n\nAnother example: In June, the grantees submitted their first annual report to the Bezos fund. Reporting is drudgery in the world of charities, with each funder asking for their own idiosyncratic metrics to be met with on own forms, no matter how much money they actually gave. Funders can ask for reports as often as every quarter.\n\nBezos let his nonprofits send in whatever report they wanted. No form.\n\nIf any of the 24 nonprofits — or the hundreds of others that Bezos will likely choose over the next decade — flops fantastically, critics will be quick to point out that this lack of accountability was a rookie mistake. Some may even call out the other Seattle-based tech billionaire, Bill Gates, who was criticized as too trusting of nonprofits in the early years of his philanthropic efforts. Gates changed course and now requires his grantees to go through a careful vetting process.\n\nBut to many experts in the nonprofit space, the hope is that Bezos’s emerging strategy will challenge the conventional wisdom that a long leash is a bad thing for a nonprofit. Old-guard philanthropy may snicker, but so did the other sectors that Bezos has decimated during his reign at Amazon. \n\nAnd the egg is on their face, not his.\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

          "description": "Last month, the Society of Actuaries (a group I was born to belong to!) published a mammoth (84-page) report entitled “Viability of the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy”. Despite its opaque title, this report (written by Steve Vernon, Joe Tomlinson, and the estimable Wade Pfau) contains some interesting info about planning for retirement income.\n\nOn the surface, this report's advice seems stupid simple: To optimize retirement income, delay Social Security and make the most of required minimim distributions from tax-advantaged accounts. Isn't this pretty much what most of us plan to do? Maybe so, but I doubt that anyone else has crunched the numbers like this.\n\nPlus, this strategy provides a specific plan for folks who haven't considered how to approach retirement income. As the authors note, most retirees fall into two camps.\n\nThere are the people who are scared to spend their savings, so they sacrifice current lifestyle.\n\nThere are those who “wing it”, spending without a plan.\n\nThe Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy is useful for both groups. It shows the specific steps needed to maximize retirement income. Those steps might seem obvious to those of us who read and write about personal finance every day, but they are not obvious to our family and friends.\n\nHere's a quick overview of the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy (or SSiRS).\n\nThe Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy\n\nVernon, Tomlinson, and Pfau introduced the concept of the SSiRS in their 2017 report through the Stanford Center on Longevity: “Optimizing Retirement Income by Integrating Retirement Plans, IRAs, and Home Equity”. (You can download a PDF of the paper from Stanford.)\n\n“This strategy has a significant advantage,” they wrote. “It can be readily implemented from virtually any IRA or 401(k) plan without purchasing an annuity.”\n\nThat 2017 publication was mostly theoretical. There wasn't a lot of info on how to approach their strategy from a practical perspective. This new project is more about actual implementation.\n\nThey write:\n\nThe SSiRS includes two key steps:\n\n1. Optimize expected Social Security benefits through a careful delay strategy; in this case, many middle-income retirees may have all the guaranteed lifetime income they need.\n\n2. Generate retirement income from savings using the IRS required minimum distribution (RMD) rules, coupled with a low-cost index fund, target date fund, or balanced fund.\n\nThe authors stress that the SSiRS is meant to be a baseline strategy, a starting point from which retirees (and/or their financial advisors) can build a more customized plan. It's like a basic bread recipe that yields good results every time. If you want to make fancier bread, you're free to do so. But you don't have to.\n\nLet's look at these two key steps in more detail.\n\nOptimizing Social Security Benefits\n\nIn the November 2017 study in which they introduced the SSiRS, the authors discussed the power of Social Security payments. They suggest that Social Security can act as an annuity replacement. (With an annuity, you pay an insurance company a lump sum. They turn around and issue you regular payments. I don't know much about them, honestly.)\n\nBut a lot of new retirees don't understand the power of patience. They're eager to access benefits now, so they draw on Social Security as soon as they're able. As a result, they receive far less than they could.\n\nThe authors argue that:\n\nThe optimal way to increase retirement income is to delay tapping into Social Security and personal savings until age 70. Have an income source until then. (This simply reinforces research into the power of working longer.)\n\nThe next-best option is to use a portion of your savings for living expenses, but still delay Social Security benefits as long as possible. The obvious downside to this approach is that it depletes your capital.\n\nThe authors also looked at using reverse mortgages to smooth monthly income in retirement. Although not appropriate for all circumstances, a reverse mortgage can be a useful tool for some retirees.\n\nUltimately, there's no one right solution. Everyone's situation is different. But undestanding the tools available and optimal solutions can help you figure out the retirement income strategy that works best for you. In most cases, however, you'll want to delay taking Social Security benefits as long as possible.\n\nGenerating Retirement Income from Savings\n\nTheir new paper suggests several ways to generate retirement income from savings. The authors propose a three-pronged approach.\n\nFirst, establish an emergency fund. If your goal is to live on a steady, predictable stream of income in retirement, then unplanned expenses are your enemy. An emergency fund prevents you from tapping into the capital you're using for your regular income. Your emergency fund should be in something like a certificate of deposit or a savings account.\n\nNext, set up a “retirement transition fund”. This fund is meant to provide a small stream of income before you enter full retirement, the state where you're no longer working for money. Most people enjoy a phase of semi-retirement, during which they're working less and living more. For young retirees especially, this money doesn't have to be in your primary retirement account(s) (although it could be). It just needs to be deliberately differentiated the money you'll eventually use for regular retirement income.\n\nFinally — and most importantly — take your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. This is a non-optional step, obviously (thus the word “required”), but it's important to plan. Understand how your RMDs fit into your retirement income stream.\n\nBecause RMDs don't start until age 70-1/2, the authors have calculated faux RMDs for younger retirees. They've worked backward to age 60. If, like me, you're only 50 and want to implement their approach, you'll have to to some math of your own. (But if you're 50 and retired, you probably have the time and motivation to do this on your own!)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe full paper covers the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy in much greater detail, obviously. It also addresses topics like uneven expense flows in retirement (also known as: my life), unexpected income flows, “alternative health scenarios”, and investment considerations.\n\nHow should the RMD portion of income be invested with this strategy? That's a great question!\n\nIn one of these papers (I don't remember which, sorry), the authors write that Social Security can be viewed as the bond portion of your investment portfolio. Plus, Social Security tends to make up a significant portion of most people's retirement income.\n\nBecause of this, it's possible to be more aggressive with the portfolio from which you'll be withdrawing RMDs. A stock-heavy approach has the advantage of increasing expected retirement income — but it does increase volatility too.\n\nIn the world of financial independence and early retirement, there's a lot of discussion about safe-withdrawal rates. How much can a person reasonably expect to draw from her investments each year without risk of running out of money?\n\nThis is an important question, and there's no easy answer.\n\nMost folks in the early retirement community plan for their financial futures using some the so-called four-percent rule (or some variation of it). This rule guideline, first put forth in 1994 by financial adviser William Bengen, says that, generally speaking, it's safe to withdraw 4% from your investment portfolio every year without risk of running out of money. There's a lot of debate about whether 4% is the magic number — or 3.5% or 4.5% or something else — but there's no debate about the general concept.\n\nMini-rant: For some reason, folks in the early retirement community have decided that the 4% rule originated with the “Trinity Study”, an article published in the February 1998 issue of the Journal of the American Association of Individual Investors. This is incorrect. It makes the FIRE movement as a whole look bad when adherents keep claiming this. If we can't get simple, verifiable facts right, then why should people trust us on the bigger, more important stuff?\n\nBut how do retirement withdrawals actually work? How should they be structured? How does Social Security fit into all of this? There's far less talk about the practical implementation of retirement spending strategies than there is advocacy for the four-percent rule.\n\nThat's why I like to see research like this. The Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy might seem simplistic, but if's an actual plan for retirement spending rather than an abstract model based on past market results. It's a real-world tool that's useful to everyone, both people pursuing traditional retirement and those who want to retire early.\n\nThe post The Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",

          "description": "Winner-Take-All Phenomenon Rules the Stock Market, Too\nAny gains are attributable to a relative handful of companies.\nBloomberg, July 29, 2019\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe winner-take-all phenomenon is well-documented among sports stars, pop singers, fiction authors, actors and hedge-fund managers — those at the top reap fabulous rewards while everyone else scrapes to get by.\n\nIt turns out the same hold true in the stock market: Just 1.3 percent of the world’s public companies account for all the market gains during the past three decades. Outside the U.S., the gains are even more concentrated, with less than 1% of all equities driving all of the net appreciation in share prices.\n\nThose numbers come from a new study on equities, and how their gains are distributed. Ardent stock pickers who read the paper might find themselves turned into indexers as a result of what they see.\n\nThe lead author of the paper, Hendrik Bessembinder of the Carey School of Business at Arizona State University,1 and the rest of his research team looked at 62,000 global common stocks from 1990 to 2018, and ranked them on a compounded, total-return basis. That period includes two decade-long market expansions, from 1990 to 2000 and 2009 through 2018, as well as two major market crashes in 2000 and 2008. These periods, encompassing bear and bull cycles, make it less likely that the findings are due to anomalies or one-off events.\n\nThe data analysis reveals the net gains for equities can be found in a small group of outliers — and much fewer in number than is commonly thought of by most market participants.\n\nJust five companies — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.Com Inc., Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Exxon Mobil Corp. — accounted for 8.3% of global net wealth creation. It is hard to imagine a greater example of the winner-take-all distribution — these five companies account for just 0.008% of the total sample set of 62,000 publicly traded companies. Expand that to the top 0.5%, or 306 companies, and they account for 73% of global net wealth creation. The best performing 811 companies (1.33% of the total) accounted for all net global wealth creation.\n\nLet’s translate those percentages into dollar amounts: During that 1990-2018 period, those companies accounted for the entire net stock market appreciation of $44.7 trillion, in excess of Treasury returns. Outside the U.S., less than 1% of international equities generated $16 trillion in capital appreciation, also in excess of Treasury returns.\n\nLess than half of the stocks in the study — 23,905 — had cumulative positive returns. When added to the top gainers, these stocks generated $66.6 trillion of wealth. However, a majority of stocks — 37,195, or 60.9% — were net money losers, subtracting a $21.83 trillion from the total. The total gains of winners minus losers netted out to that $44.7 trillion figure.\n\nConcentration of stock returns was not the original focus of the research; ironically, the study sought to determine how many stocks managed to outperform bonds over shorter time frames. The discovery of the intense market concentration seems to be a happy accident. The researchers found during shorter periods of time, about 56% of U.S. stocks and 61% of international stocks, underperform one-month U.S. Treasury bills. In any given month, only 43.7% of U.S. stocks, and 39.3% of non-U.S. stocks, outperformed the accumulated returns of one-month Treasury bills over the full sample period of 29 years. 2\n\nWe can shrug at that data point: after all, stocks are long-term investments and we really shouldn’t care very much about any given month’s returns. It’s the compounding, especially with dividends re-invested, that investors and savers should be thinking about. Still, this was yet another datapoint I found surprising.\n\nAnother data point is obvious: the longer buy-and-hold investors retained their equities, the greater the outperformance relative to Treasury bills. It is about 1% for any one month on average, about 14% for a year, 95% for a decade and a giant 260% for the 29-year sample period.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily all bad news for active investors; some of the data could be encouraging or even useful to stock pickers. One revelation might be that active managers should consider focusing less on being stock pickers, and more on being “stock-unpickers” — in other words, avoiding the dogs. Identifying the characteristics of those 37,195 long-term money-losers — what quantitative characteristics do they share that could be screened out — might be useful. This is a common practice for quants, but the sheer number of money-losing stocks makes one wonder if that approach is being fully exploited. If screens could eliminate some of the long-term losers, it might not only improve returns, but could help to justify fees higher than simple indexing.\n\nOthers might interpret the study as revealing yet another advantage of indexing: Not only are low costs and beta (market-matching performance) an indexing given, but the research suggests that investors who index broadly may be more likely to hold the rare and outsized winners that drive much of the market gains over time.\n\n___________\n\n1. Bessembinder is also the managing editor of the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, a position he’s held since 2003\n\n2. The authors’ note: “The finding that most stocks underperform US Treasury bills does not contradict the evidence (see, for example, Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton, 2002) that returns to broad stock markets handily outperform returns on Treasury instruments.”\n\n~~~\n\nI originally published this at Bloomberg, July 29, 2019.

But you may not be aware of the excellent points redemption opportunities available through All Nippon Airways (ANA).\n\nIn this post, I’ll show you how you can transfer your Amex points to ANA for some incredible flight deals.\n\nWith a tremendous list of partner airlines, ANA miles (transferred from your American Express points!) are useful for travel anywhere in the world. (Photo By NextNewMedia/Shutterstock)\n\nUsing American Express Points Through ANA\n\nANA is a Japanese-based airline, but thanks to an impressive list of partners, ANA miles can be used to travel just about anywhere in the world. As a member of the Star Alliance, ANA allows you to redeem miles for flights on any other Star Alliance airline.\n\nYou can use ANA miles to book flights on any Star Alliance airline.\n\nAnd if the Star Alliance isn’t enough, ANA has an additional 12 partner airlines where you can also use your ANA miles.\n\nANA has an additional 12 partner airlines outside of the Star Alliance!\n\nBy transferring your American Express points to ANA, you can book flights on any of the airlines pictured above. There are a few restrictions for partner redemption, though:\n\nMiles can only be redeemed for round-trip fares, not one-way flights\n\nStopovers are not allowed unless you begin your journey in Japan\n\nANA also has an option to book a round-the-world trip if you are looking to do some extended travel.\n\nANA Partner Sweet Spots\n\nWith ANA’s huge list of partners, you can travel nearly anywhere. But the following trips from the US stand out as a great use of your points:\n\n1. Travel to Europe\n\nRound-trips to Europe cost just 55,000 miles per ticket in economy and 88,000 miles in business class. This is a great deal, especially in business class, where you won’t often find a better redemption, at least on a regular basis. For a similar itinerary in business class, you would pay 140,000 miles per ticket on United and 115,000 miles on American Airlines.\n\nLooking to book a trip to Europe? A round-trip in business class costs only 88,000 ANA miles. (Photo By Andrey Yurlov/Shutterstock)\n\n2. Travel to Africa\n\nRound-trips to Africa cost just 65,000 miles per ticket in economy and 104,000 miles in coach. This appears to be the best fixed-award cost of any airline, though you may occasionally be able to find a cheaper price on Alitalia, where award prices vary depending on the time of year.\n\nAn award redemption on ANA is probably the cheapest way to fly to Africa on miles. (Photo By Picture.Perfect/Shutterstock)\n\n3. Travel to Japan\n\nANA also has the cheapest fixed-award flights to Japan. ANA breaks Japan into two regions. Economy flights are either 50,000 or 55,000 miles round-trip and business class flights are either 85,000 or 90,000 miles round-trip.\n\nWant to experience Japanese culture in Kyoto? ANA is a great way to get there. (Photo by Guitar photographer/Shutterstock)\n\nAvoiding Fuel Surcharges\n\nAn important factor in any award flight redemption is fuel surcharges. These extra fees, which some airlines charge on award flights, can add substantial costs to your travels. In some cases, fuel surcharges may be so high that it’s not worth it to use your miles for a flight. If you are using ANA miles, try to pick flights on these airlines, which do not add fuel surcharges:\n\nAir Canada\n\nAir China\n\nAir New Zealand\n\nAvianca\n\nCopa\n\nEtihad\n\nUnited (except to Asia)\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou can transfer your Amex Membership Rewards points to ANA and take advantage of some incredible deals on award tickets. And since ANA has a ton of partner airlines, you can redeem miles for travel almost anywhere in the world. There are many ways to redeem your ANA miles, but you can find excellent value on award trips between the US and Europe, Africa and Japan compared to other airlines.\n\nSome airlines add fuel surcharges to ANA redemption but others don’t. Be sure to check for any extra charges before completing your booking.\n\nAlso, remember to subscribe to our newsletter for more tips on how to be smart with your miles and points!\n",

          "description": "If you’re a voracious reader of new business titles, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Blinkist, the app that sells condensed versions of top-selling books.\n\nThe Berlin-based startup wants to solve what it calls the “modern reading problem,” which is that no one has much time for reading anymore. The app’s writers consume books on behalf of subscribers and reduce them to texts that take 15 minutes to zip through. The company hopes you’ll call these executive summaries “Blinks.”\n\nIf that sounds gross to you, you’re not alone. On the surface (Blinkist’s native territory) the service sounds like yet another sign of our culture’s demise. Facing short attention spans and a constant need for novelty, we’re throwing in the proverbial towel, giving up on any act that stretches our ability to focus on a narrative or go deep. (“After taking Blinkist for a spin, I think it may appeal less to a time-poor, avid reader than a sweating businessman, crouched in a golf course toilet, trying to quickly brush up on his knowledge of politics or astrophysics to impress his boss,” Sian Cain writes in her review of the app for The Guardian.)\n\nSome argue that Blinkist and its competitors, like Scribd’s new Snapshots, can have a place in one’s life if applied judiciously. They ought to be prohibited as stand-ins for literary work, goes the thinking, but may be acceptable shortcuts for mainlining non-fiction. Some books, meanwhile, really are meant to be information delivery systems, not experiences. In theory, that should make Blinkist perfect for books about careers and entrepreneurship, which are often fat with repetitive anecdotes, bullet-pointed material, and rehashed descriptions of social psychology or management studies.\n\nTo get a sense of what’s resonating with US readers, who make up the bulk of the app’s 10 million subscribers, we asked Blinkist to share the most frequently highlighted passages in its career and entrepreneurship categories over the past year.\n\nThe results do seem to capture certain preoccupations in our work lives: namely a desire for grounded-ness, presence, and balance. Readers were very taken, for instance, with Blinkist’s paraphrased definition of empathetic listening, from its summary of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Instructions for chilling out, distilled from Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You Succeed (Portfolio, 2017) also ranks high on the list.\n\nTellingly, one of the top 10 passages on careering has nothing to do with achievement at work. It comes from Blinkist’s summary of No Hard Feelings, a recently published book that calls for an end to emotional compartmentalization in the office. The favored line: “If your mood and life are coming to be dominated by work, then a good approach is to simply try to care a little less about your work, and a bit more about yourself.”\n\nBelow are the full results, the best of the Blinks, so to speak.

          "description": "Welcome to Camp52, where we're recapturing the fun of summer as a kid. All month long, you'll find playful, carefree ideas for snacks (s'mores and popsicles, anyone?), drinks, crafts, games, field trips, packing tips, and more.\n\nIn our oh-so busy digital world, I’ve found that one of the most relaxing things you can do on vacation is truly disconnect. And what better way to get off the grid than heading out into the woods for a summer camping excursion?\n\nPersonally, I love camping (even if I don’t do it as much as I’d like!). There’s something so calming about sleeping under the stars and relaxing in nature—without Wi-Fi or video games to distract you.\n \nHowever, if you’re planning your first-ever camping trip, you might not know what gear to buy and bring with you. Luckily, there are thousands of avid outdoorspeople who are more than happy to share their thoughts on popular equipment. To that end, here’s a list of some of the most highly rated camping gear that’s sure to make your trip a success.\n \nFirst up, you need high-quality sleeping equipment if you’re going to be rested and ready for adventure.\n\nReviews: 7,000+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nIt’s easy to see why this Coleman tent is so popular. It comes in a variety of sizes, sleeping anywhere from two to six people, and even the larger sizes are still incredibly affordable at under $100. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and its rainfly and welded floors will keep you dry, even if the weather outside is soggy.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 600+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nIf you need a more spacious sleeping space, this tent from CORE can accommodate up to nine people or two queen-size inflatable mattresses. It includes a room divider, as well as in-wall storage pockets, and the pre-assembled frame makes it incredibly fast and easy to construct. It’s the perfect option if you’re camping with the whole family!\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nDon’t feel like carrying an air mattress out into the wilderness? Just bring one of these inflatable sleeping pads instead. They weigh just 16 ounces, so they won’t drag you down, and they’re quick to inflate, unlike full-size mattresses. Plus, they have thousands of glowing reviews—what more could you ask for?\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,000+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nColeman is one of the go-to camping brands for frequent adventurers, so it should come as no surprise that they’ve pretty much perfected the sleeping bag. This affordable single-person sleeping bag is ideal for snoozing in 40- to 60-degree conditions, as the plush interior will keep you cozy all night long.\n\nPhoto by Coleman \n\nReviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars\n \nWant to cuddle up with your loved ones under the stars? This queen-size sleeping bag has more than enough room for two people, and it comes with two travel pillows, too. Reviewers say it's lightweight, cozy, and water-resistant, calling it a must-have for camping couples.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.1 stars\n \nRegular pillows are fairly bulky, and they’ll take up quite a bit of space in your car as you pack to go camping. Instead, get a couple of these compressible travel pillows, which roll up into a compact form, allowing you to save space in your bag. They come in a variety of sizes, as well as several adorable patterns.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Trying to Thrive in the Wilderness\n\nDon’t just get by on your camping trip—live your best life! You’ll need these essential tools to avoid bug bites, roast lots of marshmallows, and stay comfy in the woods.\n \nReviews: 1,200+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nBug spray is an absolute must when you’re camping, as there are sure to be mosquitoes and other biting critters around. Folks swear by this particular bug spray from Repel, which contains 40 percent DEET—the highest concentration available in a spray container. It provides up to eight hours of protection against mosquitoes, ticks, gnats, biting flies, and more, and reviewers say it’s not sticky or too smelly.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,500+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nChances are you’re not wearing bug spray to bed, so unless you want to wake up covered in itchy bug bites, be sure to pack some permethrin spray for your gear. When applied to fabrics (such as your clothing, tent, and sleeping bag), this chemical will keep bugs like ticks and mosquitos away. The best part? It lasts for up to six washes or 40 days, so you won’t have to reapply constantly.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.7 stars\n \nOnce the sun sets on your camp, you’ll need a few lanterns to illuminate your surroundings, and there’s no better option than this one from Streamlight. These lanterns come in a variety of strengths, ranging from 200 to 1,100 lumens, and they have rings on both the top and bottom for hanging them up. Plus, if you want to light up a larger area, just pop off the top of the lantern and let it shine.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,000+Rating: 4.0 stars\n \nIs your pack feeling a little heavy already? Don’t worry—this handy fire starter won’t weigh you down. The pocket-sized magnesium fuel bar comes with a striker, as well as a compass, all of which you can store on the convenient ball chain. Plus, it will work in wet conditions, ensuring you’re never left out in the cold.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Whipping Up a Woodsy Meal\n\nJust because you’re roughing it doesn’t mean you can’t cook delicious meals. With a stove, some cookware, and a can-do attitude, you’ll be able to eat like royalty.\n \nReviews: 2,000Rating: 4.5 stars\n \nAll you need to cook your favorite dishes is this two-burner propane stove, which folds up into a super-convenient form for transport. It has pressure-control technology to help provide consistent heat, and it even has wind-blocking side panels so your flame doesn’t go out. It’s basically a gas stovetop to use in the great outdoors!\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 3,000+Rating: 4.6 stars\n \nYou probably don’t want to bring your nice pots and pans out into the woods, so invest in this affordable camping mess kit, which includes an anodized aluminum pot, pan, and lid, as well as a number of cooking utensils. The cookware is lightweight and packs up into an easy-to-store bag, allowing you to cook deluxe dinners just about anywhere.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 1,500Rating: 4.2 stars\n \nThere are no fridges in the woods, so you’ll need to bring along a cooler to keep your drinks and food fresh—as well as a lot of ice! This zipperless hardbody cooler comes in several sizes, so you can choose the one that fits your needs, and it even includes a removable shelf to help you keep your grub organized.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Kicking Back and Relaxing\n\nWith the sleeping, eating, and bug spraying on lock, don’t forget to pack a few accessories to help you relax and unwind during your trip. It's the best part of the camping experience!\n \nReviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars\n \nWhat’s more serene than hanging out in a hammock and reading a good book? You can make this a reality, no matter where you’re camping, thanks to this portable hammock. It’s made from heavy-duty parachute-grade nylon, and you can set it up anywhere with the included tree straps and carabiners. Reviewers call this product fantastic, especially for such an affordable price.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 5,500+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nKeep your relaxation essentials close by with this camping chair, which has a built-in cooler pocket on one side and a mesh storage compartment on the other. The chair also has a fully cushioned seat and supportive back, making it the perfect tool to hang out and take in the scenery.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,500Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nKayaking is incredibly fun—but kayaks themselves are bulky and hard to transport. That’s what makes these inflatable kayaks such an amazing innovation! This particular model is ideal for lakes and mild rivers, and reviewers say it’s incredibly fun to use and easy to transport. Win-win.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\n This post contains products that are independently selected by our editors and writers, and Food52 may earn an affiliate commission. \n\nNow, for camping snacks...\n\n What's your favorite camping gear out there?

          "description": "Whether you vault over the Arctic or soar for hours over the blues of the Pacific Ocean, transpacific flights can be a chore — yes, even for AvGeeks. Not only are some of these flights among the longest in aviation, crossing the international date line wreaks havoc with your sense of time.\n\nBut if you plan your flights right, the next time work or play takes you from the US to various points in Asia, Australia, New Zealand (and back again), it’s a great excuse for a stopover in Hawaii. Here’s how to make the international date line work for you, instead of against you.\n\n1. It Breaks Up a (Really, Really) Long Flight\n\nThe best part of adding a Hawaiian stopover to your return flight? You turn one loooooooong flight into two shorter and more manageable ones. As a bonus, those segments also usually mean more miles accrued overall — definitely a win-win.\n\nParticularly for East Coasters heading to Australia and New Zealand, the Hawaii stopover is a game changer. Getting to Sydney (SYD) from a New York City-area airport, for example, may involve a six-hour transcontinental flight followed by a 15-hour international flight.\n\nInstead of slogging through the reverse on your return, when you book a multi-segment trip via Qantas — which offers five flights per week from Sydney to Honolulu (HNL) and will earn you Oneworld points — the flights look something like this: SYD to HNL (overnight, nine and a half hours), followed by a Hawaii stopover followed by HNL to LAX (five and a half hours), followed by LAX to New York (another five and a half hours).\n\nSimilar multi-segment itineraries can be booked on Air New Zealand, which offers daily flights from Auckland (AKL) to Honolulu (and will earn you Star Alliance miles).\n\n2. Honolulu Is a Gateway Hub\n\nWhile we tend to think of Hawaii as a destination in and of itself, Honolulu’s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is a major gateway to the US from destinations further east and south, as well as for flights inbound from the US mainland, so it’s actually an ideal stopover destination.\n\nAccording to the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, between April and June 2019 alone, there were 780,336 scheduled seats, representing 2,916 flights inbound for Hawaii that crossed the international date line — which breaks down to more than 200 flights per week on a total of 16 carriers with flights from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Fiji.\n\nHawaiian Airlines alone has 42 fights a week inbound for Honolulu that jump the date line, including daily flights from Sydney and Osaka, Japan (KIX); 11 flights per week from Tokyo Haneda (HND); five flights per week from Seoul, South Korea (ICN); and three flights weekly from Brisbane, Australia (BNE), Auckland, New Zealand (AKL) and Hokkaido, Japan (CTS). The airline also offers three flights weekly from Tokyo Haneda to Kona, Hawaii (KOA).\n\nHawaii’s Halona Blowhole near Honolulu is a great place to check out on your layover.

Speaking of Hawaiian Airlines …\n\nThough Hawaiian Airlines doesn’t have an official stopover promotion in place, such as those offered by Turkish Airlines or Qatar Airways that include accommodations on the ground, Hawaiian Airlines flyers going to or from the airline’s nine international destinations can get a free stopover in Honolulu on each leg, whether outbound or return, if they use the multi-city option when booking on Hawaiian’s website.\n\nAnd that’s the key travel hack here: Booking a multi-city or multi-segment trip lets you design a flight itinerary that includes 24, 48, 72 hours or more on the ground in Hawaii on your return for a minimal difference in cost. Think of it as a two-for-one vacation.\n\nBefore you make the long haul to Sydney’s Bondi Beach, be sure to book your stop over in Hawaii for a multi-segment trip. (Photo by Simon Rae / Unsplash)\n\n4. You Can Fly ANA’s New A380\n\nOther major news for Hawaii (and all the more reason to connect through Honolulu en route to Tokyo): On May 24, ANA’s first Airbus A380 made its debut on thrice-weekly service between Tokyo’s Narita Airport (NRT) and Honolulu. When the carrier’s second A380 entered service on July 1, ANA began offering 10 roundtrip flights per week on the brand-new planes — an AvGeek’s dream indeed.\n\n“We already have strong demand for the Tokyo-Honolulu route — not only among couples [and] honeymooners, but also families, high-end customers, group tours and a wide variety of customers,” an ANA spokesperson said. “We believe that the A380 will be instrumental in expanding our resort strategy as we seek to increase our market share by doubling the number of seats connecting Honolulu and Tokyo.”\n\n5. It’s a Cure for Jet Lag … Kind Of\n\nAnd finally we come to jet lag — or the relative lack thereof. By time of day (morning, midday, afternoon, evening), Honolulu is likely significantly more in line with your Asia-Pacific point of departure than your home time zone, wherever that may be. The major difference here is that Hawaii lies on the opposite side of the international date line.\n\nFor example: 7:44am Friday in Sydney is 11:44am Thursday in Honolulu, while 7:10am Saturday in Tokyo is 12:10pm on Friday. New Zealand is a whole 22 hours ahead of Hawaii by time zones, so 8:49am Friday in Auckland is 10:49am in Honolulu — yes, the day before. Departing on an overnight flight from any of these destinations, you land in Honolulu in the morning hours — on the same day you left.\n\nIt’s basically “Groundhog Day,” set in paradise.",

          "description": "What are you doing for your long weekend? What are your expectations?\n\nI ask because we can improve our vacations via behavioral science. Not just our holiday travel, but our investing, consumer purchases, even our retirement planning. I’ll have more on that on Monday, but since the Fourth of July long holiday weekend begins tomorrow (or even today), let’s discuss what you can do to improve your vacations.\n\nPsychologists and increasingly, economists have developed strategies to improve the decision making process helping to increase happiness and satisfaction from the good and services you buy.\n\nVacations are merely one example. It’s not just consumer goods or services that are impacted by your own psychology. Behavioral issues have a giant impact on our investing success and failure. Indeed, over the past 20 years, the field of behavioral economics has progressed from a backwater of grad school economics departments into a widely accepted, transformative science. Its proponents – folks like Richard Thaler, Robert Shiller, and Danny Kahneman have won Nobel prizes by deciphering how we think about decision-making.\n\nYou can use what we know to put behavioral science to to make better decisions in your financial life. Unfortunately, few put this knowledge to good use. Let’s use one example of consumer spending as an example to see if we can change that:\n\nVacations: Americans work longer and harder than ever, and time off is an important part of one’s mental health. Four behavioral insights might help you get the most of out of them.\n\nAnticipation: Lots of studies 1 have found that much of the pleasure of consumption is in the anticipation of the actual purchase. Use this to your advantage. Have fun thinking about your trip as you make plans. Talk about how much fun it will be to go to ____, see ____ and do ____. The mere act of thinking about and discussing travel brings pleasure, kickstarting the positive memories even before the trip begins.\n\nStart big, have a great peak. Two cognitive biases are in play here. The Primacy/Recency effect is the tendency to place greater impact on beginnings and ends. We recall first and last items on lists better than those in the middle; we judge presentations in part by how we feel about first and last impressions.\n\nThat works in tandem with the Peak-end rule. This “impacts how people remember past events. Intense positive or negative moments (the “peaks”) are heavily weighted in our mental calculus.” Use this to your advantage by making sure there are strong emotional peaks. It could be something as simple as a family gathering or as complex as scuba exploration of a wreck. As much as I love sitting on a Caribbean beach and reading books for a week, I always make sure there is at least one intense (hopefully positive) experience on vacation.\n\nFinish strong: Our final memories of an event– whether it’s a concert, a vacation or even an examination – is disproportionately impacted by how we recall the end of the experience. The final moments of any experience, good or bad, colors our overall impression. Take full advantage of the Primacy/Recency effect by finishing very strong.\n\nOn a trip to Grand Cayman not too long ago, on our last night on the island, we booked a chef’s tasting menu of food and drink at the Kimpton SeaFire’s Avecita restaurant at the chef’s counter (Bloomberg’s Kate Krader agrees with me). A spectacular meal, it was absolutely delightful (and way too much food). After a week of light fare, it was indulgent and memorable. That meal is the first thing I recall when I think about that vacation.\n\nSocialize the experience: Part of the reason experiences end up outperforming purchases is that they create last memories, typically with family and friends. 2  Unlike the way we adapt to physical goods we purchase, our recollections of specific events tend to improve with time and the rosy glow of nostalgia. Chalk it up to our faulty memories that tend to bring up our most recent recall of an event — our memory of the memory — rather than the event itself. That lends itself to making good experiences seem even better in retrospect, as we overemphasize the positives and forget about the negatives.\n\nVacations are part of a broader trend towards experiences over material goods.\n\nThose are a few simple behavioral hacks that will help you get more out of your vacations. There is a rich literature on the topic, feel free to go exploring.\n\n \n\n___________\n\n1.

          "description": "“Just buy this magic potion and all of your problems will disappear.”\n\nBig promises about quickly improving your credit can feel like magic potions — too good to be true, fairy tales that simply aren’t real.\n\nHowever, we have credit-improvement tips that aren’t just hype. They’re real and they can work wonders for some people in a very short period of time. For others,  significant credit score improvement takes more time, along with consistency and a lot of patience.\n\nNonetheless, the following tips are worth exploring. Depending upon the information that’s on your credit reports, these tips could help you boost your credit scores in as little as 30 days.\n\n1. Focus on Utilization\n\nIt almost goes without saying that you need to make your payments on time if you want to earn good credit scores. If your credit reports are already littered with late payments, it’s probably going to take some time for those delinquencies to stop hurting you.\n\nTo try to boost your credit scores quickly, you need to focus on credit-scoring components over which you have more control. Your credit utilization rate is one such area.\n\n“Credit utilization” refers to the percentage of your credit limits that’s being used on your credit card accounts. If you have a credit card with a $10,000 limit and a $5,000 balance, the account is 50% utilized (i.e., you’re using half of your available credit).\n\n$5,000 Balance ÷ $10,000 Limit = 0.5 X 100 = 50% Credit Utilization Rate\n\nLower utilization ratios are good for your credit scores. As you use more of your available credit and your utilization ratios climb, it has a negative impact on your credit score.\n\nHere’s why this matters.\n\nPayment history may be king when it comes to determining credit scores, but credit utilization is the queen. Credit utilization is largely responsible for 30% of your FICO Scores. As a result, lowering your credit utilization is one of the most productive ways to potentially improve your credit scores.\n\nYou can lower your credit utilization in two ways:\n\nPay down your credit card balances. This increases the amount of available credit on your account. Remember the example above where a $10,000 card with a $5,000 balance was 50% utilized? If the balance on that same card was paid down to $2,500, the new credit utilization rate would be only 25% once the account was updated on your credit report.\n\n$2,500 Balance ÷ $10,000 Limit = 0.25 X 100 = 25% Credit Utilization Rate\n\nAsk for a credit limit increase. If you can’t afford to pay off your credit card balances all the way to $0 right away, it might be worth asking your card issuer for a credit limit increase. A credit limit increase can help to lower your credit utilization ratio now while you’re working toward paying off your full balance. Let’s say you could afford to lower the $5,000 balance on the card above to $4,000 right now, but the card issuer gave you a credit limit increase to $16,000. Those two actions would still net you a credit utilization rate of 25% even though you paid less toward your overall balance.\n\n$4,000 Balance ÷ $16,000 Limit = 0.25 X 100 = 25% Credit Utilization Rate\n\nKeep in mind this is only a good idea if you have the discipline to not tap into your newly acquired credit. That new extra credit needs to remain open and unused for your utilization rate to drop. If you think expanding your credit limit might tempt you to spend more, don’t do it.\n\n2. Fix the Errors\n\nAs important as your credit reports are and as hard as the credit bureaus work to keep the information on your reports accurate, credit reporting mistakes do occur. In fact, a study by the Federal Trade Commission found that 20% of consumers had an error on at least one of their credit reports with Equifax, TransUnion or Experian.\n\nNot every error will wreck your credit scores, but many credit reporting errors can cause severe damage. This is especially true of derogatory information like late payments and collection accounts.\n\nSometimes even mistakes that might seem minor on the surface could have more of an impact on your credit score than you know. Since it can be difficult to tell whether a credit error is truly damaging your score, your best bet is to review all three of your credit reports often. If you find information that isn’t correct, the Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you the right to dispute those mistakes with the credit bureaus.\n\nThankfully, if an incorrect negative item is removed from your credit report, there’s a good chance your credit score will improve once the error is fixed or deleted outright.\n\n3. The Authorized User Secret\n\nDid you know that your credit score might be able to benefit from someone else’s good credit history? When a loved one adds you onto an existing credit card account as an authorized user, the account will typically find its way onto your credit reports within a few months.\n\nIf someone in your family has made on-time payments and has a low credit utilization ratio, they can also help boost your credit score. If the account was opened some time ago, there is an added bonus for you because your loved one’s account on your report might improve the average age of your credit — another move that might be very good for your scores.\n\nBefore you ask a spouse or loved one to add you onto his/her credit card as an authorized user, it’s important to ask the following questions:\n\nWhat is the type of credit card? (Some card issuers don’t report authorized user accounts to the credit bureaus.)\n\nHas the account ever been paid late?\n\nDo they pay the balance in full each month?\n\nEarning Good Credit for the Long Haul\n\nThe very best way to earn and keep great credit scores is to practice smart credit management habits over a long period of time. This means that you make your payments on time and don’t charge more on a credit card than you can afford to pay off in a given month.\n\nYou should also keep an eye on how often you apply for new credit, but realize that inquiries only play a minor role in credit scores.

          "description": "The marketing team for Salesforce Pardot has been doing a great job of playing off the Game of Thrones theme with a number of different content pieces. Fight for the Throne: Sales vs. Marketing is a fun, engaging infographic that plays to fans of the HBO series now that the series os over.\n\nLet’s face it: you don’t need to be watching HBO’s acclaimed series Game of Thrones to see a rivalry like the Starks and Lannisters. A similar struggle for power and recognition is happening in the modern office everyday — between sales and marketing.\n\nWith different goals, motivations, and tools, aligning your company’s sales and marketing departments can be a daily challenge. With each team staking their claim to different areas of the business process, it can be hard to find any common ground with which to bring them together. However, when sales and marketing work together to generate leads, nurture relationships, and close deals, a company can thrive. There’s a lot at stake in this struggle!\n\nTo help you identify the pain points, mindsets, and opportunities for peace between these two departments, we have put together the fun and informative infographic below.\n\nSometimes the messages you want to convey in an infographic aren’t based on numeric data, but concepts and business processes. This design does a good job of identifying different corporate departments as rival houses with competing interests.\n\nI also like that the ideas presented here have a long Online Lifespan. This infographic is actually an update to an earlier one they released in 2013: Sales vs. Marketing: The Original Game of Thrones. The rivalry between Sales and Marketing isn’t new in corporate culture, and won’t be going away anytime soon.\n\nFound on the American Marketing Association blog\n",

          "description": "Amazon launched a new promotion a few days ago that offers a 20% discount on up to $250 of spend when paying with at least 1 Membership Rewards point. See: Get 20% off at Amazon w/ 1 Membership Rewards point [YMMV]\n\nIt’s a great deal, but it’s also targeted. My wife and I were 0/2 with our accounts as we both received the following message saying that we’re not eligible.\n\nWe found ourselves in the exact same scenario last year when Amazon ran a similar promotion, albeit with a higher $500 spending limit. Back then, neither of us were targeted for the $100 savings, but we managed to get ourselves targeted by following a few different steps.\n\nCurious as to whether following the same steps would work again, I did just that a few days ago. I checked the next day to see if I was targeted – I wasn’t. I checked again the following day – still no joy. It was third time lucky though as I checked again yesterday and saw this shining beacon of wonderfulness.\n\nYep, I’d gotten myself targeted. To make sure the $5 million redemption limit didn’t get hit before I had a chance to take advantage of the deal, I immediately bought $250 worth of Airbnb gift cards.\n\nIf you’d received the same message saying that you’re not eligible, try following the same steps that I took. I can’t guarantee that you’ll definitely be targeted, but it worked on both mine and my wife’s accounts once again.\n\nStep 1\n\nFirst of all, delete all of your Membership Rewards-earning accounts from your Payment Options on Amazon. To do that, click on each applicable card, then click ‘Remove’.\n\nStep 2\n\nAdd at least one Membership Rewards-earning card back on as a payment option.\n\nStep 3\n\nNow that your Amex card is added back on, you’ll need to re-enroll in Shop With Points (our affiliate link). Click on the ‘Get Started’ button on that page and select your card. On the subsequent screen, make sure you select ‘Off’ where it asks if you want to apply Membership Rewards by default. Otherwise, you might accidentally pay for an entire order with Membership Rewards which is terrible value.\n\nStep 4\n\nCheck again to see if you were targeted for the 20% off promotion (our affiliate link).\n\nStep 5\n\nIf you weren’t targeted immediately, don’t give up – try that link every day. Like I mentioned earlier, it took three days before I became eligible for the offer, so hopefully you’ll have the same success in a few days time.\n\nEarn Miles Without Flying: START HERE\t\n\nThe post Not Targeted For The Amazon/Amex Deal?

          "description": "Being subjected to rubbery, overcooked scrambled eggs is enough to ruin the genre, but properly cooked scrambles are creamy, indulgent piles of comfort. I have long been a fan of the super-slow scramble, but I only enjoy them about once a month, as they take a full 45 minutes to cook. \n\nScrambled eggs are easy to make, but they’re kind of difficult to make perfectly. Rubbery, dry…\n\nRead more Read\n\nI can barely get it together enough to shower before noon, so standing over a stove for the better part of an hour is simply not an option during the workweek. But I do long for custardy, creamy eggs more mornings than I care to admit, which is why I will name my first child after Mandy of Lady & Pup’s, the woman who let the world know (via Food52) about the sheer and utter genius of adding cornstarch to scrambled eggs. (Just kidding, I’m never reproducing.)\n\nCornstarch—a common thickening agent—works wonders here, letting you cook eggs that seem slow-cooked in a fraction of the time. The curds are larger than the truly slow bois, but texture is just as rich, and still has that whole “cheesy without cheese” vibe going for it which, in my esteemed, highly-valued opinion, is the whole point of the slow scramble. These eggs are so creamy and so good that, after taking my first bite, all I could manage was a very quiet, very sincere, “well, fuck me.”\n\nJust like any other recipe that uses cornstarch as a thickening agent, this one has you make a slurry. Mandy recommends milk, but I used heavy cream, because it’s what I had. Stir the slurry until there are no lumps, creating an almost non-Newtonian fluid, then whisk it in with some beaten, salted eggs. The mixture noticeably thickens and, after a quick spell in a very hot pan, you have a pile of tender, velvety, creamy scrambled eggs. To make them yourself, you will need:\n\nEggs, at least 3\n\nCornstarch, 1/2 + 1/8 teaspoon for each egg\n\nMilk (or cream), 1 tablespoon for each egg\n\nSalt to taste\n\nButter, 1 tablespoon for each egg\n\nBeat the eggs and, in a separate bowl, beat the starch and dairy. Combine, season with salt, and beat into a uniform mixture. Heat a pan over high heat, then add the butter and, once it’s melted and foaming, add the eggs. Leave them alone until the edges start to set, then turn off the heat, move them to a cool burner if you’re using an electric stove, and push them around in circular, sweeping motions until they are just set, but still look not quite done. I had to move the pan back to the off-but-still-hot burner a couple of times, as the residual heat of the pan was not enough to finish the job. If you’ve been stirring your eggs for over half a minute, and they’re not quite done, pop ‘em back on low heat for a moment. Once they start to look “almost done,” spoon ‘em on a plate, and enjoy with lots of crisp, buttered toast.\n",

          "description": "For millennia, the ocean has been an inspiration for generations of storytellers and poets, novelists and artists. Throughout history, it has served as a ubiquitous backdrop for stories of adventure and exploration: Treasure Island, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea to name a few.\n\nIn recent decades, however, public interest in the deep sea seems to have been replaced by deep space. The internet went wild when the first published photos of a black hole were published in April. Every SpaceX mission makes global headlines, including the recent launch of the Starlink constellation of satellites in May. And now even your elderly grandmother probably knows about gravitational waves.\n\nBut for the sake of the planet, we need to stop exclusively looking to the stars for inspiration and dive a bit deeper instead.\n\nA literary sea change\n\nThe golden age of nautical storytelling was born from the real-world golden age of nautical exploration. Some milestones in this era include the historic voyage of Christopher Columbus across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, Ferdinand Magellan’s circumnavigation of the world in 1519, the invention of the submarine in 1620, James Cook’s scientific expedition to the Pacific Ocean in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s exploration of the Galapagos Islands on the HMS Beagle in 1831.\n\nArt imitated life, and during this time nautical fiction was a predominant literary genre. Two works that best represent this era are John Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) and Samuel Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798). This trend continued into the 19th century, which produced Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island (1883), and Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899).\n\nBut then something happened in the mid-20th century: The great unknown of space overtook the vastness of our ocean, both as a place of wonder and as a territory to be conquered. Ships and submarines were replaced by spaceships and rockets, and ocean-faring pop-culture references evaporated.\n\nThe meteoric rise of space stories\n\nHumanity has always been enamored with the night sky. Gazing at the stars—dreaming of what’s out there—is an almost innate aspect of the human condition, agnostic of language, geographic location, socioeconomic class, or culture.\n\nHowever, space was rarely a setting for storytelling until the mid-20th century. With a few exceptions of prescient writers such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, the zeitgeist didn’t contain space stories until we became a spacefaring species. Once the public realized we could go to space, we started telling stories about it. Art began imitating life once again.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, we read Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles (1950), Isaac Asimov’s Foundation (1951), Kurt Vonnegut Jr.’s The Sirens of Titan (1959), Robert Heinlein’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966), and Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). On TV, we watched the premiere of The Jetsons (1962), Lost in Space (1965), and Star Trek (1966). On the big screen, we saw The War of the Worlds (1953), Planet of the Apes (1968), Star Wars (1977), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), and Alien (1979).\n\nAt around the same time as real-world space exploration and the emergence of space in popular culture skyrocketed, public interest in the ocean receded with the tides.\n\nWhy have we moved on? Why does space now capture the imagination and the ocean does not?\n\nThe true final frontier\n\nWhat if the Golden Age of ocean exploration is in front of us, not behind us?\n\nAn estimated 95% of the ocean hasn’t been seen by human eyes. We have better maps of the surface of the Moon—and of Mars—than we do of our ocean floor.\n\nThe ocean is just as much of an alien environment than the aliens we search for in the cosmos. It houses an abundance of life—literally hundreds of thousands of species as yet discovered by humans—geological features unparalleled throughout our entire known solar system, and a veritable collection of scientific discoveries and pharmacological cures just waiting to be found. While space contains the veiled threat of a once-in-a-millennium meteorite, the health of the sea directly enables and facilitates all life on Earth right now; more than half the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, and the ocean absorbs an estimated 25% of all atmospheric CO2 we emit each year.\n\nThe artifacts of thousands of years of human civilization litter the ocean floor, making it by far the world’s largest museum, albeit a completely inaccessible one. While 571 people have traveled to space, only four have descended to the deepest-known point of our ocean, the Mariana Trench, which is more than a mile deeper than Mount Everest is tall.\n\nThere is a delta in modern times between the level of public interest in space compared to the level of public interest in the ocean. As a result, an unimaginable amount of money and resources have been devoted to furthering our knowledge of space, while only a fraction of that has been invested in understanding the ocean.\n\nWe need to re-mysticize the ocean—to remind people just how little we know about it. We need to re-spark public curiosity, especially at a time when the ocean’s health is in danger. If public interest in the ocean increases, so will the investment in research and exploration, which can result in increased awareness and protection.\n\n* * *\n\nIn a little-known speech by US president John F. Kennedy in 1963, less than four months before his assassination, he extoled the value of the ocean, calling its protection “of the utmost importance to man everywhere.” He committed the US to a long-term “vigorous program” to research and protect the ocean—a program that, due to his untimely death, went nowhere.\n\nIn an alternate universe (or perhaps in a Stephen King novel), this deep-sea program would have been the one that persevered instead of deep space, positively impacting and inspiring generations to come about the importance and power of our oceans.\n\nBut in this universe, in which we went to space instead, we need to re-stimulate a public discourse about the ocean. Funding for scientific research is critical and international agreements and cooperation are paramount. But we must also tell stories—stories that remind us about the mystery and majesty of our ocean, and the critical need for discovery and stewardship.\n",

That’s one of the reasons older media companies are trying to compete by consolidating. Disney, for example, recently completed its purchase of 21st Century Fox. Distributors like AT&T, which bought Time Warner last year, are becoming media companies, too.\n\nMeanwhile, giant tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple that used to be on the sidelines are getting closer and closer to the action. Apple’s newest TV strategy positions the company as a TV guide, a TV storefront selling services like HBO, and a TV creator that employs the likes of Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Anniston to make exclusive shows for Apple users.\n\nTo help sort this all out, we’ve created a diagram that organizes distributors, content companies and internet video companies by market cap — the value investors assign to the companies — and their main lines of business. \n\nHere’s what the Big Media universe currently looks like.

          "description": "With all the gorgeous, plant-filled interior spaces I’ve seen lately, it seems like any room could benefit from a little greenery. Even science says so: NASA's famous Clean Air study shows that certain indoor plants can provide a natural way of removing toxins like formaldehyde and ammonia from the air. Other research shows that just having plants around improves focus, lowers anxiety, and increases productivity. Yet another study concluded that people experience an unconscious calming reaction simply by touching a plant.\n \nBut if the idea of keeping a plant alive gives you the cold sweats, don’t despair: You can still embrace the lush life by selecting ones that fit your space and lifestyle. Read on for experts’ top picks for beginners who want to fill their home with plants—no green thumb required!\n\n1. Sansevieria (aka Snake Plant and Mother In Law's Tongue)\n\n“If you're looking for a plant that can endure a lot of neglect—not that I advocate such treatment—this is the one for you,” says Danae Horst, owner of Folia Collective in Eagle Rock, CA. “Sansevierias can tolerate very low light, as long as there's some natural light in the room, and have leaves that store water so they can go for longer stretches between watering.”\n \nWith over 60 different species of sansevieria, shapes can range from the classic “snake plant” look, to more interesting options like starfish (S. cylindrica “boncel”), or whale fins (S. masoniana)—perfect picks for statement-making decor.\n \nDo you have a spot that allows for hanging or trailing plants? Then perhaps a hoya fits the bill.\n\nThese waxy-leaved plants need lots of bright, filtered light (which means no direct sun). Horst recommends allowing the soil to dry out almost completely between waterings for the best result. If they have a trellis or stake, these vines will climb, or you can let them trail over the sides of its pot. “Over time they put out the most amazing looking little flowers!” says Horst.\n\n3. Ficus elastica (aka Rubber Plant)\n\n“If you’re looking for a large plant to fill a not-so-bright corner, ficus elastica would be the one,” says Deanna Florendo, San Francisco-based plant stylist and curator of Habitpattern.\n \nIt will thrive in lower-light conditions and is very forgiving when it comes to a missed watering. Its large, glossy leaves might need an occasional wipe-down to get rid of dust and water spots, but generally, you don’t need to do much. Florendo suggests repotting your ficus elastica once every couple of years.\n \nAnother of Florendo’s favorites is known as the dracaena marginata, sometimes called the dragon tree.\n \n“It’s an attractive, drought-tolerant plant that is great for beginners,” she says. “It prefers medium light, but will also do well in low light to partial shade.” She also notes that this plant can grow fairly tall, often over six feet even indoors, which can be a stunning addition for spaces with high ceilings.\n\n5. Monstera Deliciosa (aka Swiss Cheese Plant)\n\nThe ubiquitous monstera deliciosa has gained favor with plant lovers because of the distinctive splits and cutouts on its dark, glossy leaves. It requires bright to medium indirect light and medium water, but can tolerate a little drought.\n \n“If you forget to water your Monstera, it won’t hold a grudge,” says Rhiannon Cramm of Mickey Hargitay Plants. A happy Monstera can result in a voluminous plant that might require pruning, but this plant is also easy to propagate from cuttings—meaning you may find yourself with monstera babies to give away.\n\n6. Zamioculcas zamiifolia (aka ZZ Plant) \n\nAll of the experts I spoke with agreed that the ZZ plant is an excellent pick for forgetful caregivers, withstanding periods of drought and lower light conditions. Horst describes this plant as a sculptural beauty, and notes, “Over time the leaves can arch in a graceful fashion, and, if kept in good light and cared for well, the plant can grow to be quite large.”\n\n7. Pothos and Philodendrons\n\nOur last pick was a tie between pothos, picked by Cramm and Florendo, and philodendron, picked by Horst. These similar-looking plants are often confused for one another, thanks to the fact that they're both vines that can be trellised or left to trail. Both do best with bright, filtered light, and watering about once a week, and both offer a variety of leaf shapes and patterns that can add style to any space.\n\n What's your favorite indoor plant?

Do park rangers have this as a typeface on their computers to set in their word docs, pdfs and power point slides?\n\nI had a sketchbook with me and took some rubbings of the letterforms and asked my friend Miles Barger, the Visual Information Specialist for Rocky, if he had the typeface.

          "description": "Last week the Federal Reserve Board of Governors released its report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, the source of one of the most misleading statistics in America (and there are many contenders). Politicians and many journalists cite it when they say 40% of Americans can’t afford a $400 expense. If you believe it, it sounds like many households are a single event—such as a car break down or a hot-water heater repair—away from dire poverty. But the report says something slightly, but significantly, different. Based on a survey of 11,316 American households, the report says:\n\nIf faced with an unexpected expense of $400, 61 percent of adults say they would cover it with cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement—a modest improvement from the prior year. Similar to the prior year, 27 percent would borrow or sell something to pay for the expense, and 12 percent would not be able to cover the expense at all.\n\nWithin that 39%, about half would cover the expense with either a credit card or a bank loan. Another 10% of the original 11,316 could borrow the money from a friend or relative, and 2% would take a payday loan. Just 12% would not be able to cover the expense at all. It is also worth noting how much these numbers improved over time. In 2013, 50% of Americans didn’t have $400 in cash, now 61% do.\n\nIt is not good that 21% of Americans would have to incur a high interest loan, from credit cards or payday loans, if they faced an emergency. But it’s also a long way from 40% of the population on the verge of financial ruin. According to the survey, 27% of Americans usually have a positive credit card balance and 26% do from time to time. The survey suggests curbing credit, with well-intentioned proposals to restrict credit cards or payday loans that could have some unintended consequences. For one, it would reduce access to emergency credit for many households.\n\nIt is also important to note it’s not only low earners in this position. According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, 46% of American households who earn more than $80,000 carry a credit card balance. A powerful 2016 essay in the Atlantic by Neal Gabler describes how even the upper middle class often lives paycheck-to-paycheck and have become the high-earning poor. He describes desiring a lifestyle that exceeds his earnings, while for others it is a choice about how they want to allocate their money. Why save for a small, financial emergency when you can put it on a credit card (at least in the short-term before those interest payments add up)?\n\nTo be sure, with high interest rates, this is not advisable strategy. Which means that when we hear that 40% statistic we should demand better financial literacy and hope for a return to frugal values that idealizes a healthy bank account instead of owning more things. But it also does not mean nearly half of American can’t afford a car repair.\n",

          "description": "There’s no way that hot cartoons are actually the future of fashion advertising. Unless there’s already too much money involved to stop them.\n \nEvery story about a virtual influencer starts the same way: She is beautiful. She has a ton of followers. She is mysterious, yet her personality is fantastic. She loves Calvin Klein. Also — she’s not real! She was made by a computer to look as much like a hot and charming human being as possible without scaring people. Her body casts a shadow. She has flyaways and freckles. \n\nThe most famous example of the virtual influencer is Lil Miquela, who debuted on Instagram in April 2016, as if from nowhere. Of course, no arguably useless technological innovation actually comes from nowhere, and she was no exception. After months of speculation in Instagram comments and on news sites — with theories ranging from “Sims marketing stunt” to “horrifying social experiment” — the secret was revealed and was shockingly mundane: Yeah, it’s advertising. \n\nIn January, TechCrunch reported that Lil Miquela’s creators had closed a $125 million investment round led by Spark Capital. Suddenly, virtual influencers were the future of ads. The future of fashion. The future of commerce. \n\nAre these lithe, high-resolution bodies really coming for the jobs held by models and scene kids for the last several decades?\n\nBut are these lithe, high-resolution bodies really coming for the jobs held by models and scene kids for the last several decades? There is little evidence so far that this is the case, beyond a handful of successful Instagram accounts and a lot of conversation. The way funding is heaped onto every startup that gets 15 minutes of attention from the press typically makes the success of bizarro-world innovations feel inevitable and unavoidable — the most barbed response we can summon the energy for is to drag out that same tired Jurassic Park meme about the hubris of making shit for no reason. (And if this isn’t going to happen, why are people lining up to throw millions of dollars at it? We forget they are gambling.) \n\nThe virtual influencer could be a novelty technology, destined to flash in the pan like “hoverboards” or movie theaters equipped to spray people with “rain” in the middle of Batman movies. Like the blockchain! Or you know, it could take all of the hot people’s jobs. \n\nThere aren’t really that many virtual influencers — yet. \n\nFirst, the cast of characters. Lil Miquela, the effortlessly hip forever-19-year-old with 1.5 million followers, also has two friends: Blawko, a boy and self-described “young robot sex symbol” whose mouth is constantly covered with designer pollution masks and who has a paltry 135,000 followers; and Bermuda, his ex-girlfriend and Lil Miquela’s blonde, Trump-voting foil, whose bio boasts that she is a “Robot/Unbothered mogul with daddy’s PIN and a flawless highlight.” All three were created by the team at the mysterious Los Angeles startup Brud for vague reasons. \n\nLil Miquela, the effortlessly hip forever-19-year-old, has 1.5 million followers.\n\nJenna Sauers, writing for Cultured in April, paid special attention to the strange myth-building Brud has done around its creations and its founders, some of which has included outright lies. Brud calls itself “a technology startup specializing in artificial intelligence and robotics,” she points out, and news outlets from Architectural Digest to CNN are simply parroting this verbatim. But “Brud holds no patents in AI, robotics, or related fields,” and Lil Miquela is little more than a well-crafted image. The piece walks through other exaggerations: co-founder Sara DeCou’s one-time claim to be President Obama’s “special adviser on the ethics of AI development, and the other co-founder Terver McFedries’s claim to have written a bill of rights for AIs.”\n\nThe team has argued here and there that Lil Miquela’s support of Black Lives Matter, reproductive rights, and LGBTQ+ causes can inspire real change. Last year, The Cut’s Emilia Petrarca wrote about Brud’s statement that it hoped to be the modern Will & Grace, saying “As with all things Brud, it’s hard to tell if they’re trolling us with this reference or if they’ve been sipping too much of the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid.”\n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n If I don't have tacos at least once a week, I glitch.

Anyone a casual tortilla con mantequilla kinda kid?\n \nA post shared by  *~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) on Mar 6, 2019 at 5:06pm PST\n\nLess vague, Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing’s #BalmainArmy of virtual models. The first, Shudu, was designed by British photographer Cameron-James Wilson in early 2018. She racked up followers after the managers of the Instagram for Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty line apparently mistook her for a real customer and briefly reposted a photo of her “trying out” the brand’s matte lipstick. Shudu’s bio declares her “the world’s first digital supermodel,” and she is much taller and more classically beautiful than Lil Miquela. In 2018, Rousteing hired Wilson to make two more digital supermodels, exclusively for Balmain. He came up with Xhi — a gorgeous Chinese woman modeled after David Bowie — and Margot — a gorgeous French woman modeled after Rousteing’s childhood fantasies about French women. Neither Xhi nor Margot have their own Instagram accounts, and they exist solely for Balmain ads.\n\nMy personal favorite is Lu, the very strange virtual influencer who appears in ads for Brazil’s Bed Bath & Beyond-equivalent Magazine Luiza. She listens to Lana Del Rey while she jogs. When I first learned this about her, I was moved enough to write about it for Racked, asking “While she is deliberately dragging down her own morning jog vibe with music about the disposability of the female body, the danger of icons, and the inherent violence of American popular culture, is Lu also subtly ribbing Lil Miquela, all of her ilk, and me?” \n\nConversations about diversity and representation in the fashion industry were already at a fever pitch. An influx of avatars makes it even more complicated.\n\nThis brings us to the controversy of virtual influencers. They are physically perfect women made of pixels, standing in for women who have long been pressured to become physically perfect, without the advantage of that even being possible. Lil Miquela herself acknowledged this, sort of, when she asked YouTube conspiracy theorist Shane Dawson, in response to a question about the manipulation of her image, “Can you name one person on Instagram who doesn’t edit their photos?” The women of the fashion industry and particularly of Instagram are already pushed to Photoshop themselves, or to real-life-Photoshop themselves, which is to say “get cosmetic surgery.” \n\nIsn’t it interesting the way we can talk out both sides of our mouths, simultaneously espousing a new age of body positivity and self-acceptance, while also making it clear that supermodels are incapable of reaching beauty standards set by things that are not even alive? \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n Shudu @thesavoylondon trying on beautiful #EEBAFTAs outfits, complete with @atelierswarovski earrings. 6 days to go till she shares #redcarpet looks with you all. . @ee @BAFTA . . #3D #3Dart #digitalsupermodel #worldsfirstdigitalsupermodel #virtualinfluencer #BTS\n \nA post shared by  Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Feb 4, 2019 at 11:07am PST\n\nTo add insult to injury, this collection of virtual influencers is far more diverse than the roster of brand ambassadors and runway models that major fashion brands have employed for most of their existence. This May, Calvin Klein rolled out its #MYTRUTH campaign, which featured actual famous people like Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish, and the brand’s favorite permalancer A$AP Rocky. It also involved a video in which supermodel Bella Hadid made out with Lil Miquela. In her Calvins! This was a disaster, with critics immediately pointing out the double whammy: In the first place, it was queer-baiting, presenting two women kissing as exotic and bizarre. But also, could they not even cast an actual gay person? There are limits to the usefulness of “representation,” seen here when a job that could have gone to an underrepresented group went instead to a collection of pixels with no personal political context at all. \n\nThere are limits to the usefulness of “representation” — e.g. when you replace real people with avatars.\n\nIn an email newsletter, the writer Rob Horning compared this to Time’s infamous 1993 cover for its “New Face of America” immigration issue, which showed a surreally smooth, smiling face — a computer-generated projection of what future “deracialized” generations of America might look like. Lil Miquela, he argues, is “a figure from an idealized future where human difference is resolved not through political struggle but through process of automated averaging and morphing. ... a visual expression of an algorithmic sublime.” \n\nSimilar criticism was levied at Shudu, a black woman avatar designed by a white man. Writing for the New Yorker, Lauren Michele Jackson says the character reminds her of black minstrelsy and dryly quotes the creator saying that his biggest influence was “a special-edition Princess of South Africa Barbie doll.” \n\nAlso ... these things are just plain scary? \n\nThe term “uncanny valley” was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. It refers to the feeling of discomfort we experience when something is close enough to human-looking or seeming to trick our brains into approaching it that way — but we can’t be fooled fully. We always find what’s wrong. \n\nLil Miquela speaks as if she is a person with feelings. In a cover story for High Snobiety last April, she’s quoted at length. Discussing her critics, she tells a reporter via email, “I think people feel a little vulnerable in general right now. They have a lot of frustration and need something to target it at, usually it’s something that they don’t understand. So, I try not to let it get to me too much, because it’s a symptom of people trying to digest all of the change happening every day.” \n\nThis is not so different really than other types of first-person speech on the part of brands — Sunny-D threatening to kill itself, HBO texting its boss (?) — because despite what her copywriters would tell you, Lil Miquela is not actually a robot. None of this is artificial intelligence. It’s just computer motion graphics and captions written with, one can only guess, a meticulous company style guide. \n\nWow - ⁦@lilmiquela⁩ billboard in Times Square pic.twitter.com/QPaIRu8ApV\n— adam bain (@adambain) August 18, 2018\n\nAs Business of Fashion’s Christopher Morency pointed out in February 2018, virtual celebrities aren’t exactly new either. We are more than two decades out from the founding of virtual band Gorillaz, and 13 years past their first Grammy win. The Japanese virtual pop star Hatsune Miku has been on multiple arena tours and was dressed in 2013 by Marc Jacobs. Louis Vuitton hired a Final Fantasy character for a 2016 ad campaign. Lil Miquela is more technically complicated than these characters, but not by much. \n\nThe Verge’s Julia Alexander explained in January that, while Lil Miquela herself does not involve any AI or robotics, she might motivate the creation of a virtual influencer who could: \n\nHer success has inspired venture capitalists like Betaworks to invest heavily in virtual creators and work with startups to progress the technology forward. The future of influencers, according to the general director of Betaworks’ startup boot camp, Danika Laszuk, is digital beings who actually are powered by AI. Betaworks’ next startup camp will focus on what Laszuk calls “synthetic media” — a combination of computer-generated imagery and AI capabilities. The company plans to make a series of $200,000 investments in 10 startups that want to build technology that can create better digital influencers. \n\nAlexander goes on to paint a picture of a future in which virtual influencers need no human assistance at all once they’re published, and quotes Edward Saatchi, the co-founder of “virtual beings” company Fable Studio, who promises to make influencers who can move between platforms. They’d be, basically, sentient avatars dancing between YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and so on, using machine learning to talk and evolve. \n\nWhether digital influencers catch on or not, the fashion industry is about to spend a ton of money on them\n\nThe biggest selling point of virtual influencers if you work in advertising or fashion isn’t the perfection of an avatar’s body or face but the predictability of its behavior. \n\n“You remove some of the PR risks from influencers who may do something that could impact [your] base of customers,” Andrew Dunst, a vice president at the marketing and software conglomerate Sage Group told WWD last July. “Everything this virtual influencer does is in a controlled setting by the people who are managing that account.” It’s a funny argument. The biggest public relations risks for brands have never been the paycheck-dependent influencers or rigorously trained celebrities who stand at the front of their ad campaigns — it’s always been the tone deafness or general idiocy of the people behind the campaigns, the immoral or poorly executed business decisions made the people in charge, or the simple undesirability of whatever they’re selling. \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n Fell asleep reading lol Anyone else get sleepy when it’s warm out?

Named Liam Nikuro, he’s an “all-CG head made with the use of 3-D tools on a body filmed in live action,” and he will find work in music, fashion, and entertainment as a “multimedia producer,” according to his creators. This will involve “innovative creative content in combination with AI technology,” although what exactly that might mean goes unexplained. Liam loves 2Pac and Justin Bieber, he says; Juniper Research estimates that the global fashion industry will invest $3.6 billion in artificial intelligence technology this year.\n\n“The boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion,” Donna Haraway wrote in her famous 1985 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto.” She was talking about possible futures for feminism and ways to use technology to make bodies more livable — as well as society more ethically coherent while more emotionally and intellectually ambivalent — and she was not at all talking about the question of Lil Miquela. This was decades before commercial social media!\n\nStill, it’s striking how well her somewhat trollish predictions have held up. We are spending so much time riddling out whether we can trust robots to represent us or sell us underpants, whether these images are robots at all, whether the people behind them can be trusted, whether any of it matters. At this point, if it’s what we’re talking about, it’s kind of what we’re doing. \n\nSign up for The Goods newsletter.

          "description": "In Why Are The Prices So D*mn High? Helland and I examine lower education, higher education and health care in-depth and we do a broader statistical analysis of 139 industries. Today, I will make a few points about education. First, costs in both lower and higher education are rising faster than inflation and have been doing so for a very long time. In 1950 the U.S. spent $2,311 per elementary and secondary public school student compared with $12,673 in 2013, over five times more (both figures in $2015). Note also from Figure 2 that the rate of increase was fastest in the 1950s and 1960s–a point to which I will return later in this series.\n\nCollege costs have also increased dramatically over time. For this book, we are interested in costs more than tuition because we want to know what society is giving up to produce education rather than who, in the first instance, is paying for it. Costs are considerably higher than tuition even today, although in recent years tuition has been catching up. Essentially students and their parents have been paying an increasing share of the increasing cost of higher education. Moreover, as with lower education, costs have been rising for a very long period of time.\n\nI will take it as given that the explanation for higher costs isn’t higher quality. The evidence on tests scores is discussed in the book:\n\nIt is sometimes argued that how we teach has not changed but that what we teach has improved in quality. It is questionable whether studies of Shakespeare have improved, but there have been advances in biology, computer science, and physics that are taught today but were not in the past. However, these kinds of improvements cannot explain increases in cost. It is no more expensive to teach new theories than old. In a few fields, one might argue that lab equipment has improved, which it certainly has, but we know from figure 1 that goods in general have decreased in price. It is much cheaper today, for example, to equip a classroom with a computer than it was in the past.\n\nThe most popular explanation why the cost of education has increased is bloat. Elizabeth Warren and Chris Christie, for example, have both blamed climbing walls and lazy rivers for higher tuition costs. Paul Campos argues that the real reason college costs are growing is “the constant expansion of university administration.” Redundant administrators are also commonly blamed for rising public school costs.\n\nThe bloat theory is superficially plausible. The lazy rivers do exist! But the bloat theory requires longer and lazier rivers every year, which is less plausible. It’s also peculiar that the cost of education is rising in both lower and higher education and in public and private colleges despite very different competitive structures. Indeed, it’s suspicious that in higher education bloat is often blamed on competition–the “amenities arms race“–while in lower education bloat is often blamed on lack of competition! An all-purpose theory doesn’t explain much.\n\nMore importantly, the data reject the bloat theory. Figure 8 shows spending shares in higher education. Contrary to the bloat theory, the administrative share of spending has not increased much in over thirty years. The research share, where you might expect to find higher lab costs, has fluctuated a little but also hasn’t risen much. The plant share which is where you might expect to find lazy rivers has even gone down a little, at least compared to the early 1980s.\n\nNor is it true that administrators are taking over the public schools, see Figure 10.\n\nCompared with teachers and other staff, the number of principals and administrators is vanishingly small, only 0.4 per 100 students over the 1950–2015 period. It is true, if one looks closely, that the number of principals and administrators doubled be-tween 1970 and 1980. It is unclear whether this is a real increase or a data artifact (we only have data for 1970 and 1980, not the years in between during this period). But because the base numbers are small, even a doubling cannot explain much. A bloated little toe cannot explain a 20-pound weight gain. Moreover, the increase in administrators was over by 1980, but expenditures kept growing.\n\nIf bloat doesn’t work, what is the explanation for higher costs in education? The explanation turns out to be simple: we are paying teachers (and faculty) more in real terms and we have hired more of them. It’s hard to get costs to fall when input prices and quantities are both rising and teachers are doing more or less the same job as in 1950.\n\nWe are not arguing, however, that teachers are overpaid!\n\nIndeed, it is part of our theory that teachers are earning a normal wage for their level of skill and education. The evidence that teachers earn substantially above-market wages is slim. Teachers’ unions in public schools, for example, cannot explain decade-by-decade increases in teacher compensation. In fact, most estimates find that teachers’ unions raise the wage level by only approximately 5 percent. In other words, teachers’ unions can explain why teachers earn 5 percent more than similar workers in the private sector, but unions cannot explain why teachers’ wages increase over time.\n\nIf the case for unions as a cause of rising teacher compensation in public schools is weak, it is nonexistent for increased compensation for college faculty, for whom wage bargaining is done worker by worker with essentially no collective bargaining whatsoever.\n\nA signal to where we are heading is this:\n\nIf increasing labor costs explain the increasing price of education but teachers are not overpaid relative to similar workers in other industries, then increasing labor costs must lead to higher prices in the education industry more than in other industries.\n\nRead the whole thing.

          "description": "Before there was Amazon, there was Target — that’s pronounced tar-ZHAY for those who like to fancy things up a bit. There’s still a place for Target, even in the age of Amazon Prime Now. The store with its distinctive red logo is the place we go when we’re out of toilet paper and toothpaste — and then walk out with a home’s worth of updated seasonal decor — potentially without the two items we actually need. It’s where we take our teething babies to get out of the house, our preschoolers who “earned” a trip to toy aisle or to just enjoy some Starbucks and in-real-life aisle browsing. Where some brick and mortar stores have shriveled up, Target is still very much a part of shopping culture in 2019.\n\nIn addition to offering instant shopping gratification, Target offers its VIP shoppers bonus savings: 5% off just about everything, free two-day shipping for online purchases of any amount when paying with the REDcard — plus a bonus 30-day window for returns. \n\nIf you love Target, you may already have the REDcard. If you don’t have it, now is a great time to consider signing up for one, because Target is offering a coupon for $35 off a $70+ purchase for new card holders who sign up by June 15, 2019.\n\nImage courtesy of Target\n\nTarget REDcard Facts\n\nFirst, know that there are two REDcards: a debit and a credit card. The debit card debits from your checking account and the credit card racks up a balance and sends you a monthly bill.\n\nBoth types of Target REDcard holders enjoy the following perks:\n\n5% off virtually anything in-store or online (A few exceptions apply, including prescriptions, eye exams and some gift cards) (But the 5% discount totally works on some third-party gift cards — such as for trips to Disney.)\n\n15% off and free shipping on subscriptions for select brands of formula, diapers and wipes\n\n5% savings at Target Starbucks locations\n\nFree two-day shipping on all purchases\n\nExclusive offers such as “buy two, get one free” books\n\nEarly access to fun, limited-edition items such as the Funko POP! Star Wars: Red Chrome Darth Vader\n\nAn extended return period (30 extra days) on all eligible items\n\nAs a general rule, many store credit cards are terrible on several fronts because they charge high APRs and offer poor benefits without any type of purchase protections. Furthermore, they often offer low credit limits.\n\nRelated: Best Credit Cards for Purchase Protections\n\nHowever, the Target REDcard debit card is a notable exception to some of these rules, because it offers savings and perks without triggering a credit pull or affecting any other aspect of your credit. The Target REDcard challenges our usual rule of thumb to avoid debit card spending because just about each dollar spent on this card earns you an effective minimum of 5% off, even before taking into account additional perks such as free shipping and limited-time offers or stackable coupons. Most debit cards don’t come close to those sort of rewards.\n\nWhy I Got the Target REDcard Debit Card\n\nThe $35 off $70 new card holder promotion prompted me to bite the bullet and apply for my own REDcard of the debit variety. (The coupon will be mailed to you when approved and valid until July 20, 2019.) I held off getting a REDcard until now because I never bothered to read the fine print, assuming that traditional rewards credit cards always offer the best bonus-earning potential. Now that I’m approved, I plan to use my REDcard primarily for online purchases under $35, which will allow me to take advantage of the free two-day shipping perk. It may be a silly reason, but sometimes Target offers $2 OPI nail polishes or similar sales on small items that wouldn’t be worth paying a $5+ shipping fee or a making a separate trip to the store.\n\nWhen I shop online, I also double-dip on my savings by checking CashBackMonitor.com and using whichever shopping portal is paying the best rewards at the time.\n\nHow to Get the Target REDcard\n\nFrom the Target.com homepage, navigate to the REDcard link at the top right corner. Once there, you’ll see application links for both the debit card as well as the credit card. Again, we generally suggest opting for the debit card version if you care about rewards cards, since there are credit cards that are much better for overall shopping and you probably don’t want to risk a Chase 5/24 slot.\n\nThe debit card application process was straightforward, but not super simple. I had to share my SSN, driver’s license and bank routing and checking account information. \n\nSince my REDcard is tied to a checking account, Target warned that I might initially find a spending limit imposed on my card, especially for the first few purchases. I was also warned that there would be daily-limit triggers based on the number of card uses per day, presumably for my financial protection.\n\nAfter I finished the application for the debit card, I had the option of verifying my account instantly by logging into my bank, or going the traditional route of waiting for Target to make a couple of tiny deposits with me verifying the amounts on the website.\n\nI thought this was a nice feature, since it would have allowed me to shop online immediately after sign up. Unfortunately, I was too eager to screen shot the page above, so I lost the ability to verify my account immediately. I will have to exercise patience.\n\nI’m really looking forward to seeing what sort of fun (and occasionally frivolous) purchases will now be more affordable with a few keystrokes or a trip to the local Target. Of course, I’m still responsible for keeping a keen eye on my spending — as I would be with any card, store-branded or otherwise. If you’re as tempted by the dollar aisle as I am, don’t forget to stack your earnings by signing up for Target Circle, a rewards program that is not tied to having the REDcard.\n\nFeatured photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/VIEWpress/Corbis via Getty Images.",

          "description": "When I ask readers about their favorite award currency, Chase Ultimate Rewards is often a #1 pick. That’s true due to an abundance of excellent transfer partners. Shortly after we made major changes to our Reasonable Redemption Values (See: A big change to Frequent Miler’s point values.), we published a post on easy ways to get good value out of Citi ThankYou points. Today, we look at easy ways to get good value out of Chase Ultimate Rewards points. Note that this post does not cover all of Chase’s transfer partners, but rather the ones where you’ll find easy value. See also our Complete Guide to Chase Ultimate Rewards for everything you need to know about earning and burning these valuable points.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Abu Dhabi, a Marriott property (which is a Chase transfer partner)\n\nHotels\n\nThe area in which Chase truly shines over others is hotel partners. Citi has none; Amex has three (Choice Privileges, which has limited valuable uses; Hilton, which frequently sells points for much less than the value of Amex points; and Marriott, which it shares with Chase). Chase has three parters, two of which present a number of sweet spots: Hyatt and Marriott. While Hyatt presents plenty of opportunity to get incredible value, Marriott shouldn’t be counted out as a potentially valuable partner. Chase also partners with IHG, but since you can often buy IHG points for about half a cent each, you’re probably better off buying what you need than transferring more valuable Ultimate Rewards points most of the time.\n\nHyatt\n\nThe short story: Hyatt generally has nice hotels in most major cities and awards are very reasonable compared to the cash cost of most properties. Hyatt also has great benefits for top-tier elites.\n\nMiles required: Hyatt’s award chart has properties for 5K, 8K, 12K, 15K, 20K, 25K, 30K, or 40K points per night. Cash & points nights require half the points and approximately half the nightly room rate.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for availability at Hyatt.com by checking the box that says “Use points”.\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Hyatt.com. To add elite upgrades like Globalist suite night upgrades or Explorist Club Access Awards, you will need to call or contact the Twitter team (which can also help book award rooms — see: New Hyatt properties: reminder of an old trick.)\n\nKey warnings: One great use of Hyatt points can be to first transfer Ultimate Rewards to your Hyatt account and then transfer those Hyatt points from your Hyatt account to the account of a Hyatt Globalist so that he or she can book a Guest of Honor stay for you. Just keep in mind that although you can transfer from Ultimate Rewards to Hyatt as many times as you wish, your Hyatt account can only be involved in one Hyatt-to-Hyatt transfer (in or out) every 30 days.\n\nMarriott\n\nThe short story: While transfers to Marriott aren’t always a good use of Ultimate Rewards points, you can certainly find many instances where they are nearly as good as Hyatt points.\n\nMiles required: Marriott’s award chart has properties for 7.5K, 12.5K, 17.5K, 25K, 35K, 50K, 60K, or 85K points per night at standard prices (each category will also have higher and lower prices when peak and off-peak pricing begins).\n\nHow to find awards: Search for availability at Marriott.com by checking the box that says “Use points”.\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Marriott.com.\n\nKey warnings: Keep in mind that Ultimate Rewards points can be used to buy paid travel at a value of 1.5c per point through the Ultimate Rewards portal with the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Many properties at 50K points per night or higher could likely be booked for fewer points via the Chase portal and/or present less value than similar-caliber Hyatt properties. The true sweet spots here are likely to be at the 7.5K, 12.5K, 25K, and 35K levels in my experience, but you’ll want to compare against the cost of just booking through the portal instead.\n\nDomestic US flights\n\nWhile Chase partners with three US-based carriers (United, Southwest, and JetBlue), you can often get even better value for domestic flights from its foreign transfer partner programs. One reason to consider a transfer to Southwest is flexibility since you can cancel Southwest award flights for no fee.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThe short story: Virgin Atlantic often offers Delta flights for many fewer miles than Delta would charge for the same itineraries.\n\nMiles required: 12,500 miles each way plus $5.60 for direct domestic US flights on Delta\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at VirginAtlantic.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at VirginAtlantic.com.  See: How to book Delta flights with Virgin Atlantic miles.\n\nKey warnings: Virgin Atlantic charges each segment separately (i.e. an itinerary with a single connection will cost 25K miles), so they are not a good choice for connecting itineraries.\n\nUnited\n\nThe short story: United offers domestic one-way awards for as few as 10K miles each way and offers expanded availability to credit card holders and elite members.\n\nMiles required: 10K to 12.5K miles each way plus $5.60 for the cheapest saver-level domestic economy class awards.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at United.com\n\nKey warnings: United has eliminated its award chart, so you may see many different prices for award tickets. The $75 close-in booking fee for flights departing within the next 21 days reduces the value of United miles for bookings near departure.\n\nBritish Airways Avios\n\nThe short story: British Airways offers a distance-based award chart that can be useful for short direct flights on American Airlines with no close-in booking fee and great flexibility due to an easy cancellation policy.\n\nMiles required: 7.5K miles each way plus $5.60 for economy-class segments covering up to 1,151 miles flown.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at britishairways.com.\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at britishaiways.com\n\nKey warnings: British Airways charges for each segment separately, so multi-segment trips can get expensive quickly. Furthermore, the British Airways site sometimes shows phantom award space for AA (see: Phantom menace: an award search time suck). You may want to double-check Qantas.com for availability before transferring to British Aiways Executive Club.\n\nIberia Avios\n\nThe short story: Iberia Plus offers a distance-based award chart that can be useful for short itineraries on American Airlines (even those with connections) with no close-in booking fee. See: From 11K RT on American: A sweet spot for North American flight redemptions.\n\nMiles required: From 11K miles round trip plus $11.20 for economy-class itineraries. The best deals are itineraries of 2,000 miles flown or fewer since they cost 17,000 miles round trip at most when American has availability.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at iberia.com.\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at iberia.com.\n\nKey warnings: Most Iberia partner bookings, including those on American Airlines, are completely nonrefundable and can not be changed. Only book AA flights with Iberia if plans are certain.\n\nSouthwest\n\nThe short story: Southwest points are typically only worth about 1.5c towards the cost of a flight, but award bookings are totally flexible since they can be changed or canceled with no fee up until shortly before departure.\n\nMiles required: Varies by route but can be as cheap as less than 2K miles each way.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Southwest.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Southwest.com\n\nKey warnings: Keep in mind that if you pay for Early Bird Check In and then later cancel or change your flight, you will lose the benefit without a refund.\n\nHawaii\n\nWhile saver business class awards to Hawaii can be difficult to find (and even rarer in lie-flat seats), Chase has the right transfer partners to get the best values when available. Southwest is again an honorable mention since you might value the flexibility and/or find a good deal from the West Coast.\n\nSingapore KrisFlyer\n\nThe short story: Singapore KrisFlyer charges fewer miles for domestic flights to Hawaii than United does for the same flights\n\nMiles required: 17,500 miles each way in economy or 34,500 in business (as compared to 22.5K / 40K through United)\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com (Note: Do not log in — logging in may show you expanded availability based on your credit card or elite status that is not available for partner bookings) or SingaporeAir.com (See: Book United flights online with Singapore miles – but note that business class prices have increased since that post was written)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at SingaporeAir.com or over the phone with Singapore KrisFlyer\n\nKey warnings: Singapore allows a maximum connection time of 4 hours on a domestic itinerary and will not allow a stopover on a one-way award. Be aware that United.com will show availability for flights with longer/overnight connections that are not available with Singapore KrisFlyer miles, so be sure to double check availability at SingaporeAir.com before booking. Also note that transfers to Singapore KrisFlyer are not instant. Transfers typically take 12-24 hours (from all major transferable currencies) and Singapore does not hold award tickets.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThe short story: Virgin Atlantic often offers Delta flights to Hawaii for many fewer miles than Delta would charge for the same itineraries. This can be a particularly good value for Delta’s life-flat routes to Hawaii.\n\nMiles required: 20,000 miles each way in economy class or 37,500 miles each way in business class (for direct flights)\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at VirginAtlantic.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at VirginAtlantic.com.\n\nKey warnings: Virgin Atlantic charges each segment separately, so they are not a good choice for connecting itineraries.\n\nBritish Airways Avios\n\nThe short story: British Airways offers a distance-based award chart, so flights from the West Coast of the USA on Alaska Airlines or American Airlines can be a great value with Avios.\n\nMiles required: 12.5K miles each way plus $5.60 for economy-class segments between west coast cities and Hawaii.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at britishairways.com for AA or aa.com for Alaska flights.\n\nHow to book awards: Book American flights online at britishaiways.com or Alaska flights over the phone at 1 800 452 1201.\n\nKey warnings: British Airways charges for each segment separately, so multi-segment trips can get expensive quickly. Furthermore, the British Airways site sometimes shows phantom award space for AA (see: Phantom menace: an award search time suck). You may want to double-check Qantas.com for availability before transferring to British Aiways Executive Club for American flights.\n\nSouthwest\n\nThe short story: Southwest points are typically only worth about 1.5c towards the cost of a flight, but award bookings are totally flexible since they can be changed or canceled with no fee up until shortly before departure.\n\nMiles required: Varies by route but can be less than other options when cash prices are low.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Southwest.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Southwest.com\n\nKey warnings: Keep in mind that if you pay for Early Bird Check In and then later cancel or change your flight, you will lose the benefit without a refund.\n\nEurope\n\nChase has Virgin for Delta and Air France which can be good for promo awards. United may also be a good choice for Star Alliance awards as noted below.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThe short story: Virgin Atlantic often offers Delta flights for many fewer miles than Delta would charge for the same itineraries.This can be a particularly good value for Delta’s life-flat routes to Europe and availability is often surprisingly good.\n\nMiles required: 50K miles each way in business class (for direct flights)\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at VirginAtlantic.com. See: Book Delta with Virgin Atlantic miles online! (again).\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at VirginAtlantic.com.\n\nKey warnings: Virgin Atlantic charges each segment separately, so they are not a good choice for connecting itineraries. Note that taxes on flights originating in Europe can be high, but are only $5.60 when originating in the US. Some major European airports are not loaded into Virgin Atlantic’s website, so you may have to call to check availability / book.\n\nAir France / KLM Flying Blue\n\nThe short story: Monthly Flying Blue Promo Awards can sometimes offer excellent value between the US and Europe\n\nMiles required: Varies. Air France no longer has an award chart, but promo awards often offer good value, with business class awards often available in the 40K’s and sometimes as low as the 20K’s depending on destination.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at AirFrance.us (you’ll need to create a free Flying Blue frequent flyer account to search)\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at AirFrance.com. Can also book via phone.\n\nKey warnings: Air France / KLM do add fuel surcharges, though they are often reasonable (about $150-$250 in taxes and fees each way)\n\nUnited\n\nThe short story: United charges a relatively large number of miles for business class flights between the US and Europe (70K), but the lack of fuel surcharges can be a major advantage for booking partners like Luthansa.\n\nMiles required: 70K one-way in business class between the US and Europe on partner airlines and potentially less on United.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at United.com\n\nKey warnings: United has eliminated its award chart, so we may eventually see many different prices for award tickets.\n\nAsia\n\nWhile Virgin Atlantic stands out as the hands-down best value here, United also has a lot of partners in the region and Singapore gets a nod because of its expanded availability for KrisFlyer members.\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThe short story: Virgin Atlantic offers incredible value for ANA first class between the US and Japan (and decent value for business class).\n\nMiles required: 110K / 120K round trip for first class between the US West Coast / US East Coast and Japan or 90K / 95K miles in business class\n\nHow to find awards: Search United.com to find ANA partner award space.\n\nHow to book awards: Call Virgin Atlantic Flying Club at 1 800 365 9500.\n\nKey warnings: Virgin Atlantic charges each segment separately, so this award is best for direct flights. They also add fuel surcharges for ANA flights, though total taxes and fees are still quite reasonable (about $270 round trip at the time of writing).\n\nUnited\n\nThe short story: United business class for 70K each way and allows the mixing of partners and cabins, which adds more possible awards given its number of partners in Asia.\n\nMiles required: 70K miles each way in business class.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at United.com\n\nKey warnings: United has eliminated its award chart, so we may eventually see many different prices for award tickets. The $75 close-in booking fee for flights departing within the next 21 days reduces the value of United miles for bookings near departure.\n\nSingapore KrisFlyer\n\nThe short story: While award prices are high, Singapore KrisFlyer has much better availability in premium cabins for their own members. They also offer a stopover on a one-way award.\n\nMiles required: 95K / 99K from the West Coast / East Coast to Singapore in business class or 130K / 132K in first class (see the full award chart here).\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com (Note: Do not log in — logging in may show you expanded availability based on your credit card or elite status that is not available for partner bookings) or SingaporeAir.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at SingaporeAir.com or over the phone with Singapore KrisFlyer. Can waitlist as many options as you’d like as long as you have enough miles to book the award being waitlisted.\n\nKey warnings: Note that transfers to Singapore KrisFlyer are not instant. Transfers typically take 12-24 hours (from all major transferable currencies) and Singapore does not hold award tickets. Waitlisted itineraries that do not clear by 14 days prior to departure will get canceled.\n\nCaribbean / Latin America\n\nSimilar to domestic US flights, Avios can offer good value for American Airlines flights — British Airways is better for direct flights and when you need flexibility; Iberia is better for connecting itineraries and when plans are locked in (since you can not change or cancel).\n\nBritish Airways Avios\n\nThe short story: British Airways offers a distance-based award chart, so flights from the southern part of the US to the Caribbean and Latin America can be a solid value.\n\nMiles required: Varies based on distance. From 7.5K one-way in economy class.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at britishairways.com for AA or aa.com for Alaska flights.\n\nHow to book awards: Book American flights online at britishaiways.com or Alaska flights over the phone at 1 800 452 1201.\n\nKey warnings: British Airways charges for each segment separately, so multi-segment trips can get expensive quickly. Furthermore, the British Airways site sometimes shows phantom award space for AA (see: Phantom menace: an award search time suck). You may want to double-check Qantas.com for availability before transferring to British Aiways Executive Club for American flights.\n\nIberia Avios\n\nThe short story: Iberia Plus offers a distance-based award chart that can be useful for short itineraries on American Airlines (even those with connections) with no close-in booking fee. See: From 11K RT on American: A sweet spot for North American flight redemptions.\n\nMiles required: From 11K miles round trip plus $11.20 for economy-class itineraries. The best deals are itineraries of 2,000 miles flown or fewer since they cost 17,000 miles round trip at most when American has availability.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at iberia.com.\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at iberia.com.\n\nKey warnings: Most Iberia partner bookings, including those on American Airlines, are completely nonrefundable and can not be changed. Only book AA flights with Iberia if plans are certain.\n\nSouthwest\n\nThe short story: Southwest points are typically only worth about 1.5c towards the cost of a flight, but certain taxes aren’t charged on award tickets which can make for a redemption value as high as 1.9 cents per point to some Latin American destinations.\n\nMiles required: Varies by route.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at Southwest.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at Southwest.com\n\nKey warnings: Keep in mind that if you pay for Early Bird Check In and then later cancel or change your flight, you will lose the benefit without a refund.\n\nAfrica\n\nThe only real Chase Ultimate Rewards sweet spot in terms of flights from the US to Africa is United if you are able to take advantage of the Excursionist Perk (therefore picking up a free one-way within Africa). Speaking of one-ways in Africa, British Airways Avios can be useful for booking Comair to travel within southern Africa.\n\nUnited\n\nThe short story: United offers something called the “Excurionist Perk”, which gives you a free one-way within a single region when your travel begins and ends in the same region. See: Leveraging the United Excursionist Perk to save miles for some ideas. Since United partners with Egypt Air, South African, and Ethiopian, which should give you ample opportunity to take advantage of th Excusonist perk.\n\nMiles required: 70K miles each way in business class.\n\nHow to find awards: Search for available space at United.com\n\nHow to book awards: Book online at United.com\n\nKey warnings: United has eliminated its award chart, so we may eventually see many different prices for award tickets. The $75 close-in booking fee for flights departing within the next 21 days reduces the value of United miles for bookings near departure.\n\nChase Travel Portal\n\nOne final way to get decent value out of Chase points is to use them to book travel through the Chase Travel Portal, at least if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve. That’s because the CSR offers you 1.5 cents per point when using your points to book travel. Advantages here include ease and selection (since you aren’t limited by award availability). The key disadvantage is that you won’t get beyond beyond the 1.5cpp mark, but if it saves you points and works that looks like a win.\n\nBottom line\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards are a great currency to collect because they offer a nice range of partners and sweet spots. In my opinion, the factor that makes their value stand out is the ability to get a good return for your points whether booking flights or hotels, which gives you the opportunity to cherry-pick the best values.

          "description": "This past weekend, I was in Las Vegas. While Las Vegas is a love-it-or-leave-it destination for many, the undeniable fact is that it draws millions of visitors each year. When I took my first trip to Vegas almost 20 years ago, I had $258 to my name. I needed to find the various hacks to enjoy Vegas on a budget — and so I did the research to know where to get a 3/4lb hot dog for $0.99 (Westward Ho), one dollar blackjack (Sahara), a free ice cream social with Elvis (Fitzgerald’s) and all-you-can-eat pancakes for less than $3 (Riviera). None of those casinos even exist anymore (that makes me feel old), but (thankfully) I’ve moved on from chasing after cheap hot dogs to finding bigger easy wins in Las Vegas by leveraging loyalty programs and credit card benefits along with some of the traditional Las Vegas hacks. Here are a few small hacks to make your next trip a winner from the start.\n\nStatus match to Caesar’s Diamond / MGM Gold for great benefits\n\nI recently wrote about hopping on the status-match-go-round by matching credit card hotel status to Wyndham Diamond in order to end up with Caesar’s Diamond status. In Atlantic City, reports indicate that you can match that status to MGM Gold (unlikely to work in Las Vegas). Hyatt Explorist members or higher can status match to MGM Gold by linking their accounts online.\n\nEach program has some useful benefits. For example, MGM Gold status gave me access to the Gold & Platinum check-in line at Mandalay Bay. Check-in lines in Las Vegas can easily be an hour long at busy times. See this line at Mandalay Bay this past weekend:\n\nYou’ll notice the line extended into the brightly over-exposed part of that image where it wrapped around several times on the right. If you look at the left side of the desk (the side perpendicular to the check-in line), you’ll see no people waiting (maybe you can make out an agent in the distance if you zoom in on that left side of the desk). That’s where I checked in as an MGM Gold member, walking directly up to an agent without waiting at all.\n\nIn fact, avoiding the wait is one of the key benefits of status in Las Vegas as upper-level status means you can often skip the line at restaurants/buffets, rewards desks, taxi stands, etc. You’ll also get free parking — by status matching on both sides, I could have parked for free at most of the Las Vegas Strip casinos had I rented a car. It never hurts to flash your Player’s Club card in Vegas and at least ask if there are any benefits available based on your status, which could vary from discounts to free drinks.\n\nCaesar’s Diamond status is particularly good. As I previously reported in the status matching post linked above, Caesar’s Diamond status will get you 2 free show tickets each month and a “Diamond Celebration Dinner” once a year — essentially a $100 dining credit voucher. I’ll cover my experience with that in a separate post, but the short version of the story is that the credit posted quickly after matching, it was easy to use, and more than one member can use his/her celebration dinner at the same meal.\n\nHaving status with either program can also give you access to room offers that can help you save money on your stay — more on that under “even better deals for elite members” below.\n\nChase Luxury Hotels: better than Fine Hotels & Resorts for Las Vegas\n\nEnjoying free room service breakfast with a view of the planes landing at McCarran airport thanks to booking through Chase Luxury Hotel Collection.\n\nOn previous trips to Las Vegas, I’ve found American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts to provide a nice win in terms of benefits and price. My personal favorite hotel listed in the Las Vegas Fine Hotels & Resorts is Delano. I love Delano because it’s an all-suites property (true suites with a separate bedroom / living room and 2 bathrooms) and while it is connected to Mandalay Bay by a hallway, there is no casino in Delano itself. Further, you get access to the Mandalay Bay pool (“The Beach”), which includes a lazy river (that I would classify as more ambitious than lazy — it had quite a current).\n\nThe bedroom in a standard room at Delano, my preferred place to stay in Las Vegas.\n\nAs a reminder for those unfamiliar with American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts, Amex Platinum cardholders (both business and personal) can book select hotels and resorts through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts in order to receive the following benefits:\n\nDaily breakfast for 2\n\nA “local amenity” (generally some type of credit worth $100) once per stay\n\nGuaranteed 4pm late checkout\n\nNoon check-in (upon availability)\n\nRoom upgrade\n\nUnfortunately, Amex updated benefits at Las Vegas hotels last year. Whereas several Las Vegas casino resorts used to offer a $100 dining credit, all of the Las Vegas properties on FHR now  offer a spa credit for the “local amenity”. That’s not so exciting to me as I’m not much of a spa person and I know that $100 likely won’t cover most of the treatments, meaning that it’ll cost me money I didn’t intend to spend to take advantage of that benefit.\n\nHowever, this time around, I thought to check my options via Chase Luxury Hotel Collection (a program available to those with select Chase credit cards). I’ve previously written about Chase LHC and compared it to Fine Hotels & Resorts – even specifically comparing Las Vegas hotels and benefits. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that Chase Luxury Hotel Collection still offers a resort credit or food & beverage credit at many of the Las Vegas properties rather than a spa-only credit (and it further includes more Las Vegas properties than FHR, like Mandalay Bay shown below).\n\nResort credits can typically be applied to restaurant charges (at select restaurants), and I know I’ll definitely spend money on food while in Las Vegas. Furthermore, rates were decent for the first night I’d need to book in Las Vegas: Delano was available for $109 before tax and resort fee (around $160 all-in). I knew from past stays that breakfast for 2 could be eaten in the restaurant or used as a $60 credit towards room service breakfast. Essentially, I’d be paying $160 and getting $160 in credits ($60 specifically for breakfast and $100 that could be used as I pleased). That’s definitely not quite a wash as I wouldn’t ordinarily spend $60 on breakfast and tying up $100 towards a specific selection of restaurants at Mandalay Bay & Delano certainly isn’t equal to $100 cash. Still, that seemed like a good enough deal for me to book one night through Chase Luxury Hotel Collection. I was further happy when I was offered a 4pm late checkout (the Chase LHC site says it is based on availability). The late checkout meant I was able to use part of the resort credit towards lunch the next day. Also potentially notable: the $100 resort credit from Chase LHC does not need to be used in one shot and even works at Starbucks. While Starbucks did not sell gift cards, they did have plenty of merchandise. I intentionally tried charging a merchandise item to my room and sure enough it was erased by the resort credit. Note that the resort credit does not apply to service charges (like the delivery fee for in-room dining) or any gratuities.\n\nI ended up booking a single night through Chase LHC. I was actually staying in Las Vegas for 4 nights, but I did not book the next 3 through LHC. That’s because I had access to….\n\nEven better deals for elite members\n\nAs an MGM Gold member, I frequently (every week or two) receive emails from MGM properties with offers for cheap or complimentary room nights, despite not being any type of high-rolling gambler (I usually play poker if I gamble and I may sit at a $5 or $10 blackjack table for an hour now and then, though not at all on this trip). Offers run the gamut: I frequently see offers for 3 or 4 complimentary nights in standard rooms at places like Luxor and Excalibur, but may only see 1 or 2 free nights at mid-tier properties and only a discount on higher-end resorts (surely this varies some with gambling activity).\n\nFor this trip, I had received an offer for up to 2 complimentary nights at Mandalay Bay (the best offer I received for Delano was rates “from $55 per night”, though rates were higher during my dates). Looking at the availability calendar, I saw that I could book 2 nights for free at Mandalay Bay (paying just the resort fee and resort fee tax) and a third night for $25. That beat paying for additional nights at Delano through Chase Luxury Hotel Collection even though booking through the M Life offer for 2 free nights didn’t come with any dining credits. I hadn’t previously stayed at Mandalay Bay, but knew I liked the pool from past stays at Delano and since the hotels are connected it would be easy to switch rooms after spending the first night at Delano. That seemed like a win to me. More on how I parlayed this offer into something even better in a minute.\n\nAfter checking out from my stay, I’ve already received an email offer that I found interesting since I didn’t do any gambling at MGM properties, but did book one night via the Luxury Hotel Collection and subsequently charged several expensive meals to our room (since I charged meals for our entire group to my folio to collect double Hyatt points via a current promotion, which stacks with 1,000 points back per night). My new offer is for a daily dining credit:\n\nI looked up dates at Delano later this year and found that some nights are as cheap as $74 (before tax and resort fee) and stays at Delano could be booked with a $60 daily food & beverage credit. That comes out to around $125 all-in, which isn’t a bad deal when bundled with a daily $60 dining credit (though keep in mind that Chase Luxury Hotel Collection bookings do come with a daily allowance of $60 towards breakfast, so you may still be better off booking shorter stays through Chase LHC for the $100 resort credit). Offers for M life members aren’t always better than booking via Chase LHC or Amex FHR, but they can be pretty good.\n\nOn the Caesar’s side, I previously covered the fact that Caesar’s offers rooms at some resorts quite cheaply or even complimentary, and Diamond members  pay no resort fee — so free is free.\n\nOne of my family members spent a few nights at Rio before we arrived and wasn’t thrilled — though I have to imagine that for free, she might have been more forgiving. Another family member used the status match at Caesar’s to get a room at The Linq for less than it would have cost to book Excalibur.\n\nOn that note, if and when you aren’t satisfied, it’s always a good idea to:\n\nNegotiate and ask for what you want (e.g. “the $20 trick”)\n\nOne of the Las Vegas hacks you’ll hear most often referenced is “the $20 trick”. This basically refers to offering the possibility of a $20 tip to the front desk person in exchange for a complimentary upgrade. This won’t always work (and in fact may require more money at nicer properties). This is usually done by conspicuously holding a $20 bill in hand and asking if there are any complimentary upgrades. If there are (and it’s one with which you’re satisfied), you’d then pass the $20 to the desk person in between your license and credit card.\n\nI decided to give the $20 trick a try at Mandalay Bay. I was moving from Delano (where I’d booked the first night through Chase Luxury Hotel Collection) to Mandalay Bay for the next few nights under my M life Gold offer for a couple of free nights — potentially leaving a suite for a (nearly free) regular king room. Traveling with a baby, I’ve come to really value suites as our son just sleeps much better in his own space. I went to the desk at Mandalay Bay hoping to negotiate an upgrade to a suite.\n\nThe desk agent was initially pretty enthusiastic and said that he could absolutely upgrade me to a ~600 square foot “suite” that would have plenty of space, though maybe not the best view. I let him know that the view was of secondary importance to us (the extra space of a suite was key). He assured me that the room would be spacious, but then mentioned it was just one larger room with a separate sitting area, not a traditional 1-bedroom suite (something I’d more typically classify as a “junior suite”). I let him know that I was really hoping to have something with a separate bedroom so we could put the baby to bed and still be able to move around and converse without disturbing him. The agent said most of those rooms were sold out for the weekend, but he could offer me a massive 1600sq ft suite for $100 per night (couldn’t be done complimentary). I didn’t care that much about the suite (despite the fact that I’m still curious about what that room looked like). So I pushed back a little, repeating that we were really hoping for a 1-bedroom suite. He then asked me, “Do you like Delano?”. I perked up and let him know that I like it quite a bit. He then offered to move my reservation to Delano and upgrade me to a panoramic suite with a nice strip view for the same deal (2 complimentary nights plus one for $25). Um, yes please.\n\nMoral of the story: if at first you don’t get what you’re looking for, ask/bribe. Could I have gotten the huge baller suite if I’d have increased my tip offer? I think I probably could have, but I was happy to pay $20 to get a suite at Delano instead.\n\nRideshare instead of shuttle\n\nOn past trips to las Vegas, I’d taken one of the many airport shuttles offered from McCarran Airport to the strip casinos. Those shuttles typically charge from $8 per person each way to get to or from hotels on The Strip. However, if you’re traveling with at least 2 people, you can probably save money with Uber or Lyft. For example, even with an evening theater / dinner time arrival, an Uber from the airport to Delano was less than $12. Signs within the airport guide you to rideshare pickup, which is popular but we found to be pretty well organized and faster than we thought it might be after seeing the number of people waiting when we arrived.\n\nBottom line\n\nThese are just a few current Las Vegas hacks that came in handy this time around. Without wagering a dime, we walked away feeling like we won at least a little via status we didn’t quite earn and leveraging credit cards for better benefits. Those same tactics can obviously help you in places other than Las Vegas — but if you’re planning a trip to Sin City, the techniques above certainly can enhance your stay.\n\nEarn Miles Without Flying: START HERE\t\n\nThe post Las Vegas easy wins appeared first on Frequent Miler.",

          "description": "The US is in the process of increasing tariffs on essentially everything the country imports from China, meaning industries spared from previous tariff hikes are probably going to be hit now. One category where shoppers are likely to start feeling the effect on their wallets is footwear.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China accounted for nearly 60% of the footwear the US imported in 2017—and nearly all of the footwear sold in the US is imported.\n\nOn May 10, the office of the US trade representative announced it was raising tariffs from 10% to 25% on roughly $200 billion worth of goods imported from China and, at the order of US president Donald Trump, would apply unspecified increases to the $300 billion worth of Chinese goods expected to enter the country.\n\nDespite Trump’s insistence that China will pay the costs of the higher US tariffs, that’s not how tariffs work. The companies importing their goods from China are the ones who pay the duties. They can either absorb the costs and take a hit to their earnings, or they can pass the costs on to consumers by raising prices, which is what tends to be the outcome.\n\nAs Footwear News reported, Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade organization for the industry, estimated how much an additional 25% tariff on shoes would raise prices paid by consumers at the store. Their figures are based on the “landed cost” of the imported shoes, which includes the price of producing and shipping the shoes, multiplied by three—a standard retail markup that accounts for costs such as warehousing, marketing, transit, labor, and the company’s profit margin.\n\nHere are current costs for a typical pair of sneakers, boots, and children’s shoes:\n\nSneakers\n\nBoots\n\nChildren’s shoes\n\nLanded cost: $14.60\n\nLanded cost: $16.18\n\nLanded cost: $4.25\n\nCurrent duty rate: 14.1%\n\nCurrent duty rate: 37.5%\n\nCurrent duty rate: 9.52%\n\nDuty = $2.06\n\nDuty = $6.07\n\nDuty = $0.40\n\nFinal import price: $16.06\n\nFinal import price: $22.25\n\nFinal import price: $4.65\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nFinal retail: $48.18\n\nFinal retail: $66.74\n\nFinal retail: $13.96\n\nAnd here are the costs with an additional 25% tariff:\n\nSneakers\n\nBoots\n\nChildren’s shoes\n\nLanded cost: $14.60\n\nLanded cost: $16.18\n\nLanded cost: $4.25\n\nCurrent duty rate: 14.1%\n\nCurrent duty rate: 37.5%\n\nCurrent duty rate: 9.52%\n\nDuty = $2.06\n\nDuty = $6.07\n\nDuty = $0.40\n\nAdditional duty: 25%\n\nAdditional duty: 25%\n\nAdditional duty: 25%\n\nNew duty = $5.71\n\nNew duty = $10.11\n\nNew duty = $1.87\n\nNew final import price: $20.31\n\nNew final import price: $32.36\n\nNew final import price: $6.12\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nStandard retail markup: 3x\n\nNew final retail: $60.93\n\nNew final retail: $97.08\n\nNew final retail: $18.36\n\nOn a single pair of shoes, the new tariff might not seem a heavy burden, but a similar cost increase across numerous items, including clothing, can add up. Last year, another trade group, the American Apparel & Footwear Association, estimated that an additional 25% tariff would cost a family of four an extra $500 on their typical purchases of clothing and footwear alone.\n\nMaking shoes requires more specialized equipment and knowledge than sewing clothes, so it’s harder for shoe companies to move their manufacturing. But several of the largest sneaker companies, including Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour, have been diversifying their manufacturing away from China, which will help them avoid the worst.\n\nOn the whole, however, the US footwear industry is likely to feel the effect, and footwear stocks are slumping on the news of the escalating tensions.\n\nHopes for a speedy resolution to the trade war between the US and China were slim already, and now they’ve all but vanished. In response to the US hike on tariffs last week, China today said it will raise tariffs on $60 billion of imports from the US.\n",

          "description": "Why people are socializing more about crime even as it becomes rarer.\n \nViolent crime in the US is at its lowest rate in decades. But you wouldn’t know that from a crop of increasingly popular social media apps that are forming around crime.\n\nApps like Nextdoor, Citizen, and Amazon Ring’s Neighbors — all of which allow users to view local crime in real time and discuss it with people nearby — are some of the most downloaded social and news apps in the US, according to rankings from the App Store and Google Play. \n\nNextdoor bills itself as the “world’s largest social network for the neighborhood,” where you can ask for nearby restaurant recommendations, buy used furniture, or report a stolen bike. In practice, its “crime and safety” section has been a hotbed for racial stereotyping that’s forced the company to rewrite its software and policies. \n\nCitizen — whose previous form was called Vigilante and which appeared to encourage users to stop crimes in action — sends users 9-1-1 alerts for crimes happening nearby. It also allows users to livestream footage they record of the crime scene, “chat with other Citizen users as situations develop” and “build out your Inner Circle of family and friends to create your own personal safety network, and receive alerts whenever they’re close to danger.”\n\nNow Amazon has thrown its hat in the ring — with Ring. It recently advertised an editorial position that would coordinate news coverage on crime, specifically based around its Ring video doorbell and Neighbors, its attendant social media app. Neighbors alerts users to local crime news from “unconfirmed sources” and is full of Amazon Ring videos of people stealing Amazon packages and “suspicious” brown people on porches. “Neighbors is more than an app, it’s the power of your community coming together to keep you safe and informed,” it boasts. \n\nNextdoor was the ninth most-downloaded lifestyle app in the US on iPhones at the end of April, according to App Annie, an app data company; that’s up from No. 27 a year ago in the social networking category. (Nextdoor changed its app category from social to lifestyle on April 30; on April 29 it was ranked 14th in social, according to App Annie.) Amazon Ring’s Neighbors is the 36th most-downloaded social app. When it launched last year, it was 115th. Citizen, which considers itself a news app, was the seventh most-downloaded news app on iOS at the end of April, up from ninth last year and 29th in 2017.\n\nApps can fuel a vicious cycle of fear and violence\n\nThese apps have become popular because of — and have aggravated — the false sense that danger is on the rise. Americans seem to think crime is getting worse, according to data from both Gallup and Pew Research Center. In fact, crime has fallen steeply in the last 25 years according to both the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. \n\nOf course, unjustified fear, nosy neighbors, and the neighborhood watch are nothing new. But the proliferation of smart homes and smart devices is putting tools like cameras and sensors in doorbells, porches, and hallways across America. \n\nAnd as with all things technology, the reporting and sharing of the information these devices gather is easier than it used to be and its reach is wider. \n\nThese apps foment fear around crime, which feeds into existing biases and racism and largely reinforces stereotypes around skin color, according to David Ewoldsen, professor of media and information at Michigan State University. \n\n“There’s very deep research saying if we hear about or read a crime story, we’re much more likely to identify a black person than a white person [as the perpetrator],” Ewoldsen said, regardless of who actually committed the crime.\n\nAs Steven Renderos, senior campaigns director at the Center for Media Justice, put it, “These apps are not the definitive guides to crime in a neighborhood — it is merely a reflection of people’s own bias, which criminalizes people of color, the unhoused, and other marginalized communities.”\n\nExamples abound of racism on these types of apps, usually in the form of who is identified as criminal. \n\nA recent Motherboard article found that the majority of people posted as “suspicious” on Neighbors in a gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood were people of color. \n\nNextdoor has been plagued by this sort of stereotyping. \n\nCitizen is full of comments speculating on the race of people in 9-1-1 alerts.\n\nWhile being called “suspicious” isn’t of itself immediately harmful, the repercussions of that designation can be. People of color are not only more likely to be presumed criminals, they are also more likely to be arrested, abused, or killed by law enforcement, which in turn reinforces the idea that these people are criminals in the first place. \n\n“These apps can lead to actual contact between people of color and the police, leading to arrests, incarceration and other violent interactions that build on biased policing practices by law enforcement agencies across the country,” Renderos said. “And in the digital age, as police departments shift towards ‘data-driven policing’ programs, the data generated from these interactions including 9-1-1 calls and arrests are parts of the historic crime data often used by predictive policing algorithms. So the biases baked in to the decisions around who is suspicious and who is arrested for a crime ends up informing future policing priorities and continuing the cycle of discrimination.”\n\nApps didn’t create bias or unfair policing, but they can exacerbate it \n\n“To me, the danger with these apps is it puts the power in the hands of the individual to decide who does and doesn’t belong in a community,” Renderos said. “That increases the potential for communities of color to come in contact with police. Those types of interactions have wielded deadly results in the past.\n\n“Look what happened to Trayvon Martin. George Zimmerman was the watchdog. He saw someone who looked out of place and decided to do something about it.” \n\nThese apps can also be psychologically detrimental to the people who use them. \n\nIt’s natural for people to want to know more about the world around them in order to decrease their uncertainty and increase their ability to cope with danger, Ewoldsen said, so people turn to these apps.\n\n“You go on because you’re afraid and you want to feel more competent, but now you’re seeing crime you didn’t know about,” Ewoldsen said. “The long-term implication is heightened fear and less of a sense of competence. ... It’s a negative spiral.”\n\n“Focusing on these things you’re interpreting as danger can change your perception of your overall safety,” Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, told Recode. “Essentially you’re elevating your stress level. There’s buckets of research that talks about the dangers of stress, from high blood pressure to decreased mental health.”\n\nThese apps are particularly scary since they’re discussing crime nearby, within your neighborhood or Zip code. \n\n“Because it’s so close, my guess is it has a bigger impact on fear,” Ewoldsen said.\n\nWhy is this happening now?\n\nTechnology has essentially enabled people to do what they always wished they could: know what’s going on and where the danger is. Security cameras and their associated apps — like smart devices in general — are getting better and cheaper, and they’re finding their ways into more and more people’s homes. \n\nEntertainment devices like smart TVs and streaming devices are the biggest segment of smart devices sales, but smart security devices are a close second, according to data from research firm IDC. The smart security segment’s annualized growth rate is expected to be nearly 30 percent for the next three years.\n\nLike all new technology, we’re struggling to use it correctly.\n\n“When anything is new, we have a hard time figuring out how to use it,” Rutledge said. “We jump in the deep end of the pool and slowly walk to a place that makes sense.” \n\nBut why would we use something that plays on demonstrably false fears and has so many negative side effects? Some say: evolution.\n\n“We are preparing ourselves to understand the nature of our environment to increase our chances of survival,” Rutledge told Recode. “Our instinct is to get as much information as possible to figure out what’s a danger.\n\n“Wandering around on the savanna, it was much more important to know where tigers are than flowers,” she added. \n\nSo even if you’re statistically safe, the instinct is to look for what could go wrong. \n\n“You might know that only four out of 10,000 people get congenital heart disease,” Rutledge explained. “But if you’ve been one of the four that’s not reassuring. Similarly, if in your neighborhood you’re aware of things happening, the fact that crime is down 20 percent is not going to cut the mustard.” \n\nThe issue is compounded by the media, Ewoldsen says. \n\n“If you see more coverage of crime you think it’s more of an issue, even if real-world statistics say it isn’t,” Ewoldsen said.\n\nAnd all this is happening at a very contentious point in time, both politically and socially. \n\n“Some of this has to do with the general level of discord and lack of comfort societally right now,” Rutledge said. \n\nAs Ewoldsen put it, “The president screaming about crime all the time — creating a fake crisis at the border and saying immigrants are stealing jobs, that Mexico and other countries are sending criminals — is reinforcing the idea that crime is going through the roof.”\n\nThe rise of fear-based social media apps might also have to do with the decline of local news. Cuts to and closings of local newspapers over the past few decades have led to news deserts: areas that no longer have reporters to cover goings-on that aren’t on a national scale. \n\nFor better and usually worse, social media has stepped in to fill the void.\n\n“It’s about how people are exposed to news today,” Renderos said. “Social media is increasingly where people identify their source of news.”\n\nThese local social and news apps, with their air of authority and neighborhood-watch ethos, can seem like a good alternative. It’s not as though local news was immune to fear-based coverage, but new technology has the ability to amplify that type of information.\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n\nEwoldsen argues it’s a matter of media literacy and how people choose to consume media.\n\n“We need to pay attention and to be more mindful in our consumption of the news,” he said.\n\nThat means realizing what posts on these apps are and aren’t relevant to you, perhaps by decreasing the radius for which these apps display crime or by turning off notifications. People also need to be aware of how their biases and those of their fellow app users could skew reporting and the reaction to that reporting.\n\nThe responsibility also falls on the makers of the technology.\n\n“It would help if they eliminated all unverified reports,” Rutledge said. In practice, however, this would mean having to verify crimes before they could be posted, which would be very difficult if not impossible. \n\n“It would help if it would say ‘these are three important geolocated things and these things aren’t important — these aren’t threats. Here are some tips.’” \n\nCynics might say that these companies are only trying to sell more door cameras and wireless security devices and encourage more app downloads, so breeding fear is in their best interest, but Rutledge thinks the companies should take the long view. \n\n“A sustainable company will want to think about the longterm wellbeing of their customers,” Rutledge said. “Always going for a quick buck is not going to make you a sustainable company.” \n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

          "description": "Happy May! It's Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. All month long we've got recipes, stories, and long reads to celebrate the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who make America what it is today.\n\nI noticed there was a shift. I started seeing Shin Ramyun everywhere in New York City—drugstores, supermarkets, and even corner bodegas. In a local dollar store in Washington Heights, I watched a girl rush out of line (“Will you save my spot?”) to grab a couple packs of the stuff, flashing a smile at me as she returned with the red squares, “I’m obsessed with these.”\n\nI grew up with this Korean brand of instant ramen. It’s so iconic in Korean pop culture that, if there’s ever a food scene in a television drama, more often than not the character is eating Shin Ramyun out of this ramen pot. (Watch the members of K-pop sensation Girls’ Generation slurp Shin Ramyun for a whole 6-minute television segment.) To think that this grocery-store staple has become so ubiquitous would’ve been unfathomable back in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, especially where I grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.\n \nBut then again, so much has changed since then.\n \nIn 2004, H Mart came to Duluth, Georgia, and it was a sign that Korean immigrants had truly arrived. In that same year, the Italian restaurant where I had my first date with an old girlfriend became a Korean fried chicken restaurant, and the local Blockbuster turned into a Korean bakery. Koreans were finally establishing their own community in the predominately white Georgia suburbs of Fulton County—not just a place for them to shop for groceries, but also a communal space for them to see friends, neighbors, and fellow Koreans.\n\nH Mart is to Korean immigrants in America as Patel Brothers is to Indian immigrants in America: a grocery store, of course, but also a marker of a moment in time and space, when a cultural need for belonging gave way to venture capital.\n \nIn the time since H Mart first opened back in 1982, Sandra Oh has won an Emmy, the word gochujang has been added to the dictionary, and Yakult has flown off the shelves because of a Netflix film based on a novel written by a Korean-American writer. Like these cultural moments, the ubiquity of H Mart, too, is a sign that Korean food is on its way to becoming mainstream.\n \nAnd so, with unbridled excitement in my Korean-American heart, I offer you my veritable list of the very best things to buy at H Mart, America's most-beloved Korean grocery store.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nPhoto by H Mart \n\n1. Short-grain white rice\n \nIt’s the first thing you’ll see when you walk in: a wall of short-grain rice options. My favorite brand is Kokuho Rose sushi rice—but just go for the cheapest. Fun fact: The packaging will all look Japanese, but that’s because most Korean rice is, historically, Japanese.\n \n2. Kimchi\n \nContrary to popular belief, most Koreans don’t actually make their own kimchi. It might be a seasonal activity for certain home cooks, but many just buy their everyday stash at H Mart. Even my mother! That's because H Mart makes perfectly good kimchi, as long as you wait till it ferments before eating (usually a couple weeks in the fridge, or if you're really impatient, overnight on the counter). There are many varieties: kkakduki (\"Country Style Cubed Radish Kimchi,\" the label might read), chonggak (young \"bachelor\" radish), and regular cabbage kimchi (with or without oysters).\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nPhoto by H Mart \n\n3. Instant ramen\n \nAgain, Shin Ramyun is the go-to, but I often get Shin Ramyun Black, which has thicker noodles and an extra seolleongtang bone broth soup mix packet that adds nice depth. Or sometimes I opt for Ichiban (beef flavor) because it's what my mom would cook for my brother and me after long days at the pool. There are so many varieties and brands of instant noodles at H Mart that are worth exploring. My cousin Becky goes to H Mart just to see what's new on the shelf: These days you can get instant jjajangmyeon, jjamppong, and even carbonara-inspired ramen.\n \n4. Roasted seaweed snack\n \nAlso known as gim, seaweed snack is Korean-style nori that's been brushed with sesame oil, salted, then roasted. We ate it as a side dish growing up, or as a vehicle for leftover rice balls in the morning. As an adult, I've learned to incorporate it into my recipes because I find that it adds a nuanced salinity that salt or soy alone can't provide. You'll find it in my avocado toast, deviled eggs, and even scrambled eggs. The Great Wall of Gim at H Mart is proof enough of this pantry item's lasting importance in the Korean diet.\n\nThe gim selection at H Mart takes up nearly an entire aisle. Photo by Eric Kim \n\n5. Korean snacks, chips & candies\n \nMy brother shops at H Mart for one thing and for one thing alone: the snacks. See below for a few of our personal favorites growing up: Goraebab, which translates to \"whale food,\" is an umami-packed tomato-flavored chip that's dangerously good (1); Shrimp Flavored Cracker is a classic, and exactly what it sounds like (2); Sweet Potato Snack is a lovely sweet cracker studded with black sesame seeds (3); and Onion Flavored Rings are a cleaner-tasting Funyun (4).\n \n\"Also, I never make it out without at least one thing of Hi-Chew,\" Software Engineer Micki Balder tells me.\n\n1. Goraebab \n\n2. Shrimp Flavored Cracker \n\n3. Sweet Potato Snack \n\n4. Onion Flavored Rings Photo by H Mart \n\n6. Korean ice cream\n \nKorea has great ice cream, too. I'm particularly fond of the Samanco cake cone ice cream sandwiches filled with sweet red bean (there's also a strawberry version that I sometimes prefer). Another favorite is Melona, a creamy ice pop flavored with honeydew. You can also stock up on green tea and red bean ice cream at H Mart—and don't leave without those little mochi ice cream bites.\n \n5. Pantry staples & specialty ingredients (depending on who's asking)\n \nH Mart is where I come to stock my Korean pantry: sesame oil, soy sauce, gochujang (red pepper paste), gochugaru (red pepper powder), black bean paste, tofu, and miso. They have a wide selection of Japanese pickles, as well, which are lovely to keep on hand. “I like to get containers of pickled ginger from the fridge section,\" Lifestyle Writer Ella Quittner says. \"I eat it as a snack, sometimes dipped in a bit of soy.\"\n \nSenior Social Media Manager Connor Bower buys those \"large, teabag-like packets filled with dried anchovies, kelp, and shiitake mushrooms used to make anchovy stock two cups at a time.\" Many a Korean recipe starts with anchovy stock, including tteokbokki, gyeranjjim, and budae jjigae. \"It's been so useful to have on hand whenever I want to make one dish,\" Connor admits, \"as I'm not sure I'd be able to go through large quantities of the anchovies and kelp by myself.\"\n\nA miso for all of my personalities. Photo by Eric Kim \n\n\"I love buying the golden curry packets, fish balls, and fish sauce,\" Account Manager Rebekah Daniels chimes in.\n \n\"I got amazing mushroom soy sauce when I was in Thailand,\" VP of Finance Victoria Maynard adds.\n \n\"Sweet chili garlic sauce,\" Micki waxes lyrical. \"That stuff tastes good on everything, but I especially like it lacquered on fish.\"\n \n9. Really fresh seafood\n \nSpeaking of fish, H Mart's fish selection is very good. I love getting the individual salmon fillets—always center cut, but sometimes, if it's available, I get the cheek and roast it low and slow. Tastes incredible with fresh white rice.\n \n\"I get my blue crabs from there,\" says Sales Director Lizzie Greene. \"They also have pre-packaged crabs with their roe and fat saved for making crab stock or butter.\"\n \n10. Bones for bone broth\n \nOne of my favorite Korean dishes is the aforementioned seolleongtang, a milky bone broth made from brisket and difficult-to-find cuts of beef, namely knee, leg, and shin bones. Head to the H Mart freezer section, where they sell these bones, labeled \"Beef Bones,\" either in large plastic bags or packaged like this.\n\n H Mart is to Korean immigrants in America as Patel Brothers is to Indian immigrants in America: a grocery store, of course, but also a marker of a moment in time and space, when a cultural need for belonging gave way to venture capital. \n\n11. Fruits & vegetables\n \nMy cousins and I joke that H Mart produce is twice the size of regular fruits and vegetables (but it really is, and often cheaper too). Plus, H Mart is a great source for the harder-to-find varieties like dragonfruit, jackfruit, papaya, durian, Korean Concord grapes, melons, and Asian pear. So don't forget to stock up on fresh fruit while you're there, and if you are one of those go-getters who plans to make their own kimchi at home, this is where you can buy all of that fresh napa cabbage and the FATTEST scallions you've ever seen.\n\nFancy prepackaged tropical fruit, I love you. Photo by Eric Kim \n\nJust two or three of these, paired with a bowl of white rice, and you've got yourself a whole meal. Photo by Eric Kim \n\n12. Prepared banchan\n \nThere's a whole wall of prepared foods and banchan, or small Korean side dishes, such as: pickled garlic, fried anchovies, spicy octopus and squid, spinach, black beans, lotus root, perilla leaf, seaweed salad, brined cod roe, and even little Korean-style omelets and pancakes, or jeon.\n \n13. Frozen dumplings\n \nThink: Trader Joe's dumplings, but way better. And more variety, too: Korean mandoo, Japanese gyoza, Chinese baos and shumai, etc.\n \n14. Home goods\n \nThough this seems less intuitive, H Mart's kitchen selection is pretty extensive. It's where nearly every newly minted Korean adult will go to buy a couple of key items for a starter pack to life: a rice cooker and this lightweight plated aluminum pot (which brings water to a boil way faster than a regular pot, making it ideal for instant ramen). Also, stock up on pretty chopsticks, spoons, forks, and little rice and soup bowls. Or if you're like me and secretly love kawaii things, don't miss THIS totally cute cat tea cup!\n\nMeow.

          "description": "This year, Ramadan starts on May 5. But what is Ramadan? How does fasting work? Your questions, answered.\n \nThe Muslim holy month of Ramadan starts on Sunday, May 5, and most of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims will observe it. This means there's a good chance you might encounter someone — a friend, a co-worker, the barista making your latte at Starbucks, your child's teacher — who will be celebrating, fasting, and doing all sorts of other activities that are unique to the holy month.\n\nBut what is Ramadan, exactly? And how can I make sure I don't accidentally offend my Muslim friends and acquaintances during Ramadan celebrations?\n\nWe've got you covered: Here are the most basic answers to the most basic questions about Ramadan.\n\n1) What is Ramadan actually about?\n\nRamadan is the most sacred month of the year for Muslims — the Prophet Mohammed reportedly said, \"When the month of Ramadan starts, the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained.\"\n\nMuslims believe it was during this month that God revealed the first verses of the Quran, Islam's sacred text, to Mohammed, on a night known as \"The Night of Power\" (or Laylat al-Qadr in Arabic).\n\n Related London's new Muslim mayor has the perfect response to Trump making an \"exception\" for him \n\nDuring the entire month of Ramadan, Muslims fast every day from dawn to sunset. It is meant to be a time of spiritual discipline — of deep contemplation of one's relationship with God, extra prayer, increased charity and generosity, and intense study of the Quran.\n\nBut if that makes it sound super serious and boring, it's really not. It's a time of celebration and joy, to be spent with loved ones. At the end of Ramadan there’s a big three-day celebration called Eid al-Fitr, or the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast. It's kind of like the Muslim version of Christmas, in the sense that it's a religious holiday where everyone comes together for big meals with family and friends, exchanges presents, and generally has a lovely time.\n\nCem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nEid presents!!!\n\nDespite the hardship of fasting for a whole month, most Muslims (myself included) actually look forward to Ramadan and are a little sad when it's over. There's just something really special about knowing that tens of millions of your fellow Muslims around the world are experiencing the same hunger pangs, dry mouth, and dizzy spells that you are, and that we're all in it together.\n\n2) How does fasting work?\n\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars — or duties — of Islam, along with the testimony of faith, prayer, charitable giving, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. All Muslims are required to take part every year, though there are special dispensations for those who are ill, pregnant or nursing, menstruating, or traveling, and for young children and the elderly.\n\nThe practice of fasting serves several spiritual and social purposes: to remind you of your human frailty and your dependence on God for sustenance, to show you what it feels like to be hungry and thirsty so you feel compassion for (and a duty to help) the poor and needy, and to reduce the distractions in life so you can more clearly focus on your relationship with God.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating any food, drinking any liquids, smoking cigarettes, and engaging in any sexual activity, from dawn to sunset. That includes taking medication (even if you swallow a pill dry, without drinking any water). Chewing gum is also prohibited (though I didn't find that one out until about halfway through my first Ramadan after converting — oops).\n\nDoing any of those things \"invalidates\" your fast for the day, and you just start over the next day. To make up for days you didn't fast, you can either fast later in the year (either all at once or a day here and there) or provide a meal to a needy person for each day you missed.\n\nMuslims are also supposed to try to curb negative thoughts and emotions like jealousy and anger, and even lesser things like swearing, complaining, and gossiping, during the month. Some people may also choose to give up or limit activities like listening to music and watching television, often in favor of listening to recitations of the Quran.\n\n3) What is a typical day like during Ramadan?\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims wake up well before dawn to eat the first meal of the day, which has to last until sunset. This means eating lots of high-protein foods and drinking as much water as possible right up until dawn, after which you can't eat or drink anything. At dawn, we perform the morning prayer. Since it's usually still pretty early, many go back to sleep for a bit before waking up again to get ready for the day (I certainly do).\n\nMuslims are not supposed to avoid work or school or any other normal duties during the day just because we are fasting. In many Muslim countries, however, businesses and schools may reduce their hours during the day or close entirely. For the most part, though, Muslims go about their daily business as we normally would, despite not being able to eat or drink anything the whole day.\n\nWhen the evening call to prayer is finally made (or when the alarm on your phone's Muslim prayer app goes off), we break the day's fast with a light meal — really more of a snack — called an iftar (literally \"breakfast\"), before performing the evening prayer. Many also go to the mosque for the evening prayer, followed by a special prayer that is only recited during Ramadan.\n\nThis is usually followed by a larger meal a bit later in the evening, which is often shared with family and friends in one another's homes throughout the month. Then it's off to bed for a few hours of sleep before it's time to wake up and start all over again.\n\n(Note: There are good reasons for only having a small snack to break your fast before performing the evening prayer and then eating a bigger meal later. Muslim prayers involve a lot of movement — bending over, prostrating on the ground, standing up, etc. Doing all that physical activity on a full stomach after not having eaten for 15 hours is a recipe for disaster. Just trust me on this one.)\n\n4) So do you lose weight during Ramadan?\n\nSome of you may be thinking, \"Wow, that sounds like a great way to lose weight! I'm going to try it!\" But in fact, Ramadan is actually notorious for often causing weight gain. That's because eating large meals super early in the morning and late at night with a long period of low activity bordering on lethargy in between can wreak havoc on your metabolism.\n\nBut if you're careful, you can avoid putting on weight, and you may actually lose a few pounds. One meta-analysis of scientific studies on the effects of Ramadan fasting on body weight found that \"[w]eight changes during Ramadan were relatively small and mostly reversed after Ramadan, gradually returning to pre-Ramadan status. Ramadan provides an opportunity to lose weight, but structured and consistent lifestyle modifications are necessary to achieve lasting weight loss.\" [Italics mine.]\n\nSo just like with any other extreme diet plan, you may lose a few pounds, but unless you actually make \"structured and consistent lifestyle modifications,\" you're probably not going to see major, lasting results.\n\n5) Why do the dates of Ramadan change every year?\n\nFor religious matters, Muslims follow a lunar calendar — that is, one based on the phases of the moon — whose 12 months add up to approximately 354 days. That's 11 days shorter than the 365 days of the standard Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the Islamic lunar calendar moves backward approximately 11 days each year in relation to the regular Gregorian calendar.\n\nSo that means that the first day of the month of Ramadan, which is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, moves backward by about 11 days each year.\n\nThis has a large impact on how people experience Ramadan from year to year. When Ramadan falls in the winter, it's much easier to fast: the days are shorter, which means you don't have to fast as long, and it's colder out, so not being able to drink water all day isn't as big of a deal because you're not sweating as much.\n\nConversely, when Ramadan falls in the summer, fasting can be brutal. In many Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, summer temperatures can reach levels usually reserved for the deepest bowels of hell.\n\nAnd in some Northern European countries such as Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (where, yes, there are Muslims), fasting can last an average of 20 hours or more in the summer. (And in a few places above the Arctic Circle, the sun never actually sets in the summer. In these cases, Muslim religious authorities have decreed that Muslims can either fast along with the closest Muslim country or fast along with Mecca, Saudi Arabia.)\n\n6) Okay, but why is there always confusion every year about exactly what day Ramadan starts on?\n\nThere's a reason \"Ramadan start date\" is one of the most-searched phrases every single year. That's because Muslims around the world do not know when exactly Ramadan is actually supposed to start. If you Google it, you'll see there's a little disclaimer under Google's answer that says \"Dates may vary\":\n\nThat also has to do with the moon — as well as disagreements about science, history, and tradition, plus a bit of geopolitical rivalry.\n\nThe beginning of each new month in the Islamic calendar starts on the new moon. Which means the month of Ramadan starts on the new moon. Simple enough, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIf it's been a while since your high school astronomy class, here's a reminder of what the phases of the moon look like:\n\nGriffith Observatory\n\nPictured: the source of much consternation and hilarity every single Ramadan.\n\nBack in Mohammed's day, in sixth-century Arabia, astronomical calculations weren't as precise as they are today, so people went by what they could see with the naked eye.\n\nSince the new moon isn't actually super visible in the night sky (as you can see above), Muslims traditionally waited to start fasting until the small sliver of crescent moon became visible. There's even a saying attributed to the Prophet Mohammed about waiting to start the fast until you see the crescent. (Some people think this is why the star and crescent is the symbol of Islam, but the crescent was used as a symbol long before Islam.)\n\nThis method was a bit messy, though, since things like clouds or just the difficulty of spotting the moon in some locations often led to different groups starting their fast on separate days, even within the same country. Each community, village, or even mosque within the village might send its own guy out to look for the crescent, with rival groups arguing over whether the other guy really saw it.\n\nToday, however, we have precise scientific calculations that tell us exactly when the new moon begins, and we don't need to wait until someone spots a tiny crescent in the sky. (In fact, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, \"The need to determine the precise appearance of the hilal [crescent moon] was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy.\")\n\nSo, problem solved! Except that some Muslim scholars believe we should still wait until the slight crescent moon is visible in the night sky because that's what Mohammed said to do and that's the way we've always done it.\n\nOthers argue that Islam has a strong tradition of reason, knowledge, and science, and that if Mohammed were around today, he'd choose the more precise scientific calculations over sending the guy at the mosque with the best eyesight outside to squint at the night sky.\n\nTo make things even more fun, some argue that the whole world should just follow the official moon-sighting decrees of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the location of its holiest sites. But not everyone thinks that's such a swell idea — especially rival countries like Pakistan and Iran, which balk at the idea of treating Saudi Arabia as the ultimate authority on anything having to do with Islam.\n\nAll this means that each year, Muslims around the world get to experience the delightful lunacy of \"moon-sighting fighting.\" Indeed, it's such a familiar feature of Ramadan that there are memes about it:\n\nYes, Muslims use this meme too. There's really no escaping it.\n\n7) Are there differences between how Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims observe Ramadan?\n\nFor the most part, no. Both Sunni and Shia Muslims fast during Ramadan. But there are some minor differences — for instance, Sunnis break their daily fast at sunset, when the sun is no longer visible on the horizon (but there's still light in the sky), whereas Shia wait until the redness of the setting sun has completely vanished and the sky is totally dark.\n\nShia also celebrate an additional holiday within the month of Ramadan that Sunnis do not. For three days — the 19th, 20th, and 21st days of Ramadan — Shia commemorate the martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed who was both the revered fourth caliph of Sunni Islam and the first \"legitimate\" imam (leader) of Shia Islam.\n\nAli was assassinated in the fierce civil wars that erupted following the death of Mohammed over who should lead the Muslim community in his stead. On the 19th day of the month of Ramadan, while Ali was worshipping at a mosque in Kufa, Iraq, an assassin from a group of rebels who opposed his leadership fatally struck him with a poisoned sword. Ali died two days later.\n\nAli is a hugely important figure in Shia Islam. His tomb in nearby Najaf, Iraq, is the third-holiest site in Shia Islam, and millions of Shia make a pilgrimage there every year. Although Sunnis revere Ali as one of the four \"rightly guided\" caliphs who ruled after Mohammed's death, they do not commemorate his death or make a pilgrimage to his tomb.\n\nToushiro, public domain\n\nThe tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib in Najaf, Iraq.\n\n8) What can I do to be respectful of my Muslim friends during Ramadan?\n\nIn some Muslim countries, it is a crime to eat and drink in public during the day in the month of Ramadan, even if you're not Muslim.\n\nOf course, this is not the case in the United States, where we enjoy freedom of (and freedom from) religion. And most American Muslims, myself included, don't expect the non-Muslims around us to radically change their behavior to accommodate our religious fast during Ramadan.\n\nI've had friends and co-workers who have chosen to fast along with me out of solidarity (or just because it seems \"fun\"), and that was sweet of them, but it's not something I ever expected people to do. (Plus, they usually last about four days before they decide solidarity is overrated and being thirsty for 15 hours is not even remotely \"fun.\")\n\nAll that said, there are things you can do, and not do, to make things a little easier for friends or colleagues who happen to be fasting for Ramadan. If you share an office with someone fasting, maybe eat your delicious, juicy cheeseburger in the office break room rather than at your desk, where your poor, suffering Muslim co-workers will have to smell it and salivate (if they even have enough moisture left in their bodies to salivate at that point).\n\nTry to remember not to offer them a bite or a sip of what you're eating, because it's sometimes hard for us to remember that we're fasting and easy to absentmindedly accept and eat that Lay's potato chip you just offered us. But if you do, it's okay. We're not going to get mad or be offended (unless you're doing it on purpose, in which case, what is wrong with you?).\n\nIf you're having a dinner party and you want to invite your Muslim friends, try to schedule it after sunset so they can eat. Muslims don't drink alcohol or eat pork, but we usually don't mind being around it. (Contrary to popular belief, we are not scared of or allergic to pork; we just don't eat it. It's not like we're vampires and pork is garlic.) But do let us know if there's alcohol or pork in something so we don't accidentally consume it.\n\nIf you want to wish your Muslim friends or acquaintances a happy Ramadan or happy Eid al-Fitr, you're welcome to just say, \"Happy Ramadan!\" or \"Happy Eid!\" That's not offensive or anything. But if you want to show them you made an effort to learn more about their religion, the standard greetings are \"Ramadan/Eid kareem\" (which means \"have a generous Ramadan/Eid\") or \"Ramadan/Eid mubarak\" (which means \"have a blessed Ramadan/Eid\").\n\nEven something as simple as learning one of those expressions and saying it with a smile to your Muslim friends will go a long way toward making them feel comfortable and welcome.\n\n9) So if you're not supposed to get angry or complain or gossip during Ramadan, how come terrorist attacks by groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda always seem to spike during Ramadan?\n\nBecause terrorists are assholes.\n\nWatch: Muhammad Ali's biggest fights were outside the ring\n",

Earlier this year researchers for an aid group found that garment workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam making clothes for big international labels were paid so little they couldn’t adequately feed themselves. A new report found that female garment workers in Vietnam face “systemic” sexual harassment and violence at work.\n\nThese are just some of the recent examples. In 2013, the industry became a global symbol of worker exploitation when the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed on the outskirts of Dhaka in Bangladesh, killing around 1,134 people and ranking as one of the worst industrial disasters in history.\n\nThe massive and deadly factory collapse at Rana Plaza.\n\nJust over two decades ago, a small collection of workers’ rights groups, trade unions, British retailers, and others joined together to take action on the poor pay and labor conditions that countless workers in global supply chains endure. The organization they ultimately formed, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), has since founded programs in countries around the world, partnered with other advocacy groups, and elicited commitments from brands large and small—including some of the world’s biggest fashion labels—to try to improve workers’ lives.\n\nBut while it has done a lot of good, it hasn’t been able to eradicate the problems that led to its creation. “Last year was our 20th anniversary, and in many ways, we haven’t seen the kind of progress that we’d like to see,” says Martin Buttle, ETI’s strategic lead on general merchandise and business models. “We’ve seen the same stories and same kind of problems reoccur in various different sourcing countries since when we started working in this field.”\n\nIn fashion—particularly the low-cost, high-volume sort—this has certainly been the case. And after two decades working to solve these problems, the group felt the need to reassess its approach as it prepares to set its strategy for the next few years. The group has always focused on brands’ business practices, but it has recognized the need to take a step back and look at the whole premise the industry operates on. “I think we’ve been increasingly conscious that the business model is part of the issue,” Buttle says.\n\nThe ETI commissioned a team of authors, including professors at the business schools of King’s College London and the University of Warwick, to examine the connection between business models in fashion and food and labor standards in the supply chains of those industries. The new report, “Business Model and Labour Standards: Making the Connection,” argues that the model of producing giant volumes of clothing at the highest speed and lowest cost, through a flexible and opaque global supply chain, has been a key contributor to the hazardous conditions, labor abuses, and low wages that workers face in the industry.\n\nAll the factory inspections that brands carry out on their suppliers, all their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, and the millions they spend on them, may help to improve conditions, but only in limited ways. They’re effectively treating symptoms rather than the disease.\n\nTo really make sure workers aren’t routinely exploited in countries around the world, individual fixes won’t solve the problem. The whole business model needs to change.\n\nFashion’s common ground\n\nThere isn’t really just one business model in fashion, even within the low-cost clothing sector. Zara works differently from Walmart: The former emphasizes constant, smaller deliveries of new styles to keep up with trends; the latter relies on selling higher volumes of more basic items. Even so, there’s a lot these brands share in terms of how they get their clothing made. The ETI report centers on these common ways of operating, since those are at the nexus of the relationship between the brands, factory owners, and workers. And that’s where the roots of the industry’s problems lie.\n\nFirst off, very few brands own the factories that make their clothes. They outsource the work to independent producers, usually in countries where labor is cheap. Their supply chains also tend to be highly flexible, in that they can change the factories they source from without too much disruption. Lastly, they’re continually trying to make clothes faster, as they work to keep pace with customers who are moving at the pace of social media.\n\nTrends can come and go in a matter of weeks now. If it takes a brand a few months to design, manufacture, and ship clothing, it can miss its chance to cash in. Shoppers reward the fastest brands, offering them the best value for their investment in manufacturing.\n\nTo make all the inexpensive fashion that brands pack into stores and websites, they have come to rely on a complex network of contractors and subcontractors that can be nearly impossible to monitor and regulate. They are constantly assessing how to produce their clothes in the most cost-efficient way possible. They get quotes from factories in different countries, sometimes using middlemen who know where to find the best deals, and go with the ones that offer that best mix of price, speed, and quality. Or they set draconian terms that factories in need of the work may be reluctant to reject. As the ETI report frames it, clothing brands “have become adept at dissecting the supply chain and looking for pockets of ‘value’ that can be ring-fenced and negotiated downwards.”\n\nBut the longer and more dispersed the supply chain becomes, the harder it is to keep an eye on everything happening within it. The intense pressure to keep prices low and churn out clothes quickly pushes the suppliers themselves to outsource work, and the brand at one end of the supply chain can lose control over what’s happening at the other end.\n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n Fleece coats are a key item this season.

In countries where industry isn’t well-regulated, factory owners may cut corners on safety, failing to install proper fire doors, or skipping important upgrades.\n\nBrands can also fail to give their suppliers enough lead time to produce their orders, or may suddenly demand larger quantities or add other changes. This leads to factory owners forcing staff to work overtime without extra pay, or finding other ways to get the work done. The ETI’s report cites the combination of these factors and the lack of visibility across the supply chain, saying it “influences the adoption of unethical practices by suppliers.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW), an advocacy group dedicated to uncovering abuses around the world, just released its own report on the garment industry. Like ETI, it concludes that brands’ purchasing practices—meaning how they place orders with manufacturers—are driving labor violations: “Low purchase prices and shorter times for manufacturing products, coupled with poor forecasting, unfair penalties, and poor payment terms, exacerbate risks for labor abuses in factories,” it states.\n\nEven the most robust corporate social responsibility efforts are undermined in this cycle. “Often, bad purchasing practices directly undermine efforts brands are making to try to ensure rights-respecting conditions in the factories that produce their wares,” HRW points out. “Many brands demand their suppliers maintain rights-respecting workplaces, but then incentivize them to do the opposite.”\n\nWorkers in Myanmar and Cambodia, for example, saw their production targets increased significantly when the country raised the minimum wage. The workers got paid more, HRW reports, but the factories then demanded more. Workers could be denied basic rights such as bathroom breaks.\n\nA garment factory in Myanmar.\n\nPerhaps the worst instances of underpayment, worker abuses, and dangerous conditions occur in the unauthorized subcontracting sector. The factory a brand contracted with might subcontract out work to another factory when it has accepted an order and then finds itself unable to fill it as fast as promised. Or it may even take the order knowing it can’t complete it in time, just because it doesn’t want to say no and risk the brand going elsewhere with its business.\n\nThese subcontracting factories are less likely to be registered with the governments of their countries, and may operate outside of any regulation or oversight. The facilities that collapsed at Rana Plaza, for example, housed subcontractors producing for large international brands, such as Benetton.\n\nBrands may ban vendors from subcontracting, but the demands they make and conditions they impose still set the stage for it. HRW spoke to one sourcing expert with more than 30 years in the garment industry, who explained, “If a brand says [to a factory] they are going to order 150,000 pieces and then at the time of actually placing the order, turn around and ask for 250,000 pieces, then you are going to have OT [overtime] or subcontracting.”\n\nThe authors of the ETI report note that, based on their research in Bangladesh, brand sourcing managers and middlemen are often aware of the production limits of factories. And if they place orders that exceed them anyway, “they invite sub-contracting with ‘eyes wide shut.'”\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe global supply chain of the fashion industry is relatively new. Up through the 19th century, ready-made clothing that a person could buy off a rack was mostly an alien concept, as Grace Rogers Cooper wrote in her history of the sewing machine. For the most part, those with the means got their clothes made to order from tailors or seamstresses, and those who didn’t made their own, or wore hand-me-downs. In the US, until about the 1830s ready-made garments were almost exclusively for sailors about to ship out to sea.\n\nBut in cities in such as New York, as incomes rose and a steady rush of immigrants and others flooded in, a market emerged for convenient ready-made clothes. As more people jumped into the business, prices fell. The invention of a practical sewing machine only spurred the process. In 1860, the New York Times compared it to the “domestic” equivalent of the telegraph or reaper. Slowly, clothing manufacture was industrializing, and affordable fashion for the masses becoming a reality.\n\nAs the industry grew, so did pressure to make things more cheaply. “There was always outsourcing in the industry,” says Doug Miller, an emeritus professor of workers’ rights and fashion at the University of Northumbria. In the US, for example, manufacturing started to migrate “away from the urban centers into Pennsylvania and beyond in the Southern states,” he notes.\n\nMiller calls clothing manufacturers “footloose,” because it’s fairly cheap to move production around. To sew clothing doesn’t require a prohibitive amount of specialized knowledge or equipment. “Once you had improvements in transport and communication,” he says, “it just was a matter of time before it went international.”\n\nThat process took off in the late 1960s and 1970s, as businesses that once manufactured clothing started outsourcing the work to cheaper destinations such as Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan, as well as Central America and the Caribbean. When wages rose in those locales, they turned to Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Turkey.\n\nAnd of course, to mainland China: In 1979, it started a process of economic reforms that would transform it in the decades that followed from a poor backwater that subsisted on farming to an export-oriented economy (pdf) that would grow into the largest producer of clothing in the world.\n\nThere were still companies such as Levi’s that owned the factories where they made their clothes, but they were losing ground. Even Levi’s eventually outsourced its production. In wealthier countries, textile mills and garment factories fought the outsourcing, and governments, in an effort to protect local industry, put restraints on how much clothing, and what types, they would allow in from developing countries. It wasn’t enough. Even with the barriers, production flowed to countries that offered labor costs no industrialized economy could compete with.\n\nGarment workers in New York protest the influx of clothing imports from overseas in 1977.\n\nAs author Elizabeth Cline detailed in her book, Overdressed: The shockingly high cost of cheap fashion, giant garment factories employing thousands of people in low-wage nations sprang up to fulfill the massive orders of Western labels. Companies such as Gap and Nike were among the pioneers, coming up with products and marketing campaigns to whip up demand which they satisfied with an avalanche of products made through outsourced production, keeping costs low and margins high.\n\nThis model is still in use today, only it has gotten much faster. And it has had economic consequences in wealthier countries too. In the advanced capitalist economies of the 1950s and 1960s, there was a “virtuous circle of production and consumption,” according to the authors of ETI report. As real wages rose for workers producing goods, their purchasing power increased, lifting the demand for goods. Prices rose, too, but wages kept up, while the desire for more products fueled a cycle of more employment and higher wages to make them. It sometimes required workers getting those increases through collective bargaining, but the model generally worked.\n\nWhen these jobs moved overseas, that virtuous cycle ceased to exist, according to the ETI:\n\nGlobal Supply Chains have broken this model. They have separated spatially those who produce the goods and those who consume the goods. To deliver lower priced goods, separation of consumers from producers is necessary. Buyers threaten to relocate or actually relocate should wage costs rise. As such, the model is the opposite of the virtuous circle as it seeks out workers who do not have a reasonable prospect of being able to consume the type of goods which they produce.\n\nIn theory, free trade should make the situation advantageous to all, freeing up workers in the advanced economies to do better jobs and giving the workers in the developing nations jobs that will lead eventually to higher wages and living standards. But free trade doesn’t always work in practice the way it does in theory. Particularly for countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and others, cheap labor has been perhaps the top competitive advantage when it comes to attracting the fashion and footwear industries. For these countries to remain attractive to international brands, their wages may have to remain low.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, shoppers are spending a diminishing share of their disposable income on clothing, even as they stuff their closets with more of it. Clothing prices have been deflating compared to retail overall, and brands keep looking for ever-cheaper ways to fill the demand.\n\nConstant downward price pressure\n\nThe ideal sourcing destinations globally, not by coincidence, are the ones that offer the best mix of price, speed, and quality, though brands prioritize each of those factors differently.\n\nA label that wants to fill its stores in Europe with, say, a newly hot style of shirt may opt to make it in Turkey or Morocco (even at a higher cost than in Southeast Asia), since it can get it from idea to store shelf weeks sooner. Zara does much of its production near Europe for this reason, and as the need for brands to produce faster grows, more may start looking to countries nearer the markets they sell in. China, meanwhile, remains by far the world’s largest clothing exporter, even though prices have been rising there for years, because it has built up an unmatched infrastructure that, for now at least, still allows the quality and efficiency of its manufacturing to offset the added expense.\n\nEven so, price arguably carries a disproportionate amount of weight when brands balance out these factors. As a business, high-volume, low-cost fashion has narrow margins, so even a small additional expense to make something like a t-shirt can have a big impact on a brand’s profits when it’s making tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of them.\n\nShockingly low wages and abundant labor are part of the reason Bangladesh has grown into the world’s second-largest clothing exporter—with the EU as its main export destination. For brands, Buttle says, cost “is definitely a very significant driver…There’s a reason they’re all sourcing from countries with the lowest labor costs, and where labor regulations are weakly enforced.”\n\nA factory that supplies H&M in Kandal province, Cambodia.\n\nBrands, though, aren’t the ones setting the wages directly. David Sävman, head of production at H&M, which is an ETI member, says it’s a common misconception that brands decide what garment workers get paid. Again, they don’t own the factories. It’s the local industry and government that determine wages, and a worker’s pay doesn’t change according to which brand she’s sewing for.\n\nThat’s not to say, however, that there’s no correlation between wages and what a consumer ultimately pays. “On a single order, there would be no connection between worker wage and final garment price,” Sävman says. “But on a total of how a market develops, yes.”\n\nWhile the brands are all competing to get their clothes in front of shoppers as fast as they can at the lowest possible price, the factories are in competition too. They need to get orders from the brands to make money themselves, so the factory owners offer the best prices they can manage, at the fastest turnaround times. To make a profit, they have to keep their own costs low, so they pay the lowest wages they can.\n\nAnd then there are the workers. To sew clothing quickly and correctly all day long requires a tremendous amount of skill, but it’s not the same sort required for writing computer code or designing high-end electronics. It’s often developed through repetition, not formal education, so factories may treat garment workers as interchangeable. They can also be some of the most disadvantaged people in a community, making them even more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n\nThe majority of garment workers are women. In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Bangladesh, for example, at least 80% of garment workers are estimated to be female. Like everyone else in the supply chain, they’re in competition too for jobs that can be vital to their families’ survival. Out of necessity, they may suffer inadequate pay, sexual harassment, and other abuses, simply because low wages are better than no wages.\n\nCombined, these dynamics allow brands to pay less and less for their clothes. One analysis last year by Mark Anner, director of Penn State University’s Center for Global Workers’ Rights, found that brands are generally paying less (pdf) to make a pair of cotton trousers in Bangladesh for export to the US than they were before the Rana Plaza disaster. And if brands are paying less, it’s harder to pay workers more.\n\nThe collective-action dilemma\n\nDespite their pledges to better regulate their supply chains, and despite the customer outcry they face every time they get bad press, well-known multinational labels continue to have their garments turn up at factories accused of abusing workers.\n\nH&M in particular has been outspoken about its ethical and sustainability initiatives, and the need for change. Sävman says he generally concurs with the ETI’s assessment, but also believes ethical purchasing practices can be good for business. The company, he explains, is in the midst of adapting its sourcing, trying to “minimize the cons” while maintaining the model overall. In 2013, for instance, it launched a five-year pilot program that saw it partner with some of its major suppliers in Bangladesh and Cambodia. Among its goals, including some related to environmental sustainability, was getting worker pay up to a living wage, meaning one that covers their needs and those of their families, with some money left over for spending or saving.\n\nBut the company admits that while wages have increased, it still has work to do. The Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of trade unions and non-governmental organizations that advocates for workers in the garment industry, has lately harangued H&M for failing to live up to its promise. H&M’s reply has been that there’s “no silver bullet” to achieve a fair living wage for workers, and that it will take a dedicated, industry-wide effort to make it happen.\n\nThousands of Bangladeshi garment workers on the outskirts of Dhaka protested for better wages in January.\n\nDorothée Baumann-Pauly, research director at NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, which has done its own investigations into the problems of the garment industry, believes the brands have a sincere interest in establishing decent working conditions. “There are a lot of admirable CSR activities including auditing and capacity building and training, even training for improved industrial relations,” she says. Even so, it’s “business as usual,” she points out, “plus specific activities that then try to compensate for what business models are causing.”\n\nSo why hasn’t there been more change? One possibility is that brands keep trying to fix systemic problems through unilateral projects, when what appears to be needed is collective, industry-wide reform. That’s easier said than done when any move that raises prices or reduces the speed of an individual brand puts it at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe authors of the ETI report describe it as a “collective action dilemma.” It’s a situation in which everyone would be better off cooperating, but their conflicting interests prevent it. “In such situations, individual action will continually fail to address underlying problems as each actor in the chain has an incentive to focus on lower costs and drive down labour standards and wages,” the report says.\n\nKalpona Akter, an activist for workers’ rights and chief executive of the Bangladesh Centre for Workers Solidarity, takes a more skeptical of brands’ motivations, saying they were forced to make visible efforts in the wake of disasters such as Rana Plaza to save their images. “They didn’t do that voluntarily,” she told me in an interview this past November, when she was speaking at Business of Fashion’s Voices conference. “They had been pressured, and our people had to be killed to let them do whatever they’ve done in terms of improving safety.”\n\nAkter said that foreign fashion brands continue to wield a great deal of power in Bangladesh. If they really wanted to, she argues, they could use their tremendous financial leverage to pressure both factory owners and the government to bring about change.\n\nWhy governments allow it to happen\n\nIn theory, the governments in countries that are big garment exporters could step in to ensure that their citizens are paid and treated fairly, whatever demands foreign companies may make. Except that they’re in competition too, in a sense, because their economies may rely on the export industries, giving them an incentive to keep wages low in their own countries.\n\nBangladesh is an extreme case. Clothing has come to account for more than 83% of its exports over the past three decades. And many government officials themselves have investments in the garment industry.\n\n“The government of Bangladesh—and many of the countries that host the global garment industry—considers low wages to be a comparable advantage and … cheap labor to be something that is their right to kind of exploit,” explained Sarah Fox, the former special representative for international labor affairs at the US Department of State, at a summit last April on the industry’s progress since Rana Plaza.\n\nFox also pointed out that Bangladesh’s government had made it harder for workers to unionize, creating bureaucratic obstacles such as demanding that 30% of workers in a factory join a union for it to be recognized. Bodies such as the International Labour Organization and Human Rights Watch have deemed that percentage unreasonably high.\n\nA few months ago, when tens of thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers took to the streets to protest the government’s failure to raise the minimum wage to the levels they demanded, police squelched the demonstrations with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. The Worker Rights Consortium, an independent monitor of labor rights, called it the most extensive repression (pdf) it had documented in two decades of work in Bangladesh, and pointed to the government and apparel factory owners as responsible.\n\nWhile in the past, workers’ movements have been galvanized and gained popular support after industrial disasters, Bangladeshi garment workers after Rana Plaza found themselves with little leverage to exert. If governments view workers as commodities, and brands can quite easily move to other factories—or even other countries—to make their clothes, they lack the power to force changes in their working conditions.\n\nPolice in Bangladesh chase protesters who in January took to the streets to demand higher wages.\n\nIt’s not as simple as people in power exploiting those without it, though. Governments in low-wage countries also see a national benefit in attracting foreign brands with low prices. Bangladesh’s garment industry, exploitative as it may be, has been instrumental in reducing poverty and fueling the country’s startling economic growth. Researchers and unions often note that garment workers want more work, not less. They’d just like to be paid better for it.\n\nBoth the benefits and struggles workers endure in these sprawling, pressurized supply chains are direct consequences of foreign brands looking across the globe for inexpensive sources of labor. It’s free trade at work, in all its complexity, as the authors of the ETI report note: “On the one hand, the mechanisms driving competitiveness have brought jobs, unprecedented economic growth, and opportunities to places like Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and South Africa,” they write. “On the other hand, the same mechanisms also make work exploitative and precarious.”\n\nThe authors quote a senior corporate social responsibility manager on the conundrum: “Let’s be honest. It’s called capitalism!”\n\nThe path to development\n\nThere’s an argument that the low wages and exploitative conditions workers in developing nations face in industries such as the garment business are just temporary, and are actually a sort of stepping stone to a future of rising incomes and standards of living. The shining example of this process is China.\n\nThe country attracted foreign customers with its abundant labor and low costs, kept down in part through lax regulation of labor and environmental standards. It used those foreign investments and its large domestic savings (pdf) to increase its economic productivity and foster the growth of more advanced jobs, making more complex products. Wages rose, giving rise to a consumer class that has mushroomed. In 2019, the country that makes most of the world’s clothes is now poised to overtake the US as the biggest market for them, while clothing and footwear companies are looking for cheaper alternatives to make their products.\n\nCities such as Shenzhen are nothing like they were even a few decades ago.\n\nThe garment industry offers an entry point to building the manufacturing base to spur this process, since clothes are a relatively simple product to start making. So are the conditions in countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam just part of this road to economic development?\n\n“That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it?” ETI’s Buttle says. “In some ways you can look at China and say, ‘Well, actually they have managed to develop.'”\n\nBangladesh, for all the problems that still exist in its garment industry, is better off today than it was a few decades ago. But, Buttle notes, China’s economy wasn’t nearly so dependent on garments as Bangladesh is, and even if it is getting richer as a whole, that doesn’t mean garment workers are receiving their fair share of the benefits. “There’s an elite group who maybe are benefitting more than the mass of the workers,” he says.\n\nNYU’s Baumann-Pauly separately points out that the garment industries around Southeast Asia haven’t really followed China in graduating to making more complex items, such as electronics, that justify higher wages. “They’re doing the same basic garments that they did 10 years ago, most of them at least,” she says of factories in Bangladesh. “Then it’s difficult to pay higher classes and higher wages, and so they’re pretty much stuck.”\n\nBesides, even if low-wage industries can lead to development, workers need not be mistreated along the way. There’s really no good justification for the dreadful conditions that persist.\n\nTo ensure workers are properly protected, paid, and able to attain some sort of advancement through the garment industry will probably require brands and others to come up with alternative models that disrupt, in part or whole, the “cheap, flexible, and fast” regime that characterizes much of fashion’s supply chains. (The same is likely true, incidentally, if the fashion industry intends to reduce the tremendous strain it is placing on the environment.) There isn’t one clear path forward, but big stakeholders have been experimenting with different ways of doing things.\n\nFactories in Ethiopia are rising as a new sourcing destination for clothing brands.\n\nA collective-action solution\n\nThe ETI points to collective-action agreements as one option. They let brands pool resources, allowing them to accomplish together what no one brand could do on its own. They also let them use their collected leverage over suppliers to make sure they pay their workers well and maintain a safe working environment. Lastly, they spread the economic costs, making them easier to bear. Cost is always a stumbling block: “Who’s going to pay?” is the perennial question asked in any effort to improve conditions and raise wages.\n\nH&M’s Sävman and Jenny Fagerlin, the company’s sustainability manager for global production, believe this kind of industry-wide agreement offers maybe the best path to reform. One notable example is ACT, which stands for Action, Collaboration, Transformation, and has brought together brands and trade unions in an effort to raise garment wages in factories in Cambodia, Turkey, and Myanmar. By having a number of powerful companies in agreement, it reduces the price competition between them that drives down wages, theoretically making it more feasible for factories to pay wages high enough for workers to support themselves and their families. ACT also promotes workers organizing—a condition experts believe to be necessary for real change—and Fagerlin says it helps move away from a transactional relationship between brands and their suppliers.\n\nThe most prominent case of this type of agreement is the Accord, the joint effort by brands and trade unions that formed after the Rana Plaza tragedy to share the work of inspecting and fixing factories in Bangladesh’s garment industry. While arguably flawed, it has accomplished much of the work it set out to do in the factories it targeted, though factory owners and Bangladesh’s government are currently trying to push it out.\n\nAnother promising approach is to have brands treat the factories that make their clothes as long-term partners, rather than temporary contractors. “In its most advanced form, such a partnership creates supply chain interdependency,” the ETI report says. “Supply chain interdependency overcomes the problem of being non-committal to suppliers, shifting of commercial risk to supplier, a ‘hit & run’ approach and flexibility of changing suppliers ‘like your shirt.'”\n\nBaumann-Pauly is currently studying a company that is sourcing from Ethiopia, which is rising rapidly as a low-cost destination (paywall) for making clothes. It made a five-year commitment to work with its suppliers and help them improve their productivity. At this stage she can’t name the company, but she explains, “They know that in the first couple of years they will not make money from those suppliers, but they want to get them there. And so it’s an entirely different business model, saying, ‘We’re in a partnership. We accept losses at the beginning of this partnership. But we think we can do this together, raise productivity, and then get us to a point where we both make money.'”\n\nOther options for changing the system include looking to governments to intervene, or relying on the demands from ethical consumers who resolve to withhold their dollars from brands that don’t reform. But Buttle points out that neither is a realistic path to change. “If you’re provided with a cheap garment, most people are just going to buy it without thinking about it,” he says. “There are, I think, more consumers who are asking these questions, and more conscious of these kinds of issues. But at the same time, we shouldn’t put too much of the emphasis on the consumer to do the work for the brands.”\n\nShoppers fill a Uniqlo store in Paris, France.\n\nThe global garment trade may yet see a major upheaval in the decades ahead, not coming from labor movements but because of automation. Fashion has been slow developing robots that can handle stitching stretchy, pliable fabrics, in part because it has had an endless pool of cheap labor to draw on, but it may only be a matter of time. The International Labour Organization has warned that workers in the apparel and footwear industries, particularly in Southeast Asia, are at risk of being displaced in the millions, and that governments should begin investing in preparing workers for higher value manufacturing\n\nThe good news, both Buttle and Baumann-Pauly say, is that brands are really beginning to question how they do business at a fundamental level. The hope is a new approach will emerge and take hold that really does improve the lives of the millions of garment workers cutting and sewing the clothes, shoes, and other items that people in rich countries such as the US buy, wear, and discard so casually.\n\nThe big aspiration for the new and growing garment industry in Ethiopia, for instance, is that it can avoid the problems that have plagued the industry in countries such as Bangladesh. The Hawassa Industrial Park, inaugurated in 2016 as the largest industrial park in Africa, has new buildings and a modern sewage system. The government there sees it as a key component in its plan to transform Ethiopia into a manufacturing economy, and even though pay was low when it opened, workers were optimistic about the opportunities it might offer. PVH Corp., owner of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, is one of the companies that is producing its clothes there, and has been honored by the US State Department for its responsible conduct in Ethiopia.\n\nBut already the story is starting to sound familiar: Complaints have surfaced that the pay in Ethiopia’s nascent garment industry isn’t enough to live on. A recent survey suggests the great majority of workers don’t earn a living wage. In March, workers went on strike to protest the inadequate pay and poor conditions. As new reports of labor abuses have cropped up, PVH Corp. has vowed to investigate.",

Topics range from the innocuous, such as whether to list being fluent in Klingon—a language in the Star Trek universe—on a resume, to more difficult questions such as whether to let a colleague know that he or she is about to be laid off.\n\nAt least twice in recent years, Green also has used her blog to take on one of the most sensitive subjects in the workplace: compensation. And this week, she’s done it again.\n\nOn April 24, Green uploaded a salary survey on her blog to provide more clarity around how much people get paid. More than 12,000 respondents have answered the survey to date.\n\nIn addition to annual salary figures, the survey asks people to identify their age, industry, job title, location, post-college job experience, and the currency in which they are paid. It also provides a field for additional context. The information lives on an anonymous Google spreadsheet that can be publicly viewed.\n\nAs Green notes in her latest post about the topic of compensation, salary websites are often inaccurate, and “people can get weird when you ask them questions directly.” Even when salaries are available, it can be difficult to find a more granular breakdown by industry, geography, or experience level.\n\nA single, sortable spreadsheet does away with the frills and hurdles you get with sites like Glassdoor and PayScale, which often require you to join before you can get access to information, and lets the numbers speak for themselves.\n\nAsk A Manager’s salary spreadsheet is the latest example of “Google-doc activism” where sensitive information is shared via anonymous spreadsheets. The idea first became popular after engineer Erica Baker, while working at Google, created and shared a spreadsheet that showed pay inequities at the tech giant. News of the spreadsheet went viral in 2015. Since then, similar spreadsheets and surveys have been used to provide insight on sensitive topics from the gender breakdown of engineers at tech companies to the alleged mistreatment of women at companies such as Nike.\n\nGreen’s spreadsheet offers some interesting tidbits about jobs and pay. In St. Louis, Missouri, there’s a “zoo curator” who makes $70,000 annually. In Portland, Oregon, there’s a respondent with 8 to 10 years of experience who earns $68,000 a year importing coffee, and an elementary-school teacher with 21 to 30 years of experience who takes home just $30,000.\n\nThe survey suggests that well-paying jobs can be found outside tech or finance or the biggest cities. A consumer safety officer (who inspects government-regulated industries) in Long Beach, California, a grocery store HR director in Spokane, Washington, and a marketing manager in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, all make more than $96,000 a year.\n\nYou can watch the data come in live, and it's fascinating. (We're already at 1400+ responses in 30 minutes so far.) https://t.co/qr5UGvT1k7\n\n— Ask a Manager (@AskAManager) April 24, 2019\n\nBut the information does not necessarily provide a complete picture. It is self-selecting survey, after all, and it has its share of misspellings, typos, and responses that don’t actually answer the question. Notably, the survey does not include race or gender, which can provide more nuanced insight into salaries.\n",

          "description": "Plant-based meat products might fix our food system.\n \nBeyond Meat, the plant-based meat company, is going public next week.\n\nThe company sells burgers that contain no meat, but taste like they do. Its stated goal is to fix our food system. Its initial public offering (IPO) is the latest sign that alt-meat is going mainstream — and that’s a big deal.\n\nIt’s been a good few years for Beyond Meat. National chains including Del Taco, Carl’s Jr., and T.G.I. Friday’s have started carrying their products. They’ve also found their way onto grocery store shelves at Whole Foods, Kroger, and Target. In total, Beyond Meat says its products are available in more than 35,000 outlets, from hotels and college campuses to grocery stores and sports stadiums. Sales have been growing fast — last year the company reported revenues of $87.9 million, up from $32.6 million in 2017.\n\nNow, the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO, scheduled for next week. They’ll sell shares in the company for between $19 and $21 per share, allowing them to raise $183 million for additional manufacturing facilities, research and development, and sales. If their stock sells at the high end of that, the company would be valued at $1.2 billion. They’ll be listed on NASDAQ as BYND.\n\nFounded in 2009 by CEO Ethan Brown, the Los Angeles-based company’s products first hit supermarket shelves in 2013. Its rapid rise — food is not an easy industry to break into — reflects intense consumer demand and investor interest in meat alternatives. The company has never been profitable, and lost $29 million in 2018, but its rapidly growing revenues made it a good bet to many investors — as did its positioning on the frontier of a transformation of our food system.\n\n“Beyond Meat was the first company to really set its sights on creating meat from plants that could compete on the basis of the things that meat eaters like about meat,” Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, which works on policy and investment surrounding meat alternatives, told me. “Before Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, there was really this sense that plant-based foods was for vegetarians. People like Ethan Brown said, ‘No, we can make plant-based foods that meat eaters like just as much.’” \n\nBrown will soon have a billion-dollar company to prove it. And while it’s the first plant-based meat company to go public, it looks likely that it won’t be the last. The trend that brought Beyond Meat racing to its billion-dollar valuation and IPO are just getting started — and that has the potential to be game-changing, not just for the industry, but for the world.\n\nPlant-based meat alternatives are getting big\n\nThere’s a lot wrong with our food system. Producing meat by raising animals on factory farms produces tons of greenhouse gases, and many analysts think we can’t tackle climate change without tackling the enormous emissions that go into agriculture. Animals in close quarters are fed low-dose antibiotics constantly so they don’t make one another sick, which contributes to antibiotic resistance, a huge threat on the horizon for public health. And animals on factory farms are routinely subjected to intense cruelty and conditions that disgust the average American consumer.\n\nThat’s what inspired people to start working on meat alternatives — and it may be what’s inspiring the consumer enthusiasm that has buoyed them in recent years. Products like veggie burgers, fake chicken, and soy and almond milk are growing in popularity and market share — and even better, they’re getting tastier and harder to distinguish from animal products. \n\nNew breakthroughs in food science have made it easier to imitate the flavor and texture of real meat. While early veggie burgers were almost exclusively purchased by vegetarians, Brown says that 93 percent of Beyond Meat customers buy regular meat too — suggesting the company has succeeded at making something that appeals to meat eaters. \n\nBeyond Meat was among the pioneers of this new generation of plant-based meat, which aimed to replace bean-based veggie burgers marketed mostly to vegans. Now, they’ll be the first plant-based meat company to have an IPO. It’s a remarkable success for the company. It’s also remarkable because food companies rarely go public, Friedrich told me: “The food industry is highly centralized, and most exits are mergers or acquisitions by large food conglomerates.” \n\nLast year, there were rumors that industry giant (and Beyond Meat investor) Tyson Foods was considering buying the company. Beyond Meat stayed independent, though. A few months later, the company added the chief financial officers of Coca-Cola and of Twitter to their board, signaling that it was getting the expertise on-board that it needed to become a huge public company.\n\nThe rest of the plant-based meat industry has been thriving too. Qdoba announced last week that it would be serving Beyond Meat competitor Impossible Foods. Earlier in April, Burger King launched the Impossible Whopper. Industry giants Tyson and Purdue are pursuing their own plant-based product lines. A few years ago, the Impossible Burger was available in a handful of restaurants — now it can be found in more than 5,000.\n\n“There’s a sense that there’s a movement going on that’s much bigger than any one company,” Brown told Vox two weeks ago. \n\nThe interesting thing about that movement is that plant-based meats don’t have to displace all animal meats in order to make a big difference. Every burger replaced with a Beyond Burger has an impact on CO2 emissions, demand for factory farming, and demand for antibiotics. The more the plant-based meat industry grows, the more those impacts will be visible — and that might, in turn, itself fuel more interest in plant-based meats. Beyond Burger’s team doesn’t just believe they’ve found a niche — they say they’ve figured out the “Future of Protein.” Here’s hoping they’re right.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

          "description": "You can cook chicken thighs a million and one ways, but there’s one method I turn to over and over: a cast-iron skillet and surprisingly low heat. I first learned this Genius technique from my co-worker Kristen Miglore, who learned it from Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer.\n\nBasically, you salt-and-pepper the thighs, place them in a pan over medium heat, and leave them alone. Fast-forward 15 to 30 minutes later and the skin is as crispy as a potato chip. Flip, cook a little longer, and you’ve got the best chicken thighs of your life.\n\nThe obvious follow-up question is: What do you serve them with? But the better question is: What do you do with all that rendered chicken fat?\n\nI’m supposed to tell you to put it in a jar and keep it in the fridge for future sautéed vegetables. But any time I do this myself, I forget about said jar, and end up asking my husband three weeks later, “What is this?” (I don’t know.) “Can I throw it out?” (Uh, sure.) And into the trash it goes.\n\nUsing the chicken fat immediately not only avoids this unfortunate fate, but ties the whole dish together. Such was the idea behind this weeknight favorite of mine:\n\nInstead of using olive oil to pan-fry the croutons and sautée the kale: chicken fat to the rescue! I love how that rich flavor connects the components—and, you know, the fact that you get to reuse the same pan is pretty cool, too.\n\nThis recipe is just like that, but make it spring. Instead of wintry kale, we have plucky asparagus. And instead of torn bread, there are tiny potatoes. Bacon joins the party because bacon is delicious.\n\nBacon also gives us another flavorful fat to play around with. Think of it like a rendered fat relay (what, like your high school didn’t have those?). Cook the chicken thighs, then smash-fry the potatoes in that chicken fat. Cook the bacon, then sauté the asparagus in that bacon fat. (Psst: Blanching both the potatoes and asparagus beforehand not only gives them a head start, but seasons them throughout with salt.)\n\nIf this all sounds very rich, it’s not—thanks to garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard. These assertive players keep the whole dish feeling bright and sprightly, just like I want all my spring dinners to be.\n\nCrispy Chicken Thighs With Asparagus, Bacon & Potatoes\n\nView Recipe\n\nIngredients\n\n6\n\ntablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste\n\n1\n\ntablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n4\n\nchicken thighs\n\n1\n\npinch freshly ground black pepper\n\n1\n\npound golf ball–sized red potatoes\n\n1\n\npound asparagus, fibrous ends trimmed\n\n4\n\nthick slices bacon, roughly chopped into ¾-inch pieces\n\n2\n\ngarlic cloves, minced\n\n1\n\npinch red pepper flakes\n\n1\n\nlemon, juiced\n\n2\n\nteaspoons Dijon mustard\n\n6\n\ntablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste\n\n1\n\ntablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n4\n\nchicken thighs\n\n1\n\npinch freshly ground black pepper\n\n1\n\npound golf ball–sized red potatoes\n\n1\n\npound asparagus, fibrous ends trimmed\n\n4\n\nthick slices bacon, roughly chopped into ¾-inch pieces\n\n2\n\ngarlic cloves, minced\n\n1\n\npinch red pepper flakes\n\n1\n\nlemon, juiced\n\n2\n\nteaspoons Dijon mustard\n\nMore Chicken Thighs, Please\n\nWhat's your favorite way to cook chicken thighs?

          "description": "Welcome to 30 Days, 30 Ways to Green, where we're sharing all the little (and not so little!) things we do to live eco-friendlier every day. Stick with us all month long for a lineup of handy tips—from composting do's and don'ts to which reusable products really light up our lives.\n\nWhen we set out to create 30 days' worth of tips, stories, and guides for how we’re all trying to live eco-friendlier every day, there was one topic our whole team couldn't stop Slacking about: $0 ways to go green.\n\nAs in, all the small but mighty ways we incorporate sustainable practices into our lives, without spending a single cent. Like ditching plastic bags at the grocery store, or using every last citrus peel. Some of us time our showers; others reuse jars as lunch containers each day.\n \nFrom the kitchen to the farmers' market, here are the highly doable, no-cost ways we're living eco-friendlier today. (And we're dying to know: What top tips do you swear by?)\n\n1. Cut down on packaging. \n\nCarry reusable totes in your backpack or purse, for transporting groceries (or anything else you need to ferry around!).\n \nThink before you bag grocery store produce in plastic—items like onions, shallots, bananas, and garlic don’t need the extra layer.\n \nBring lunch as much as you can—not only does it give you an excuse to repurpose scraps and leftovers, but it'll let you skip all the packaging that comes with buying lunch. (\"The delivery bags, plastic utensils, and endless containers make me cringe,\" says Associate Buyer, Aja Aktay.)\n \nDon't leave the house without a reusable water bottle, to fill up wherever you are.\n\n2. Reuse any packaging you can't avoid.\n\n\"Whenever I get a package with bubble wrap, I fold it up and save it for when I need to pack something,\" says Amanda Hesser, co-founder and CEO. \"Also, any time I get a gift, I save the ribbon, and if possible, the paper, too.\"\n \nSave the containers from any larder or pantry items that come in jars—like, yogurt, kimchi, pasta sauce—and use them as food storage containers, flower vases, and drinking glasses.\n \nThe brown butcher paper that often comes as package filler makes for excellent gift wrap. Just add upcycled twine or string for a bow!\n \n\"I add empty food boxes and egg cartons to my son's play kitchen, or use for an art project,\" says Sarah Yaffa, data analyst.\n\n3. Give things away, instead of throwing them out.\n\nLook for local spots (like Goodwill) that accept donations for clothing and furniture, so you can skip the trash bin.\n \nOn the flip side, take advantage of message boards like Craigslist \"free stuff\" in your neighborhood if you're on the lookout for something like a couch or a computer monitor.\n\n4. Save all those scraps.\n\nHang onto those vegetable scraps! And that feta brine. Oh, and those banana peels. There's a secondary use for pretty much any edible ingredient you might think to toss. (\"We use citrus peels to make our own all-purpose cleaning spray a little scented,\" says Business Operations Director and Executive Assistant, Karen Levi.)\n \n Start a compost bin for any food scraps that don't make it into a recipe.\n \nLook beyond food scraps to repurpose absolutely everything you can around the house. \"My mom always had a 'rag bag'—all old t-shirts, sheets, and towels went in there, and were used for cleaning,\" says Amanda.\n\n5. Be thoughtful when it comes to energy.\n\n\"Living eco-friendlier is about an awareness that just about everything we do requires energy,\" says Dave Katz, video editor. \"Take shorter showers, remember to turn lights off if nobody's in a room, don't let the sink run for no reason, and close the fridge.\"\n \nBuild a quick check into your routine to make sure your air conditioner or heater's off when you're heading out.\n \nIf feasible, opt to walk or take public transportation rather than adding a vehicle to the road. \"When the weather is nice (which, thankfully, is happening more and more often) and I don't have to travel too far, I always try to walk or take public transportation rather than hopping in a taxi,\" says Assistant Editor of Partner Content, Erin Alexander.\n\n What are your top $0 tips for living more sustainably? Let us know in the comments! \n",

          "description": "It’s not uncommon to feel as if you’ve seen every rendition of kale salad that exists. I’d certainly felt similarly for years—until recently, when I had the kale salad at Haven’s Kitchen, an all-day cafe/event space/cooking school/all around food lover’s paradise.\n \nThis isn’t just another kale salad recipe. It changed my mind about kale salad. What makes it stand out is the clever technique that instantly transforms it into something extraordinary...or should I say eggstraordinary? (Because all you need are a couple eggs.)\n\n“I freaked. Honestly! It’s so simple,” said Ali Cayne, owner of Haven's Kitchen, when she first learned of the clever method. “I'd never done it or heard of it, and it was mind-blowing.”\n \nBefore you make any assumptions, know that this isn’t your typical put-a-fried-egg-on-top move. In this case, the lightly crisped, runny yolked eggs don’t go on the salad. They go in the salad.\n\n This isn’t just another kale salad recipe. It changed my *mind* about kale salad. \n\nOnce the chopped greens are dressed and the salad is tossed with pretty much anything you like, a couple fried eggs go right on top. A second vigorous mix with a pair of tongs, allows the yolks to mix with the vinaigrette creating a rich, vicious dressing similar to a Caesar, only way easier.\n\n“The egg yolks help bind the salad together,” explained Haven's Kitchen Chef Adi Fracchia, who’d relied on this pro-tip at home while craving a “yummy and satisfying but secretly healthy” dinner, but only had a few minutes to cook.\n \nIn addition to being the magical ingredient in the creamy dressing, the warmth of the eggs wilt the kale slightly, tenderizing it without having to do a pre-dressing oil massage that many recipes suggest, not to mentioned they speckle the salad with little bits of salty fried eggs.\n \nThe salad was such a hit with the Haven’s Kitchen staff that it occasionally appears on the seasonally rotating menu in the super-chic cafe. But the salad hasn’t just won the hearts of the HK crew and bustling cafe goers, it’s also a favorite of Cayne’s children.\n \n“They love eggs and the adventure of a fun dish that they get to hunt for stuff in. So finding the bits of fried egg white and cheese is fun for them,” says the mother of five. “They also love breadcrumbs when I have the bandwidth to make them.”\n \nYou can make Chef Adi’s version with quick-pickled onions and garlicky thyme-flecked breadcrumbs or try the technique with a version of your own. And since the salad is so versatile, you can make it as simple or as sophisticated as you like.\n \n“Sometimes I just toss with olive oil, Parm, lemon zest, and Maldon,\" added Cayne. \"The yolk does the rest.”\n\n Haven's Kitchen Kale Salad \n View Recipe \n\nIngredients\n\n1\n \n small (or 1/2 large) red onion, thinly sliced \n\n3/4\n \n cup rice wine vinegar, divided \n\n Kosher salt \n\n1/4\n \n cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking \n\n1\n \n teaspoon honey \n\n1/2\n \n teaspoon Aleppo pepper \n\n1/4\n \n teaspoon freshly ground black pepper \n\n1\n \n cup panko breadcrumbs \n\n3\n \n garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated \n\n1\n \n sprig fresh thyme, leaves removed (optional) \n\n1\n \n large bunch curly or lacinato kale, washed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups total) \n\n3\n \n large eggs \n\n4\n \n ounces feta cheese (about 1/2 cup) \n\n1\n \n small (or 1/2 large) red onion, thinly sliced \n\n3/4\n \n cup rice wine vinegar, divided \n\n Kosher salt \n\n1/4\n \n cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking \n\n1\n \n teaspoon honey \n\n1/2\n \n teaspoon Aleppo pepper \n\n1/4\n \n teaspoon freshly ground black pepper \n\n1\n \n cup panko breadcrumbs \n\n3\n \n garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated \n\n1\n \n sprig fresh thyme, leaves removed (optional) \n\n1\n \n large bunch curly or lacinato kale, washed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups total) \n\n3\n \n large eggs \n\n4\n \n ounces feta cheese (about 1/2 cup) \n\n How do you make your kale salad?

          "description": "We’re all California dreamin’ once in a while, so when the Golden State calls you for a visit, bring along this handy list of hot spots for a family road trip with kids stretching from San Diego to Santa Barbara.\n\nOne caveat: There is so much to do in Southern California, that it can be overwhelming. Take it from a local — don’t make yourself crazy trying to hit everything in one trip. Plan for at least five nights so your family can properly enjoy the sights and avoid being stuck in the car the whole time.\n\nThe view at sunrise from Santa Barbara’s East Beach.\n\nSan Diego\n\nStart with flying into the super easy San Diego International Airport (SAN) and hop the shuttle to its brand-new rental car facility. Once settled into your vehicle, you and your family will be ready to roll on over to some of the great experiences San Diego has to offer.\n\nWarm Sands: Visit La Jolla Shores Beach for warm sand, clean beaches and family-friendly waters. You can bring a picnic lunch and spread out on the grass, or walk into the nearby village for sandwiches or tacos. Up the road a bit is the stunning Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the UCSD Birch Aquarium. (Entrance to the aquarium is $19.50 for adults, $15 for kids 3–17 and free for kids 2 and under.)\n\nWild Animals: San Diego is famous for the zoo, and it is really an amazing place. However, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park is a less-crowded and very interesting alternative when you have a car. (A one-day pass is $56 for adults and $36 for kids 3–11.) The safari park is about 32 miles from downtown San Diego, and well worth the drive to see wild animals in their natural habitats. Giraffes, gazelle, rhinos and more all graze on open acres of hilly grasslands. For an extra fee, consider the Caravan Safari package that allows families an even closer view of the animals. ($125 per person plus park admission; participants must be 6 or older.)\n\nGet up close and personal with the animals at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.\n\nLegos for Days: If your kids are younger, Legoland California is an all-time favorite. Exhibits and characters made completely of Lego bricks dot the park landscape. Rides and shows are geared to an audience 12 and under, but parents and older siblings will have a pretty great time here too. For an amusement park, the food is pretty darn good and there is plenty to keep you busy for the whole day. Legoland is in Carlsbad, about a 40-minute drive from downtown San Diego. (Admission is $90 for kids and $95 for adults if bought in advance online.)\n\nRelated: The Best Credit Cards for Entertainment Spending\n\nAnaheim\n\nJust over an hour up the coast from San Diego, Anaheim is home to the Disneyland and Disney California Adventure parks, among other attractions. It would be hard to drive past the Matterhorn and Space Mountain without stopping for a visit, so by all means stop and stay a spell.\n\nAlways a favorite — everyone loves the Mad Tea Party ride at Disneyland (except Dad — ugh).\n\nSo Much Disney: Anaheim would be a sleepy orange grove without the dreams of Walt Disney, and his Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park are a magical legacy. The parks, just down the road from Disney studios, are a little more quaint and OG than Florida’s Disney World. Buy the two-day Park Hopper Pass as you simply cannot do it all in one day, though three days might be too many unless this is your only destination. Admission to Disneyland parks varies. (Here’s where to stay at Disneyland.)\n\nKnott’s Berry Farm: Amusement park junkies should consider including a quick visit to Knott’s Berry Farm. Just 10 minutes from Disneyland in Buena Park, Knott’s is one of our kids’ favorites for straight-up thrill rides. Without all the Disney hoopla, this park does a great job with crowd management and plenty of entertainment (and some stomach-dropping rides that had us all in laughing fits). Plus, they have darn good berry pie a la mode — it is the same family that started the jam empire. (Daily admission for ages 3 and up starts at $49 per person.)\n\nRides for both daredevils and littles are easy to access at Knott’s Berry Farm.\n\nTrendy Food Hall: When you grow weary of amusement park food, drive 10 minutes to the Anaheim Packing District for decent grub. A converted orange-packing warehouse, this collective is a group of interesting food vendors spread across two large floors. We love this place because the food is fresh, healthy and diverse, so we can all get different things and still sit together in the center court.\n\nLots of great food choices at Anaheim Packing District.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nBroadly known as “LA,” the Los Angeles area is vast. It’s comprised of many cities and neighborhoods that run together in a jumble. A car and much patience is necessary for getting around this area, and a good mapping app on your smartphone will help you gauge traffic flow. (Don’t make these mistakes that travelers make in Los Angeles.)\n\nThe rides on Santa Monica Pier\n\nCarnival Over Water: The Santa Monica Pier and surrounding beach, often used for TV and movie scenes, are a must-see. On the sand near the pier, locals and visitors can show off their skills bouncing on a springy tightrope, rolling across the sand in giant inflatable “hamster balls” and swinging on giant monkey bars. On the pier, enjoy the rides at Pacific Park throughout the day and into the night. Restaurants and shops help entertain those who might be less ride-inclined. You can buy a wristband that entitles you to unlimited rides all day for $32 (ages 8 and older) and $17 for kids 7 and under. Otherwise, pay per ride. Admission to the park itself is free.\n\nGlass Slide Above Downtown: Not for the faint of heart, OUE Skyspace is part Hollywood museum/part observatory/part thrill ride as it perches 70 stories above Downtown LA. The views from here are exceptional, with outdoor balconies sporting nearly 360-degree views of the Hollywood sign, Santa Catalina Island, the sometimes-snowcapped San Gabriel Mountains and more. But that slide! Curving around the outside of the building, the slide is completely made of high-strength glass. Sliding down that tunnel means stomach-dropping views through the floor to the streets more than 1,000 feet below ($25 for adults and $19 for kids 3–12, plus $8 per person for the slide).\n\nIt’s unnerving to slide on glass 1,000 feet in the sky.\n\nPlanets Day or Night: At the famous Griffith Observatory, our solar system and galaxy are on display in various entertaining and scientific ways. Exhibits feature discoveries about the planets, space and our views of them throughout human history. The huge telescope was not in operation when we visited, but good timing might allow guests a peep into the stars. Along with an excellent planetarium ($7 for adults, $3 for kids 5–12 and free for those under 5) and various shows throughout the day, this is a different kind of star-struck Hollywood experience. (BTW, the Hollywood sign is directly adjacent and looks enormous up close.) Note that the observatory is closed April 22–May 6, 2019.\n\nThe first telescope Griffith J. Griffith used to view the stars, on display at Griffith Observatory\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nOne of our favorite cities in California, Santa Barbara, is about two hours up the coast from LA. The view as you hit Ventura and drive up along the beaches and oceanfront is one of the most beautiful highway vistas on the West Coast and well worth the drive. (You could plan to fly out of Santa Barbara Airport (SBA) or choose to drive back to Los Angeles and depart from LAX.)\n\nThe Queen of Missions: Built in 1786, the Santa Barbara Mission is the 10th of 21 constructed as part of Father Junipero Serra’s sojourn from Mexico to Northern California. Every California fourth grader learns about the missions of California, which means our kids could recite interesting facts about how adobe bricks are made and the fine art of basket weaving. This stunning mission is so well preserved that guests can really get an authentic feel for mission life in early California. Time your spring visit to coincide with Santa Barbara’s I Madonnari Italian street painting festival, when renowned artists paint masterpieces on the pavement outside the mission steps.\n\nVisiting the Santa Barbara Mission on the right day, we enjoyed the chalk painting festival.\n\nBicycle Built for Two (or Four or Six): On the waterfront near Stearns Wharf, a variety of two- and four-wheeled cycles are available for rent by the hour (prices vary). The ride along the paved boardwalk is one of the most beautiful in California, with wide beaches, waving palms and gorgeous ocean views. For families with younger kids, the four-wheel buggies might be the best bet. On our last visit, we left our kids asleep in the hotel room and rented bikes for an early morning view of the local fishing boats heading out for the day’s catch.\n\nA ride along the Santa Barbara beach boardwalk is a great way to enjoy this city.\n\nFood and Photos: Near the wharf, a once-blighted warehouse district has been reclaimed as the Funk Zone. Wine-tasting rooms, trendy restaurants and fun art exhibits have given this area a lot of character. We explored the Funk Zone by taking a great food tour called “Eat This, Shoot That!,” an combination of a walking eat-a-thon and food photo class. Our tour guide instructed us on how to take great pictures of food with our smartphones while we tasted and sipped our way through the streets. (The tour costs $99 for adults and $89 for non-drinkers and kids 6–21.)\n\nOn the Eat This, Shoot That! walking food tour, we sample great dishes.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nWe’ve done this drive a few times now, discovering new things to do each time we visit. Along the way, we’ve stayed at some great hotels. If you’re planning your own Southern California road trip with kids, you may want to choose one hotel group for the entire vacation to consolidate using elite status or earning points via various promotions. We chose Hilton, largely because of its extensive Hilton Honors program that allowed our family to cash in points for some stays while amassing new points at other properties.\n\nEvery view is fantastic from the Hilton San Diego Bayfront.\n\nSan Diego\n\nHilton San Diego Bayfront: Downtown on the waterfront, this high-rise hotel is centrally located with all the conveniences. Award rates from 31k–60k points per night.\n\nHilton La Jolla Torrey Pines: Overlooking the famous Torrey Pines Golf Course and ocean beyond, this hotel is near beaches and a fun hang glider port. Award rates from 43k–50k points per night.\n\nAnaheim\n\nHilton Anaheim: Across the street from Disneyland, the Hilton Anaheim is in the midst of it all and slightly removed from the bustle of Disneymania. (Here’s some information if you’re debating staying on-site at Disneyland or at an off-site property.) Award rates from 33k–50k points per night.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nHilton Los Angeles/Universal City: Literally walking distance to Universal Studios and Universal Citywalk, this large hotel also is very close to Hollywood. Award rates from 50k–60k points per night.\n\nThe Beverly Hilton: Steeped in Hollywood history, the Beverly Hilton is an original grand dame and host to the Golden Globe Awards each year. Award rates from 60k points per night.\n\nThe Beverly Hilton Hotel has been host to many celebrities over the years.\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nHilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort: This hotel is right across from the city’s main beach and is a short walk to the wharf, Funk Zone and more. From 59k–80k Hilton award points per night.\n\nThe view from our room at Santa Barbara Hilton.\n\nIf you’d like to stay at Hilton properties on your Southern California road trip too, there are some good welcome bonuses available for its cobranded credit cards.\n\nCredit Card\n\n Welcome Bonus\n\nTPG Bonus Valuation\n\nAnnual Fee\n\n   Elite Status\n\nHilton Honors American Express Aspire Card\n\n150,000-point bonus after you spend $4,000 in the first three months.

          "description": "Rising return rates are terrible for the environment, and for workers. But that’s not why brands are making it more difficult.\n \nCustomers of the online fast-fashion brand Asos were informed last week that the site would be changing its notoriously lax return policy. “We need to make sure our free returns remain sustainable for us and for the environment,” the email read, “so if we notice an unusual pattern, we might investigate and take action.”\n\nIt’s a company that has long made returning items far more convenient than others — every shipment includes a free return label, the bags are easy to repackage, and refunds are quickly made in full. That’s part of the reason why Asos is one of the most successful and fastest-growing brands in fashion: Because clothes are extremely cheap and sizing and quality vary widely, buying multiple items with the assumption that some or most of it will be returned is a typical strategy for customers. \n\nBut the move was a crackdown on such serial returners, and it’s just one example of a shift among businesses to make returning the stuff you buy — but don’t want — a little harder. \n\nReturns are a growing environmental and labor issue\n\nIt’s actually a good thing that the return backlash has arrived. Returns, particularly those made online, are terrible for the environment: They typically require transport by medium- and heavy-duty trucks, vehicles that make up nearly a quarter of the carbon footprint caused by transportation, which in 2016 overtook power plants as the biggest producer of carbon dioxide emissions. \n\nReturned items often don’t even get restocked — instead, many end up in landfills. As Mashable notes, returns and excess inventory cost the environment 4 billion pounds of landfill waste every year. \n\nThese effects are exacerbated by the fact that people are buying and returning items online more than ever. During the 2015 holiday season, customers returned $69 billion worth of goods; over the 2018 holiday season, that number had jumped to $94 billion. And since return rates are higher on online purchases versus those made in stores, that number will doubtlessly continue to grow as more people shop online. \n\nThe negative effects of returns aren’t limited to the environment: More returns means more stress on the employees who then must process them. CNBC reported that returns contributed to a huge boom in the warehouse industry since 2012, so much so that “reverse logistics” — corporate jargon for “dealing with returns” — is the top new user of warehouse space in the US, accounting for 700 million square feet nationally. \n\nKerem Yucel / AFP\n\nDemonstrators held a protest at the Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota on December 14, 2018 to demand better working conditions.\n\nThis puts an extra strain on people employed in those warehouses, where working conditions are already reportedly grueling. One Amazon worker spoke to Vox’s Chavie Lieber about their experience with brutal hours, dystopian surveillance systems, and inhumane policies. Meanwhile, attempts to unionize at Amazon have been consistently thwarted by the company, which was recently valued at more than a trillion dollars. \n\nWhile the human cost is far greater, of course, returns are also bad for business: Aside from lost profit, they also increase labor costs for companies, and according to Appriss, a retail tracking database, they cause markdowns and out-of-stocks to increase. \n\nWhy companies are making returns more difficult\n\nIt’s that last bit that provides the most insight into why so many companies are discouraging customers from returning items. Revenue loss, combined with fears about return fraud, which is estimated to cost the US retail industry about $18.4 billion per year, is what Asos is targeting with its new policy. \n\nThe London-based e-tailer, which carries more than 850 brands, states in its new rules that the changes will only affect a shopper if they are “actually wearing their purchases and then returning them or ordering and returning loads — way, waaay more than even the most loyal ASOS customer would order.” If they do, it explains, it might deactivate that customer’s account.\n\nBut for many Asos shoppers, the ability to buy and then return the mostly cheap, often confusingly sized items is the main draw. The BBC spoke to some of these serial returners last year, who tend to return most of what they buy online, whether they get a high from it or because of the nature of online shopping. “You see models wearing things and it looks fantastic on them,” one said, laughing, and added that they don’t look the same on her. \n\nWhen you buy an ASOS jumpsuit thinking you'll look like this, but you end up looking like this. pic.twitter.com/wZDOxvCeQi\n— Christina McDermott-McGarrigle (@ChristinaMcMc) June 8, 2016\n\nNaturally, Asos customers were quick to complain. “Maybe if ur clothes actually arrived fitting like they’re supposed to I wouldn’t return so much god damn crap,” one woman wrote on Twitter. “Did anyone else feel more than a little threatened by the recent email from @ASOS regarding returns?” asked another. “Especially as a fat person, they’re practically my only clothes retailer option and I STILL have to order and return multiple items!”\n\nDespite the brand’s assurances that it would only affect the most extreme returners, many on Twitter have claimed within the past few days that they’ve been banned for sending back just a couple items. \n\nThis isn’t the only tactic used by clothing brands to curb the volume of returns. Everlane employs a “restocking fee” of $6 when customers make online returns to cover the cost of shipping and restocking, while Anthropologie also charges a flat $5.95 for shipping on online returns. \n\nBecause newer and smaller businesses don’t always have the resources of bigger ones, they’re disproportionally affected by rising return rates — yet lots of companies do this: Verizon, for instance. The online thrift store ThredUp, which charges a $1.99 fee with every return, explains that a return must go through the same process of inspection and quality assurance as when it arrived for it to be relisted on the site, which costs the company more money. \n\nSephora also made headlines last year when the Wall Street Journal discovered that the makeup behemoth was giving stores the ability to ban certain customers from returning items, confirming years of suspicions on beauty message boards. It, along with more than 34,000 other stores from Best Buy to Home Depot, had been using a service called the Retail Equation, which tracks customers’ returning habits via their driver’s licenses. \n\nEven L.L. Bean, the Maine-based outdoor gear brand generally considered to be on the greener and more sustainable end of the spectrum, changed its famous no-receipt needed lifetime return policy, not to save the polar bears but to save itself from being scammed. \n\nWhile making returns more difficult for customers may actually do a bit of good for warehouse workers and the environment, it’s important to note that that’s likely not the reason these companies don’t want you to return their stuff. It’s because returns add an entirely new, expensive layer to the online shopping process, and it’s bad for bottom lines. \n\nHugely popular online retailers like Amazon, meanwhile, probably aren’t going to change their generous return policies and lightning-fast shipping any time soon. For a trillion-dollar company, the priority is always going to be on keeping you — at the expense of its employees and the earth — happy. \n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?

          "description": "In his excellent market history book, It Was a Very Good Year, Martin Fridson tells the story of the year that was in the market in 1915.\n\nIt remains one of the strongest years on record for the stock market, which was up more than 50%, even though World War I was well underway at the time.\n\nFridson discusses how differently stocks were viewed in the early 20th century than they are now:\n\nJournalists commonly equated the established dividend payout with the return on the stock, giving little thought to possible appreciation. They compared the payout rate directly with bond yields; total return’s day hadn’t yet arrived. The prevailing orthodoxy held that dividend yields had to exceed prevailing interest rates on bonds to compensate for the greater uncertainty of payment. Not until several decades after the Big Board stopped quoting stocks like bonds would this mindset change.\n\nThe big changeover came in the 1950s when the dividend yield on the stock market finally dipped under the yield on government bonds. Until the 1950s, when bonds yielded more than stocks it was a clear signal that it was time to get out of the stock market.\n\nThat relationship broke down and I think one of the reasons it happened is because investors became more comfortable with the capital appreciation side of the return equation. The stock market was maturing as were investors.\n\nIn the latest JP Morgan Guide to the Markets they compared dividend to capital appreciation by decade going back to the 1950s:\n\nYou can see dividends were still a healthy 3-5% from the 1950s through the 1980s. Now you can see a slow progression down in the importance of dividend yields since the 1990s.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this shift is the increase is stock buybacks. In the early 1980s, the SEC instituted a new regulation that gave corporations incentives to repurchase their own shares. You can clearly see how this trend has changed stock yields over time:\n\nDividend yields were already beginning to fall but buybacks have accelerated the process as corporations have used them as another way to return money to shareholders.\n\nAswath Damodaran broke these yields down by year on his blog recently:\n\nIt didn’t take long for the buyback yield to supplant the dividend yield on the S&P 500. In fact, the buyback yield has now been higher than the dividend yield for the past 9 years in a row.1\n\nAnother way of thinking about the shrinking importance of dividends is by looking at the yields on both the S&P 500 and more tech-heavy Nasdaq over time:\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has barely sniffed 1% in dividends but has still managed to outperform the S&P handily:\n\nYou could claim recency bias here but the Nasdaq has actually beaten the S&P over the long haul as well.\n\nFrom its inception in 1973, the Nasdaq Composite Index has returned roughly 11% per year. In that same time, the S&P 500 has returned around 10.4% annually.\n\nBeyond buybacks, one of the biggest reasons for the lower dividend yield on the S&P 500 is the change in sector composition over time.\n\nHere are the current sector weights of the S&P 500 along with the corresponding dividend yields:\n\nThe average dividend yield for the top 5 sectors by weighting (which make up over 75% of the index) is 1.6%. The average dividend yield for the bottom 6 sectors (which make up less than 25% of the index) is 2.5%.\n\nThis is mostly a U.S. phenomenon. International stocks still have higher dividend rates:\n\nThis is partly buybacks, partly sectors, and partly the stronger performance in the U.S.\n\nI’m not saying dividend strategies don’t matter anymore; just that dividends don’t play as big of a role in market cap weighted U.S. indexes as much as they used to.\n\nIt’s certainly possible dividend-based strategies or even those sectors with higher dividends could do better from here, especially given the strong run in tech stocks over the past decade or so.\n\nBut it is fascinating to see witness the structural changes in the way dividends are viewed over time.\n\nIn the past, dividends were the only reason investors placed their money in equities. Now, dividends play a much smaller role, for better or worse, in the overall stock market.\n\nFurther Reading:\nThe Half-Life of Investment Strategies\n\n1Cue the conspiracy crowd who will complain the market has been manipulated by buybacks.\n\n \n",

          "description": "Buttigieg’s staunch support of Israel bucks the Democratic party’s trend.\n \nPete Buttigieg may be a rising star in the 2020 Democratic field, but his strong pro-Israel views may put him at odds with the increasingly pro-Palestinian left flank in his own party.\n\nThe 37-year-old openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has in the past described Israel as a model for the US in how to deal with security threats. He’s blamed most of the suffering in Gaza on Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist political organization and militant group that has run the territory since 2007. And he’s strongly rejected condemnations of Israel — and US support for it — made by progressive lawmakers.\n\nThat’s not to say he’s completely ignored the plight of Palestinians — he hasn’t. During a March campaign stop in Iowa, Buttigieg said he wants America to help make “a world where Israelis and Palestinians are able to live in peace side by side.” Overall, though, Buttigieg has shown a willingness to back Israel.\n\nThat puts him in stark contrast with the more progressive wing of his own party. Poll after poll has shown that liberal Democratic primary voters are less sympathetic to Israel than they were in years past. It also shows he disagrees with some first-term Representatives, particularly Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\nSeveral of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, most notably Sen. Bernie Sanders, are also far more critical of Israel than Buttigieg. Sanders has repeatedly condemned Israel for violence at its border with Gaza, where time and time again Israeli forces have killed mostly unarmed protesters — including women and children — pleading for an end to the decade-long Israeli blockade of food, fuel, and medicine.\n\nA senior foreign policy adviser for Buttigieg told me that “Pete doesn’t see the Israel-Palestinian issue as a zero-sum game” and while he doesn’t support the politics of far-right Israli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he still supports Israel and views it as an ally and democratic state.\n\nStill, the mayor may enjoy surprising support now, but it’s possible his Israel views will doom him among Democrats in the end.\n\nButtigieg continues to make many pro-Israel statements\n\nThe former Navy intelligence officer has spoken about Israel openly for at least a year.\n\nLast May, Buttigieg took a trip to Israel with other mayors that was organized by the American Jewish Committee, a global Jewish advocacy organization. Shortly after his return, Buttigieg was interviewed for the organization’s podcast. That was tough timing, as just four days earlier Israeli forces had killed dozens of Palestinians protesting the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. \n\nStill, Buttigieg had nothing but high praise for Israel, suggesting its way of handling security threats could be a good model for the US.\n\nCourtesy of the American Jewish Committee.\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Democratic presidential candidate, on Temple Mount near the Dome of Rock Mosque alongside Columbus, Ohio Mayor Andy Ginther, now former West Palm Beach, Florida Mayor Jeri Muoio, and Dayton, Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley on May 10, 2018.\n\n“Seeing the way that a country can be on the one hand very intentional, very serious, and very effective when it comes to security and on the other hand not allowing concerns about security to dominate your consciousness,” he said, “I think that’s a very important lesson that hopefully Americans can look to when we think about how to navigate a world that unfortunately has become smaller and more dangerous for all of us.”\n\nButtigieg’s foreign policy adviser, though, told me the mayor’s “comments were by no means any endorsement of Netanyahu’s policies.”\n\nButtigieg also said many of the problems facing Gaza were Hamas’ fault.\n\n“There really is not a unified or single voice for the Palestinian people,” Buttigieg said. “Most people aren’t aware of the difference between what’s happening in Gaza — run by Hamas in a way that is contributing to a lot of misery there — but also totally different than an environment where you’d have a negotiating partner across the table.” \n\nThere’s no doubt that Hamas has failed to govern the territory well, to the point that Palestinians living there are protesting the group. But much of the humanitarian hardship is undoubtedly also caused by Israel’s blockade.\n\nAnd the more recent statements he’s made on the topic of Israel suggest his views remain largely the same as they were in that May interview. \n\nDuring a January 31 appearance on The View, for instance, he was asked to respond to comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) where she criticized Israel for violating human rights and even compared its conduct to Iran’s.\n\nButtigieg, a married gay man, countered strongly. “People like me get strung up in Iran,” he said, “so the idea that what’s going on is equivalent is just wrong.”\n\nHe continued: “They’ve [Israel] also got to figure out — and we’ve got to figure out with them as an ally — what the regional security picture is going to look like there,” he said. He added that an Israeli general during his May 2018 trip told his delegation the most complicated problem facing Israel is Iran.\n\n“It’s always been one of the most fiendishly complicated issues and simple answers will not serve us well at a time like this,” he said.\n\nMultiple opportunities, multiple defenses of Israel. It’s pretty clear, then, where Buttigieg stands. The problem for him is that he increasingly stands alone.\n\nThe Democrats are sparring over their views on Israel\n\nProgressive Democrats are much less shy about voicing criticisms of Israel and championing pro-Palestinian views.\n\nSanders, a top contender for the Democratic nomination, has consistently backed Palestinians in Gaza over Netanyahu’s government.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during the “We the People” summit featuring 2020 presidential candidates, at the Warner Theatre on April 1, 2019 in Washington, DC. \n\nAs the Atlantic’s Peter Beinart pointed out in February, “He’s produced videos that call Gaza an ‘open-air prison,’ he’s depicted Benjamin Netanyahu as part of the ‘growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism,’ and, most controversially of all, he’s suggested cutting US military aid to Israel.”\n\nProgressives also put pressure on Democratic candidates to skip an annual conference organized last month by a pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Surprisingly, Buttigieg, along with many other Democratic hopefuls, didn’t go (although some did).\n\nAnd while not in the presidential race, Muslim lawmakers like Omar and Tlaib continue to speak out against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians — which of course has resulted in blowback on them and Democrats more generally.\n\nThere’s a reason Democratic candidates are having an easier time either ignoring or outright criticizing Israel these days. A 2018 Pew Research poll showed that only 27 percent of Democrats said they sympathized with Israel, an 11-point drop from 2001. Meanwhile, Republican sympathy jumped 29 points to 79 percent in the same time frame. \n\nIt’s partly led President Donald Trump to incorrectly label Democrats anti-Israel and even anti-Jewish. \n\nIsrael, then, will continue to be a sore spot for the Democratic party and arguably the most important foreign policy issue of the primaries. Buttigieg has already made his pro-Israel case. The question is if voters will reward him for it.",

          "description": "For 30 years, China took in the world’s plastic. What happened when they stopped?\n \nFor all the campaigns encouraging people to recycle more, few lay out exactly what happens to our recyclables once they go into the blue bin. Rather than our milk jugs magically reincarnating into toys on their own, for nearly three decades American recyclables were shipped cheaply to China, where they could be sold and given new shape. \n\nThat worked well enough, until China started cracking down. With dirty waste continuing to appear in imported recyclables, the rising cost of labor, and an abundance of the country’s own potentially recyclable waste, China no longer had the same financial and environmental incentives to accept the world’s waste. \n\nWithin the recycling community, there had been rumblings that China might change its policies, but the force of Operation National Sword, announced in July 2017, still came as a surprise. Going into full effect last March, it banned 24 types of scrap and implemented much stricter and more rigorous contamination standards which have been described as “impossible to reach.” As a result, local governments and the recycling industry are now facing an unprecedented recycling crisis, especially in plastics.\n\nK. Y. Cheng/South China Morning Post via Getty Images\nPlastic recycling must now meet “impossible” contamination standards. \n\nTo put the impact of this current crisis into the context of past waste crises — like the Love Canal Disaster, where a residential neighborhood was built on a toxic waste dump with disastrous consequences, leading to the formation of the EPA’s Superfund program — and to understand how the effects of this policy are being felt across the United States, The Goods spoke to Kate O’Neill, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at UC Berkeley. Specializing in global environmental politics and the global politics of waste, her upcoming book Waste explores the extent to which waste can be a resource, and she has written and spoken extensively about the recycling trade with China. \n\nWhat’s the history of the US sending recyclables to China?\n\nChina imported most of the world’s scrap, the good stuff as well as the more problematic, especially as its industry started to boom in the late ’90s and early 2000s. It was also connected with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. That was a period where China’s growth started booming. It was shipping goods to Europe and the States and that enabled a cheap process of shipping the scrap back to China in the holds of the ships that had brought all the stuff over. So that made it cheaper to ship to China than, say, to ship recycling across the country. And China was the market — that’s where it went to be used. We were shipping it to China because there was demand from its manufacturing sector because it wasn’t producing enough virgin plastic. So there was an economic rationale.\n\nIs it that China doesn’t need our recyclables now that they have enough of their own?\n\nIt produces plastics for its domestic market and has a lot of plastic scrap of its own to recycle. This is very similar to the dynamics with electronic waste, because China imported a lot of that for a while, and illegally for quite a while too, and then started really cleaning up its recycling villages and creating more industrial parks for domestic recycling. It’s trying to do the same with plastics. \n\nI also think Beijing is very concerned about their environmental quality and image overseas. As China is taking on this role as the world’s economic superpower, there are aspects that are not just pure economics or military power, but a sort of leadership by example. We see it with efforts in China to combat climate change. I also think that they were very concerned about being seen as the world’s dump site.\n\nHow do past rumblings and claims of crisis compare to now? Is the shit hitting the fan?\n\n“Oh, the shit’s hitting the fan”\n\nOh, the shit’s hitting the fan. Operation Green Fence was the 2013 effort to just start getting exporting countries to clean their recycling, their plastics in particular. That sent ripples, but that was more enforcing existing legislation, it wasn’t a severe cut in contamination limits. The recycling industry saw it as more of a, “Well, let’s kind of clean up our act at the collection stage and not bother the consumers with this.” What happened was that suddenly a whole cleaning services industry sprang up in Southeast Asia, so you knew you could ship it to Malaysia where it would be cleaned if it didn’t meet China’s specifications. \n\nAbsolutely no one thinks they’re going to lift this restriction at any point, and it’s really been exacerbated by the trade war with the US. [China has] had periodic disruptions, just temporary ones, on the import of other kinds of scrap like iron, copper, and aluminum. But there’s demand in their own recycling industries for that so it’d be tricky for Beijing to say no to importing that kind of scrap. But plastics now, no one sees any lifting on those restrictions anytime soon. \n\nIt seems like this is a type of crisis we’ve never had to face before, but based on impact does it compare to anything else?\n\nOnly nuclear waste. Obviously it’s not the same as a widespread nuclear waste accident, but I think it’s the most widespread, and I would definitely call this the most high-profile and prolonged period I’ve seen waste in the global press in many, many years. \n\nThinking back over early waste crises, again, it’s not quite the same danger to human health, but it’s on par with Love Canal and those big events in the ’60s and ’70s. We’ve really been displacing those risks — out of sight, out of mind — either to poor minority communities in the case of hazardous waste, or now to displacing our plastic and paper waste to communities where — although it’s used in China — it was being disassembled and reprocessed by people who are very much being exposed to the worst risks. \n\nHow is this going to start impacting our lives here in the US?\n\nIt already has in so many ways. There’s the ripple effect for our lives and also globally. Initially the plan was just to divert the plastics to different places like Southeast Asia. That has not been working because countries like Malaysia and Thailand have become overwhelmed with plastic and stopped importing. India just announced it would not take plastics, so the quest for markets is still ongoing.\n\nThere’s a lot of campaigns for consumer education, getting rid of what the industry calls “wish cycling” [the well-intentioned attempt to recycle nonrecyclables, which causes contamination and more waste] and encouraging people to properly wash recyclables. You’ve got a shift away from single-stream recycling, when you put everything into the one big container, to multiple stream, where you’re separating recyclables into different containers. \n\n“There was no matching or building of recycling capacity along with the increase in recycling programs”\n\nWe’re seeing an increase in landfilling, and because most states have fees for landfills, that’s creating an additional expense [for municipalities]. Plastics went from [selling for] like $300 a ton at their peak to now where you almost have to pay to get rid of them. Municipalities are cutting back on their recycling and what they will pick up, some places have stopped recycling altogether. This includes not just plastic but also glass, not because it was ever exported to China but because it’s difficult and expensive to recycle in the first place, so when you’re losing money because of plastics you’re not going to keep propping up a real economic loss generator like glass.\n\nAfter years of hearing that we should recycle more, it’s pretty shocking to realize that we don’t have an infrastructure that can deal with all of it. \n\nRecycling started in the ’70s and ’80s but it took a while to really spread and certainly to become kind of mandatory. [Over the past 20 years] there was no matching or building of recycling capacity along with the increase in recycling programs. I was living in New York in the mid ’90s and I remember when the recycling came in, that maps directly onto the years when we started exporting to China. \n\nThere’s an interesting debate warming up about if we should focus on improving our recycling or if that is going to enable our continued consumption of plastics. In other words, let’s not focus on recycling, let’s just focus on not using plastics. I personally think that we need to do both, and I’m concerned about this argument that we shouldn’t even be improving recycling, that we just need to focus on not using plastic, because that seems like a lot harder of a goal to reach. \n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?

          "description": "The bowline is one of the most useful knots you can know. Simple to tie, and easy to undo, the beauty of the bowline is that it creates a quick loop secured by a knot that tightens when under load. Sailors use the bowline to fasten halyards and other rigging which require a super-secure connection.  \n\nThe one-handed bowline is a technique that allows you to tie the knot using only one hand. Why is that useful? Imagine you’ve slipped and fallen into a rushing river. At the last second, you grab the branch of a tree, but you can’t pull yourself up. A friend tosses you a rope to tie around yourself, but the only knots you can tie would require the use of both hands. With a one-handed bowline, you can secure a loop around your body while still holding onto the branch. In most scenarios this is a survival knot tied around your waist, but it can be adapted to a number of circumstances.  \n\nLike this illustrated guide?

          "description": "Today, the US Justice Department charged dozens of parents (including a few celebrities), college coaches, and standardized test administrators in a made-for-TV scheme in which parents paid bribes to help their kids cheat on tests and gain admission to elite universities on sham athletic scholarships.\n\nThe indictment reveals a sorry state of affairs in which parents were willing to fork over tens of thousands of dollars to a college prep company, called the Edge College & Career Network, to finagle a spot for their kids on the tennis team at Georgetown, the water polo team at University of Southern California, or the soccer team at Yale, in spite of the fact that the kids did not play these sports at a high level. Other parents employed the company to help get special treatment when taking college entrance exams, by applying for extra time to complete the tests, or hiring someone else to take them in their stead, or flat-out correcting their answers after the fact.\n\nIt’s hard to know where to start with all the things that are wrong with this. There is some epically bad parenting at work here. These kids’ role models showed them that how you get ahead in life is not hard work, perseverance, or discipline, but lying and cheating. These families clearly have means and privilege—among those indicted are Hollywood actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman—but what happens to these kids’ self-esteem, knowing it took a hefty bribe for them to get what others work for?\n\nThe bribes, the cheating, the lying: it’s all for nothing. The prestige of a university does not determine what a student learns, their happiness at school, or how satisfied they are with their lives after graduation. It’s possible that parents willing to lie and cheat don’t care about these things, but chances are they thought their kids needed a high-end education to get ahead in life.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nA Stanford researcher last year wrote a paper, “A ‘Fit’ Over Rankings: Why College Engagement Matters More Than Selectivity,” that showed better learning was associated with better studying, not the brand name of an institution. Kids who studied the most learned the most; students who put the most effort put into coursework gained a better understanding of their subject and general knowledge; and the more engaged the kids were with coursework, the more curious and creative they became.\n\n“It appears that what students do in college is far more important than the type of institution they attend,” the research concluded.\n\nAnd what about happiness and general life satisfaction? Since 2014, Gallup-Purdue has conducted a survey of college graduates, asking about workplace engagement and personal well-being. The 2014 results included 1,557 associate-degree and 29,560 bachelor’s-degree holders and found no relationship between college selectivity and broad measures of life satisfaction. What seems to matter instead is “what students are doing in college and how they are experiencing it.” The report compiles six college experiences that have an impact on how fulfilled graduates feel later in life:\n\nTaking a course with a professor who makes learning exciting\n\nWorking with professors who care about students professionally\n\nFinding a mentor who encourages students to follow personal goals\n\nWorking on a project across several semesters\n\nParticipating in an internship that applies classroom learning\n\nBeing active in extracurricular activities\n\nLisa Damour, author of Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls, says that most parents want their kids to grow up to be happy, but they wrongly think that path relies on professional and financial success. Since the future if uncertain, parents focus on grades and test scores, the data closest at hand. She cites research by psychologist Daniel Kanheman that shows adult well-being is driven by high-quality relationships, feeling one’s work has meaning, and feeling one is becoming more skilled in that work.\n\nInstead of pushing kids hard on grades, tests, and the like, Damour says that if you want to push, push on what matters, like fostering meaningful relationships, cultivating interests, and instilling discipline.\n\n“How do they treat the people around them?” she asks. “Do they conduct relationships in ways that they feel good about? And do they get into relationships that seem to be positive for them? Are they able to discover what they can do with their talents that feels important and meaningful to them? Do they have the discipline they need to become increasingly skilled at those things?”\n",

          "description": "Businesses from American Airlines to American Apparel have filed for Chapter 11. Why haven’t they closed?\n \nBankruptcy leaves the impression of utter failure, and when a company goes bankrupt, it’s easy to assume that it’s dead, may it rest in peace. According to this line of thinking, here’s an alarming tidbit: If you regularly travel by plane, there’s a decent chance you’ve flown with an airline that was bankrupt at the time. United filed for bankruptcy in 2002, followed by Delta in 2005 and American Airlines in 2011.\n\nWhile bankruptcy can result in the liquidation or sale of a company, it also presents an opportunity for it to restructure while continuing to operate, suspend or reconfigure debt payment, and get back on its feet, so to speak. That was the case for United, Delta, and American, which all exited bankruptcy in less than four years. Since 2017, we’ve seen a wave of once-powerful retailers going the same route, like Sears, Mattress Firm, the clothing brand BCBG, and the accessories chain Claire’s.\n\nThe idea of corporate bankruptcy as a reset button is an American invention dating to the 19th century, says Fordham law professor Richard Squire. A boom in the railroad industry had led to over-building, and with too many railroads, some inevitably failed. But these businesses still had value, having invested heavily in laying down rails and building engines and cars. People realized that the cash generated by liquidating these assets — selling them off piece by piece — wouldn’t be as great as the gains from letting the railroads continue to operate.\n\nWith too many railroads, some inevitably failed. But these businesses still had value.\n\n“It didn’t make sense to shut them down, or you would destroy a lot of economic value,” says Squire. \n\nSo the legal world came up with a solution: The troubled railroads wouldn’t get shut down, or at least not entirely, and the creditors to whom money was owed would become the companies’ new shareholders. It was an exchange of equity for debt. Businesses in other industries started doing the same thing, and reorganization eventually came to be known as Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. \n\nReorganization in bankruptcy has also become an American export, says Squire, having been picked up in some form by the UK, Italy, Germany, and Singapore, among others. Under American law, the same managers who drove the company into bankruptcy are allowed to continue operating the business, which some observers initially saw as “hiring the fox to guard the hen house.” \n\n“There was a lot of skepticism in the rest of the world about the reorganization process,” says Squire. “But over time jurisdictions increasingly recognized that they were shutting down valuable businesses. If you liquidate a business, everyone loses their jobs. The employees all get fired, suppliers now have nobody to work with. They realized that bankruptcy the way [it was traditionally done] is very disruptive, so maybe we could try something like the American system.”\n\nOn a more philosophical level, the notion of second chances in business seems to come out of a specifically American mindset toward reinvention — or at least an outlook that gels with America’s mythology about itself. It’s the idea that the conditions of one’s birth shouldn’t determine one’s lot in life, that you can come from anywhere and climb your way to the top. \n\nThis optimistic narrative isn’t entirely true, of course, with systemic inequality evident in the growing racial wealth gap and the intersecting gender pay gap. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s stance on immigration makes clear that where a person was born very much matters to the United States government. (President Trump’s businesses, it bears noting, have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a number of times.)\n\nBy extension, one stumble shouldn’t mean that a retailer must shut down forever. Under that threat of failure, what reasonable person would start a business in the first place?\n\nBankruptcy can play out in a number of ways, from reorganization to liquidation\n\nJust because a retailer can reorganize through bankruptcy doesn’t mean it ought to go that route. Chapter 11 is not meant to provide permanent relief from debt payment, so if a company’s liquidation value is greater than its revenue potential, shutting operations down entirely may very well be the best option. Liquidation is also known as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in which a court-appointed trustee sells off the retailer’s assets — merchandise and store fixtures, intellectual property, etc. — in order to pay off its creditors in a prescribed order of priority. These are the two chapters used by bankrupt businesses; Chapter 12 is designed for “family farmers” or “family fishermen,” and Chapter 13 is for individuals.\n\nOne of the biggest determinants in whether a company should attempt to restructure is simply whether it has a reason to exist\n\nOne of the biggest determinants in whether a company should liquidate or attempt to restructure is simply whether it has a reason to exist, says Melissa Kibler, a senior managing director at Mackinac Partners who works as an accountant on bankruptcy-induced reorganizations. (Bankruptcy court gets final approval over the reorganization plan, as well as any major business decisions that take place during bankruptcy.) If a company has too many powerful competitors or if it’s in a sector that’s suffering as a whole — as brick-and-mortar retail has been, due to Amazon and the rise of online shopping — the answer may be no.\n\nIt also matters why a company needs to file for bankruptcy. It’s easier to fix a good business that’s taken on too much debt than it is to overhaul one whose sales have declined because customers have lost interest.\n\nWhen Kibler works with a retailer that’s considering filing for bankruptcy, she and the client look at a variety of metrics that indicate whether it’s a viable business and what changes would need to be made to make that the case. They track sales for stores that have been open for at least a year, a number that excludes the inflationary effect of newly opened locations and indicates which direction sales are moving in. They look at individual stores to diagnose their problems: Is it a bad location that doesn’t get much foot traffic? Is the product assortment tailored properly to the local shopper base? Are there too many or too few staffers on the floor? \n\nThese are questions that a retailer should be asking itself all the time, but they’re especially relevant when they’re figuring out a plan of attack for a reorganization, whether that means shutting down underperforming stores or overhauling the product.\n\nReorganization efforts often fail, and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy can end in liquidation of some or all of the company’s assets\n\nWhile Chapter 11 bankruptcy is focused on a company reorganizing and paying off its debt, it has a variety of possible outcomes. Reorganization efforts often fail, and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy can end in liquidation of some or all of the company’s assets. \n\nThis is what happened to Borders Books: Once the country’s second-largest bookseller, it was hit sideways by the rise of Amazon and e-books, and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2011. It was hoping for a buyout by a private equity firm, but the deal fell through, and in an absence of other buyers, the company announced its liquidation plans that July, shuttering its nearly 400 remaining stores. In the fire sale, Borders competitor Barnes & Noble snapped up its intellectual property and database of 48 million customers for $13.9 million.\n\n(Why not just file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy then? Well, liquidation might not have been the hoped-for outcome, but even if it was, Chapter 11 allows management to choose its own liquidation firms and to sell off other assets, like intellectual property. In Chapter 7, everything would be liquidated by an appointed case trustee.)\n\nIndeed, many Chapter 11 cases these days end with a company selling off its intellectual property — in essence, its brand name and assets like its customer database — to a private equity firm or a competitor, especially in the retail world. For Barnes & Noble, it might be enough to make use of Borders’ customer information and let the brand lie fallow, but for other players, the purchase of a retailer’s IP is cause for a reboot.\n\nBankruptcy can end with a brand relaunch under new management\n\nWe’ve seen a number of retailers go bankrupt and relaunch under new management in the past few years. When American Apparel filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 2016, closing all of its stores, Gildan Activewear bought its intellectual property and relaunched it with some tweaks to its infamous marketing style. Nasty Gal was acquired out of bankruptcy by the British fast fashion brand Boohoo in February 2017, though its resuscitation came with complaints of poor customer service.\n\nGildan and Boohoo bought American Apparel and Nasty Gal’s names but none of their existing operations, supply chains, or debt. In essence, the brands looked much the same — if less risqué, in the case of American Apparel — but under the hood, they were totally different. At its clumsiest, this can create a sort of zombie effect, where things just seem off.\n\nIt’s a tough road, though. Ramez Toubassy, the president of brands at Gordon Brothers, describes the valuation of a bankrupt brand’s intellectual property as an art and a science. Gordon Brothers is best known as a liquidator, but Toubassy led its March 2017 acquisition of Wet Seal’s brand name after the mall retailer shut down all of its stores and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier that year.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for a brand to stumble and file for bankruptcy again — what those in the business jokingly call a “Chapter 22”\n\nWhen a brand name like that goes on the market, Toubassy sets about figuring out where and how long ago its revenue peaked, and how much affinity and awareness the brand has among potential shoppers — indicators of whether it would be worth the time, capital, and risk involved in a relaunch. And he says he’d need to have a clear view of what would be done differently this time around to escape the pitfalls of the past. \n\nIt’s not uncommon for a brand to relaunch out of bankruptcy only to stumble and file for bankruptcy again — what those in the bankruptcy business jokingly call a “Chapter 22.” While Chapters 7 and 13 impose waiting periods for filing a second time, Chapter 11 bankruptcy generally comes with no such rules, and Chapter 22s have become common in the retail world recently, highlighting the challenging nature of the business right now.\n\nIn the case of Wet Seal, Toubassy took notes from the success of the hyper-popular fashion e-commerce site Fashion Nova, which is known for its collaborations with Cardi B, cloning everything the Kardashians wear, and releasing clothing in a mind-melting 24 hours. In September 2017, Toubassy’s team relaunched Wet Seal as a “crowdsourced, fast-fashion e-tailer,” dispensing with the brick-and-mortar business model that helped drag it down the drain and adopting Fashion Nova’s speedy mentality and direct-to-consumer business model. Has it been successful? Well, thus far Wet Seal hasn’t had to file for a “Chapter 33,” having been through the process twice previously.\n\nThere are certain advantages to building a new company around an existing brand name, rather than starting fresh: Though it may have been tarnished somewhat by bankruptcy, customers are already familiar (and, ideally, friendly) with it. But a brand name is also what Toubassy calls “an expiring asset.” Increasingly, firms like Gordon Brothers need to minimize the time between acquisition and relaunch as much as possible: Customers are more distractible than ever and have many brands vying for their attention, and digital commerce means algorithms that deprioritize players not actively in the game.\n\n“I would say if you’re not back up and running with e-commerce in six months, you’d better have a good reason,” Toubassy says.\n\nFor bankrupt retailers, reorganization is increasingly unlikely\n\nThe system that Squire described, one in which a company can restructure via Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, isn’t a realistic option for many retailers today. That’s in part due to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), a 2005 amendment to the US Bankruptcy Code. \n\nPreviously, bankrupt retailers had 60 days to either reject or accept their store leases, but they could ask the court for repeated extensions of that deadline — “often for the full duration of a debtor’s bankruptcy case,” according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Under BAPCPA, retailers now get a maximum of 210 days (a 120-day deadline, plus a single 90-day extension) to make that decision. No further extensions are granted without the landlord’s consent.\n\nRetailers now have significantly less time to figure out which stores they ought to keep open and which they should close\n\nThis matters because it put a massive time crunch on retailers, which now have significantly less time to figure out which stores they ought to keep open and which they should close. It takes 120 days to organize and run a going-out-of-business sale, says Kibler, effectively giving the retailer a mere 90 days to figure out its store closure strategy. On the flip side, BAPCPA leveled the playing field for landlords: If a bankrupt retailer wants to get out of a store lease, it generally only has to pay between one and three years’ rent, even if it has another nine years left on its contract.\n\nThough Kibler says the restructuring analysis that used to take place during bankruptcy now happens before a company files, this time pressure has contributed to retailers being less likely to reorganize and more prone to liquidate and sell their intellectual property. \n\nIt’s not the only reason, though. As Kibler said, a company needs to have a really good reason to reorganize — a good reason to exist — and the rise of e-commerce has made retailers with massive store presences obsolete. Second chances may be a beloved American ideal, but so is innovation and the growing pains that come with it.\n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox? Sign up for our newsletter here. ",

          "description": "Warren, Sanders, and Harris all come out in support of Omar.\n\nAt least three Democratic presidential candidates have come out in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), whose recent questioning of pro-Israel lobbying groups and the United State’s political alliance with Israel has come under fire for feeding into anti-Semitic conspiracies.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said the attacks against Omar were “wrong” and “stifling debate.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said “branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse.” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) says she worries Omar is being targeted in a way that “may put her at risk.”\n\nTensions within the Democratic Party have been growing over the past week, as Democratic leadership has been under pressure to rebuke Omar’s comments but also avoid falling in line with a conservative campaign to paint Omar, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, as an anti-Semite.\n\nThe backlash against Omar began when the first-term Congress member from Minnesota tweeted that American politicians’ support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins,” which many saw as directly tied to an anti-Semitic conspiracy about Jewish magnates buying off American politicians.\n\nThen in a discussion about the anti-Semitism allegations against her, Omar said she was trying to “talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, which Omar sits on, called it “a vile anti-Semitic slur”; some Democrats and Republicans interpreted her comment as feeding into a longstanding anti-Semitic trope that Jewish people are disloyal citizens of their own countries.\n\nOthers 2020 candidates, like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) took a different tone than Warren, Sanders and Harris. Booker said he found Omar’s comments “disturbing,” while recognizing that some of the attacks against her had “anti-Islamic sentiment.” Gillibrand said that “those with critical views of Israel, such as Congresswoman Omar, should be able to express their views without employing anti-Semitic tropes about money or influence,” also highlighting the hypocrisy in the Republican Party for censuring Omar, but saying “little or nothing” when President Donald Trump “defended white supremacists at Charlottesville.”\n\nHouse Democratic leadership publicly censured Omar for careless word choice in a statement and is planning to hold a vote on a resolution Thursday that rebukes anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and white supremacy (without naming Omar directly).\n\nBut many more progressive Democrats — including Warren, Harris, and Sanders, who are running for president — are sticking with Omar, calling the attacks an attempt to silence debate on Israel.\n\nWhat Sanders, Harris, and Warren said\n\nWhile support for Israel among Americans remains strong overall, support for Palestine is at an all-time high, according to a February poll from Gallup — primarily driven by liberal Democrats. That’s probably why the most progressive 2020 candidates are coming out in support of Omar — and, more notably, in support of having a debate about Israel policy.\n\n“What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate,” Sanders said in a statement. “That’s wrong.”\n\nIn a statement, Harris said “we all have a responsibility to speak out against anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and all forms of hatred and bigotry, especially as we see a spike in hate crimes in America.” She added that there is a difference between criticism of policy and anti-Semitism:\n\nBut like some of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, I am concerned that the spotlight being put on Congresswoman Omar may put her at risk. We should be having a sound, respectful discussion about policy. You can both support Israel and be loyal to our country. I also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism. At the end of the day, we need a two-state solution and a commitment to peace, human rights, and democracy by all leaders in the region — and a commitment by our country to help achieve that.\n\nWarren took a similar tack. In a statement, she said:\n\nWe have a moral duty to combat hateful ideologies in our own country and around the world — and that includes both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement. “In a democracy, we can and should have an open, respectful debate about the Middle East that focuses on policy. Branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Threats of violence — like those made against Rep. Omar — are never acceptable.\n\nIn a 2020 primary where many of the biggest Democratic nominees more or less agree on the big-ticket domestic issues, foreign policy, especially when it comes to Israel, will offer much more room for debate.\n\nOmar’s comments certainly provide an early test of how the future of Democratic leadership sees the issue.\n",

          "description": "The conversation must center on the plight of the Palestinians.\n\nA controversy is brewing in Washington, DC, over Rep. Ilhan Omar’s comments about the influence of Israel lobby groups and the uncritical support that many members of Congress give Israel’s increasingly hardline, right-wing government. Backlash against Omar’s remarks even prompted House Democrats to make plans to introduce and vote on a resolution this week that would conflate statements like her with anti-Semitism. However, pressure from the Congressional Black and Progressive caucuses forced them to “put off” the issue.\n\nBut amid the frenzy, there’s been a glaring lack of context surrounding Omar’s beliefs. Perhaps most of all, there has been total disregard for the plight of the Palestinian people.\n\nOne might be inclined to ask, “Why is Rep. Omar steadfast in her criticism of Israeli policies and groups like AIPAC, knowing it will spark attacks, smears, and mischaracterizations?” One of the core issues of the Palestinian human rights struggle is that Palestinians have faced 70 years of refugeehood. Omar, who is a refugee herself and continues to identify as such, chooses to uplift the voices and affirm the struggle of refugees worldwide — including Palestinians. As a researcher of the Palestinian diaspora, and as a descendant of a Palestinian family that was ethnically cleansed from their land in 1967, it is a relief to me to finally hear voices in Washington speaking out for Palestinian rights like that of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Reps. Betty McCollum, Rashida Tlaib, and Omar.\n\nOmar has experienced firsthand how innocent humans pay the price for militarism, warfare, and systemic injustice, and is using her platform to protect the most vulnerable. She challenges the Democratic Party to adopt a more progressive and humane foreign policy, one that will not inflict upon others the type of suffering she has faced. Instead of dismissing her, or questioning her role on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, we should defer to her expertise as a survivor of war and refugeehood.\n\nOmar has shared her own story of fleeing civil war in her homeland of Somalia, living in a refugee camp, being unable to dream of a better future in those harsh conditions, and how her passion for public service was born while serving as her late grandfather’s interpreter in the US as a teen. She knows intimately how innocent civilians are forced to endure injustice from governments and other powerful actors, and is attempting to use her voice as a member of Congress to protect the most vulnerable.\n\nFor her, this means speaking up for victims of the Saudi war on Yemen and citizens living under the brutal Saudi regime. It also means speaking up for the Palestinians. Just as it is becoming clearer to many Americans that a progressive agenda in the United States includes solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom and equality, Omar’s support for Palestinians is part of her core belief system. As such, she and other new members of Congress are creating the space for others to speak up on this issue without fear.\n\nOmar was elected in 2018, a remarkably deadly year for Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli military. According to a United Nations Human Rights Council Report, the Israeli military killed 138 protesters and injured more than 9,000 others between March and December of that year. They protested to demand an end to 70 years of refugeehood, while also demanding an end to Israel’s cruel and illegal siege of Gaza during weekly protests known as the Great March of Return.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is an essential source of humanitarian aid, such as social services, health care, and education, to Palestinian refugees. Surviving on international aid and living in dire conditions in impoverished camps, Omar experienced as a young girl what many Palestinian refugees go through today.\n\nApproximately 70 percent of the 2 million Palestinians in the tiny, besieged Gaza Strip are refugees, survivors or descendants of those who were expelled from their homes during Israel’s establishment in 1948, known as the Nakba (“catastrophe”) to Palestinians. On top of the harsh conditions for 70 years and counting, all of Gaza’s residents also live under Israeli blockade and siege, ongoing since 2007. Regarded as a measure of collective punishment, the Palestinians of Gaza are cut off from other Palestinians and the world.\n\nTravel restrictions make it difficult for residents to move freely. Residents have less than four hours of electricity a day, with rising suicide, poverty, and unemployment rates. The US government, which provides billions of dollars in military funding to Israel every year, is bolstering these violent actions.\n\nOmar has prompted what for some is an uncomfortable debate. She has exposed the double standards and hypocrisy of many old-guard Democratic Party leaders who speak out against racism and injustice in the United States but overlook the racism and injustice that Israel imposes upon the Palestinians. It signals how far out of touch they are with Democratic voters and Americans in general, particularly progressives, young people, and people of color, who are increasingly critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinians struggling for their freedom.\n\nIn her recent statements that have drawn accusations of anti-Semitism, Omar was clear that her critique was focused on a lobbyist group, the actions of the Israeli military, and the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. States, militaries, and lobby groups are not and should not be beyond critique — Omar showed that by recently criticizing the role of Saudi financial influence in Washington.\n\nWe should consider why it is so much easier for some to believe that a young black refugee Muslim woman who wears hijab is motivated by anti-Semitism in her criticism of a lobbyist group, rather than by a desire to end warfare and the pain of refugeehood?\n\nOmar understands the plight of refugees, who live in uncertainty and sometimes cannot even dream of a better life. This is why she speaks out so boldly against groups like AIPAC, who lobby for pro-Israel policies as the nation continues to act with impunity, causing more Palestinian suffering and stifling the hope and dream that the Palestinians will one day be able to live in freedom and dignity in their own land.\n\nIf Democratic shifts and recent outcry in US public opinion on Netanyahu’s policies and Israeli military actions are any indicator, more like-minded progressives will join the ranks of Rep. Omar in the future. Democratic Party leaders would be wise to pay attention and stand on the right side of history by following their lead.\n\nHanna Alshaikh is Palestinian-American researcher of the activist and intellectual histories of the Palestinian diaspora, with a particular focus on Palestinians in the United States.

He shared some of his process with National Geographic:\n\nThe ingredients for Smilde’s clouds: just smoke and water vapor. He requires a cold and damp space with no air circulation, lest the clouds never form or fall straight to the ground. He mists an area with a spray bottle to put water vapor into the air. Then he turns on fog machines that spout tiny particles, and the vapor condenses around them.\n\nSmilde runs around the forming cloud, coaxing it into a shape about 10 feet across and six feet tall. Then he steps back long enough for a photographer to snap several images. Once the air clears, he’ll start over, repeating the process dozens of times until he’s happy with the results. Later, he’ll retouch the photos to remove his tools.\n\n(via moss & fog)\n\nTags: art   Berndnaut Smilde   clouds",

Even if all you have is Hyatt Discoverist elite status from the World of Hyatt Credit Card, that matches to M Life Pearl status and provides tangible perks, including free parking at M Life properties in Las Vegas.\n\nThat’s all valuable even at face value, but for years, there has been a really fun merry-go-round of elite status matches available with Hyatt and M Life that could perpetuate itself if you matched your status levels each year. If done correctly, you could put four Hyatt lounge passes (aka Hyatt Club Access Awards) in your virtual pockets each year with very little effort. This helped travelers save lots of money on food and drinks by enjoying Hyatt lounges on vacation in places like Grand Hyatt Kauai, Grand Hyatt Baha Mar, Hyatt Regency Coconut Point and beyond.\n\nSnacks in the lounge at Hyatt Coconut Point\n\nSadly, that specific status matching merry-go-round perk is likely closing for good on March 1 as the way Hyatt awards annual lounge passes is changing on that date. Beginning March 1, Hyatt Club Access Awards will no longer be awarded all at once with Hyatt Explorist elite status. Instead, they’ll be awarded based on your activity in Hyatt’s program, starting at 20 eligible nights in a calendar year.\n\nHowever, if you have M Life Gold status or above right now (even if you “earned” it by matching from Hyatt), you can potentially match that status back to Hyatt by Feb. 28 and earn a final round of four easy Hyatt Club Access Awards and Hyatt Explorist status that’s valid for another year.\n\nFor those looking to match (or re-match) their M Life status to Hyatt before March 1, here are the steps:\n\nHead to this M Life page and log in to your M Life account.\n\nScroll down to World of Hyatt Tier Match and select “Opt In.”\n\nEnter your World of Hyatt account information and sign in to your Hyatt account.\n\nYou should then be able to link your accounts and receive four additional Club Access Awards with a successful status match.\n\nNote that you may get an error message if your accounts are already linked, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it didn’t work. Try logging out of your Hyatt account and then logging back in to see if your four Club Access Awards have indeed been deposited in spite of the error message.\n\nNote that if you currently have Hyatt Globalist status, even if it is expiring after tomorrow, this status match from M Life doesn’t seem to work, as the system says your Hyatt status tier is already higher than what would be matched.\n\nIf you’re sad that this pathway to Hyatt club lounge access is closing, you could always ramp up the spending on your World of Hyatt Credit Card. That card comes with five annual elite qualifying nights and you can earn two more for every $5,000 you charge to the card. You only need to get to 20 annual nights with Hyatt to earn two lounge passes, so some Hyatt stays (remember, even award nights count) plus some spending on the card should get you there in no time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo earn a final round of easy Hyatt club lounge access passes for the next year, be sure and act on this status match now as the new rules for earning lounge passes based on Hyatt activity begin on March 1.\n\nFeatured image by author.\n",

          "description": "Using Artificial Intelligence to create works of art is a very controversial topic, and Invaluable has tackled explaining the issue with the infographic How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing the Face of Art and a detailed blog post. This issue applies to fine arts, music, writing, dance and even the culinary arts! When can it truly be considered “art”? Who owns the final creative works?\n\nOver the past 50 years, artists have been using computers to generate forms of digital art, but previously had to write the code that specified a set of rules to create the chosen aesthetics. Within the last couple of years, artists have taken AI art to a new level, using algorithms that learn these aesthetics themselves by analyzing thousands of images.\n\nThough many artists fear that relying on machines will hinder the essence of art and could even lead to replacing humans as creators, AI artists feel that machine-generated art is a new opportunity and the process is becoming an art form in itself. Much like famous artists of the past whose work was informed by concurrent social and political issues, artificial intelligence, working in conjunction with humans, has the ability to create art through those experiences as well.\n\nWithin the last decade, machine learning has become a growing medium that has permeated a variety of industries and disciplines, including the fine, performing, literary and culinary arts. While some worry that AI will stifle creativity and take jobs away from humans, artists offer a different perspective. By working with the capabilities of artificial intelligence machines, artists can use the technology as a tool for the augmentation of human thought to create what has yet to be imagined.\n\nThey also created a good animated GIF infographic to explain how AI can learn to write:\n\nBoth infographics are missing some design elements to help with sharing online. When publishing infographics, you have to assume they will be shared without the rest of the longer article they were originally published with.\n\nThe URL address back to the original infographic landing page (the blog post) or even the company website\n\nWhat’s the CTA (Call-To-Action)? What does Invaluable want the readers to do with this information? Even if it’s just “Learn More at Invaluable”.\n\nInclude a Copyright or Creative Commons license statement? Ironic that it’s missing since the topic is partially about who owns the creative works created by AI. Infographics are a creative work!\n\nThe data sources? The original blog post has links to a number of articles that were used as source material for the infographic (which is great!) but these need to be listed in the infographic itself. If I’m reading the infographic without the rest of the original blog post, why should I believe this information? Why is it credible?\n\nFound on TechiExpert\n",

          "description": "Price is the most delicate element of the marketing mix, and much thought goes into setting prices to nudge us towards spending more.\n\nThere’s one particularly cunning type of pricing strategy that marketers use to get you to switch your choice from one option to a more expensive or profitable one.\n\nIt’s called the decoy effect.\n\nImagine you are shopping for a Nutribullet blender. You see two options. The cheaper one, at $89, promotes 900 watts of power and a five-piece accessory kit. The more expensive one, at $149, is 1,200 watts and has 12 accessories.\n\nWhich one you choose will depend on some assessment of their relative value for money. It’s not immediately apparent, though, that the more expensive option is better value. It’s slightly less than 35% more powerful but costs nearly 70% more. It does have more than twice as many plastic accessories, but what are they worth?\n\nNow consider the two in light of a third option.\n\nThis one, for $125, offers 1,000 watts and nine accessories. It enables you to make what feels like a more considered comparison. For $36 more than the cheaper option, you get four more accessories and an extra 100 watts of power. But if you spend just $24 extra, you get a further three accessories and 200 watts more power. Bargain!\n\nYou have just experienced the decoy effect.\n\nAsymmetric dominance\n\nThe decoy effect is defined as the phenomenon whereby consumers change their preference between two options when presented with a third option—the “decoy”—that is “asymmetrically dominated.” It is also referred to as the “attraction effect” or “asymmetric dominance effect.”\n\nWhat asymmetric domination means is the decoy is priced to make one of the other options much more attractive. It is “dominated” in terms of perceived value (quantity, quality, extra features, and so on). The decoy is not intended to sell, just to nudge consumers away from the “competitor” and towards the “target”—usually the more expensive or profitable option.\n\nThe effect was first described by academics Joel Huber, John Payne, and Christopher Puto in a paper presented to a conference in 1981 (and later published in the Journal of Consumer Research in 1982).\n\nThey demonstrated the effect through experiments in which participants (university students) were asked to makes choices in scenarios involving beer, cars, restaurants, lottery tickets, films, and television sets.\n\nIn each product scenario participants first had to choose between two options. Then they were given a third option—a decoy designed to nudge them toward picking the target over the competitor. In every case except the lottery tickets the decoy successfully increased the probability of the target being chosen.\n\nThese findings were, in marketing terms, revolutionary. They challenged established doctrines—known as the “similarity heuristic” and the “regularity condition”—that a new product will take away market share from an existing product and cannot increase the probability of a customer choosing the original product.\n\nHow decoys work\n\nWhen consumers are faced with many alternatives, they often experience choice overload—what psychologist Barry Schwartz has termed the tyranny or paradox of choice. Multiple behavioral experiments have consistently demonstrated that greater choice complexity increases anxiety and hinders decision-making.\n\nIn an attempt to reduce this anxiety, consumers tend to simplify the process by selecting only a couple of criteria (say price and quantity) to determine the best value for money.\n\nThrough manipulating these key choice attributes, a decoy steers you in a particular direction while giving you the feeling you are making a rational, informed choice.\n\nThe decoy effect is thus a form of “nudging”—defined by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein (the pioneers of nudge theory) as “any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options.” Not all nudging is manipulative, and some argue that even manipulative nudging can be justified if the ends are noble. It has proven useful in social marketing to encourage people to make good decisions such as using less energy, eating healthier, or becoming organ donors.\n\nIn the market\n\nWe see decoy pricing in many areas.\n\nA decade ago behavioral economist Dan Ariely spoke about his fascination with the pricing structure of The Economist and how he tested the options on 100 of his students.\n\nIn one scenario the students had a choice of a web-only subscription or a print-only subscription for twice the price; 68% chose the cheaper web-only option.\n\nThey were given a third option—a web-and-print subscription for the same price as the print-only option. Now just 16% chose the cheaper option, with 84% opting for the obviously better combined option.\n\nIn this second scenario the print-only option had become the decoy and the combined option the target. Even The Economist was intrigued by Ariely’s finding, publishing a story about it entitled “The importance of irrelevant alternatives.”\n\nSubscription pricing for The Australian today replicates this “irrelevant alternative”, though in a slightly different way to the pricing architecture Ariely examined.\n\nWhy would you choose the digital-only subscription when you can get the weekend paper delivered for no extra cost?\n\nIn this instance, the digital-only option is the decoy and the digital+weekend paper option is the target. The intention appears to be to discourage you from choosing the more expensive six-day paper option. Because that option is not necessarily more profitable for the company. What traditionally made print editions profitable, despite the cost of printing and distribution, was the advertising they carried. That’s no longer the case. It makes sense to encourage subscribers to move online.\n\nNot all decoys are so conspicuous. In fact the decoy effect may be extremely effective by being quite subtle.\n\nConsider the price of drinks at a well-known juice bar: a small (350 ml) size costs $6.10; the medium (450 ml) $7.10; and the large (610 ml) $7.50.\n\nWhich would you buy?\n\nIf you’re good at doing maths in your head, or committed enough to use a calculator, you might work out that the medium is slightly better value than the small, and the large better value again.\n\nBut the pricing of the medium option—$1 more than the small but just 40 cents cheaper than the large—is designed to be asymmetrically dominated, steering you to see the biggest drink as the best value for money.\n\nSo have you just made the sensible choice, or been manipulated to spend more on a drink larger than you needed?\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

          "description": "Republicans and Democrats criticized Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, after she tweeted that Republican support for Israel is linked to cash, particularly from the powerful pro-Israel group AIPAC.\n\nIt's all about the Benjamins baby  https://t.co/KatcXJnZLV\n\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 10, 2019\n\nJerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called Omar’s remarks “deeply disappointing and disturbing” and said she “appears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.” Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Omar’s “use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive.’\n\nAt the same time, some Americans rushed to Omar’s defense. “Lobbies influence politics, I don’t think that’s controversial to say,” said Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace. “It’s not anti-Semitic to accurately describe something that is completely obvious about the Israeli lobby,” tweeted Brandon Friedman, a former Obama official who heads a public-relations agency whose clients address national security and defense issues.\n\nIn apologizing today (Feb. 11), Omar stood by her view that lobbyists’ money in general plays too big of a role in American politics.\n\nListening and learning, but standing strong  pic.twitter.com/7TSroSf8h1\n\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\n \n\nPro-Israel funding has increased\n\nPro-Israel groups like AIPAC—the American Israel Public Affairs Committee—have been pouring money into US politics over the past 20 years and their influence in Washington has been scrutinized for nearly as long. However, the amount AIPAC has donated has been dwarfed in recent years by the mega-donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics calls the overall pro-Israel politics lobby one of the most “active and well-financed” groups related to international issues in America: “It’s a highly fractious issue with high stakes and it plays a big role in domestic politics.”\n\nAmid concerns that former president Barack Obama would be less supportive of Israel, donations by pro-Israel political-action committees jumped in 2008, his first year in office.\n\nIn 2018, these groups (including AIPAC) spent about $5 million on direct lobbying efforts beyond campaign contributions; pro-Saudi groups, for a rough contrast, spent $19 million from the beginning of 2017 until October 2018.\n\nOver the past two federal election cycles, pro-Israel groups have given more to Democrats than Republicans:\n\nThe pro-Israel groups represent a spectrum of political positions, though they are united against the “boycott, divestment, and sanction” campaign started in 2005 to protest Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. (A bill moving through Congress would allow state governments to dump contractors that boycott Israel.)\n\nOne of the top pro-Israel DC lobbying groups in recent years has been JStreetPAC, which is dedicated to “a diplomacy-first approach to advancing US interests in the Middle East and promoting peace and security for Israel,” including a “two-state approach” for Israel and Palestine, and continued foreign aid to both. \n\n“There is no doubt that money often plays a major role in our political system,” J Street said in a statement released today about Omar’s comments. “At the same time, elected officials must be extremely aware that tropes about Jewish money and political influence have been used for centuries to target and stigmatize our community.”\n\nAIPAC’s political contributions\n\nAIPAC! https://t.co/UdzaFUEfrh\n\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nThe powerful lobbying group that Omar referenced has been active in the US since the 1960s, foots the bill for dozens of Congress trips to Israel every year, and was a longtime opponent of the Iran nuclear deal the Obama administration crafted. Along with other groups representing Middle East interests, AIPAC has applauded Trump’s withdrawal from the deal and the reimposition of sanctions on Iran.\n\nAIPAC’s political support is seen as so important that every top 2016 US presidential candidate spoke at the group’s annual convention, from Hillary Clinton to Ted Cruz.\n\nBernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate in the 2016 race, appeared by video. In a rare move for a US elected official, he offered some criticism of the Israeli government’s policies in his speech, saying, “When we talk about Israel and Palestinian areas, it is important to understand that today there is a whole lot of suffering among Palestinians and that cannot be ignored.” Peace, he said, would require compromise from “both sides.”\n\nThe Adelsons and Israeli American Council\n\nAIPAC’s lobbying and campaign contributions have been much less than the huge influx of cash into US politics from mega-donors Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who was born in Israel to parents who had emigrated to British-controlled Palestine from Poland in 1930s.\n\nThey were the largest donors in the 2018 midterm elections with $123 million, all of that to Republican political action committees that then funneled millions to incumbents in tough races. Adelson-controlled entities gave $55 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, for example, which spent $126 million running ads against Democrats such as Wisconsin’s Randy”IronStache” Bryche.\n\nThe Adelsons also fund the Israeli American Council (IAC), a group with 20 chapters around the US that Sheldon Adelson described as a hardline alternative to AIPAC in November 2017. IAC will “unequivocally always without question and irreversibly support Israel when it needed it,” he said. “There will be no political correctness. There will be no questions about whether we should keep the door to the White House open to us.”\n\nMiriam, a doctor who runs drug-treatment clinics in Las Vegas and Israel, is believed to be a key influence on Trump’s decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move that most American Jews didn’t support. “Injecting Israeli Jewish sensibilities into the American Jewish body politic is what drives a lot of what the Adelsons fund,” the Times of Israel wrote last year. Sheldon’s casino interests have been advanced by the Trump administration, including lobbying the Japanese government on his behalf for a casino license.\n\nMiriam described how her childhood shaped her views in an interview with Hadassah Magazine in 2014. “I don’t remember any children of my class who were from Europe and had grandparents,” she said. “All were lost in the Holocaust. There was nobody to spoil us. We grew up knowing our existence depended on a strong army and that everyone around us wanted to invade us. It was important just to survive.”\n",

          "description": "It’s only somewhat about the Benjamins. \n \nHouse Republicans don’t have a policy agenda that they’re planning to wield to win back the House from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats, but they do have a new favored wedge issue: Israel. Republicans, led by Rep. Kevin McCarthy, are accusing two new Muslim members of Congress, who’ve made strident criticisms of Israel, of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe specifics of the controversy of the moment (“Omar ignites new anti-Semitism controversy with comments on AIPAC,” according to Politico) relate to some moderately ill-advised tweets Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) fired off Sunday night. But the tweets themselves only arose in the larger context of what was already a push from Republican leaders to label Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) as anti-Semitic over their views on Israel policy. That’s not a novel tactic to anyone familiar with the discourse around this subject, but it’s taken on a new urgency in the current Congress for two parallel reasons. \n\nFirst, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the government of Israel has become increasingly comfortable with the concept of Israel being used as a partisan wedge issue — something Israeli leaders traditionally felt would undermine Israel’s political support in the United States. \n\nSecond, as part of a larger resurgence of left-wing politics in the United States, a minority of Democrats are becoming increasingly comfortable with overt hostility to the Israeli government — and at least some establishment Democrats, stung by Netanyahu’s conduct during President Obama’s eight years in office, are prepared to back them. \n\nNonetheless, the issue of Israel remains deeply — indeed, almost uniquely — divisive in the Democratic Party. After about twelve hours of controversy, Omar’s remarks led to a remarkable joint rebuke from the entire House Democratic leadership team calling them “deeply offensive.”\n\nOmar, in turn, apologized for the phrasing of her tweet while standing behind the substantive criticism of AIPAC’s policy agenda. \n\nListening and learning, but standing strong pic.twitter.com/7TSroSf8h1\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-Israel establishment in the American Jewish community remains determined to flex considerable financial muscle in favor of its preferred policy approach while simultaneously accusing those like Omar who draw attention to this fact of trafficking in anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nIlhan Omar’s Sunday night twitter controversy\n\nIt all began, as so many things do these days, with public figures being Extremely Online during non-working hours. \n\nAfter years of tolerating Iowa Rep. Steve King’s increasingly overt racism, McCarthy took action against him early this year by stripping him of his committee assignments. Then on Sunday, Ron Kampeas of the JTA news service reported that McCarthy was preparing to challenge Democrats to take similar action against Omar and Tlaib, arguing, according to Kampeas, that “statements by freshmen Democrats Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were equal to King’s and ‘more so.’”\n\nIt wasn’t clear from Kampeas’s report which statements he had in mind, but in the larger context of the GOP push for laws that would punish people for boycotting Israel, it seems like he was trying to say that Omar and Tlaib supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement was worthy of punishment. \n\nThat led Glenn Greenwald, a prominent journalist and critic of both Israel and BDS laws, to send a tweet. \n\nGOP Leader Kevin McCarthy threatens punishment for @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib over their criticisms of Israel. It's stunning how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation even if it means attacking free speech rights of Americans https://t.co/It1fGm1b70\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 10, 2019\n\nThen Omar followed up on Greenwald by saying that McCarthy’s approach to this issue was “all about the Benjamins baby” (i.e., motivated by money). \n\nIt's all about the Benjamins baby https://t.co/KatcXJnZLV\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 10, 2019\n\nOffered an opportunity to clarify by Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor for the Forward, Omar instead upped the ante to say clearly that she believes the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel. \n\nAIPAC! https://t.co/UdzaFUEfrh\n— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nThis is a sensitive subject for Jewish Americans with a wide range of views about Israel and US foreign policy, and by responding in this way to McCarthy’s provocations, Omar essentially gave McCarthy the pretext he’d previously lacked to analogize her to King. Omar’s fellow first-term Democrat Rep. Max Rose (D-NY) swiftly slammed her remarks as “deeply hurtful to Jews,” TPM’s Josh Marshall deemed it a “very unfortunate tweet,” and even Chelsea Clinton joined the pile-on, which prompted a whole other series of counterattacks. \n\nLest you think any of this is happening in good faith, recall that McCarthy himself in October was accusing three Jewish Democrats of trying to “buy” the 2018 midterms. \n\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy posted this tweet AFTER a bomb was sent to Soros' house. Up until a couple of minutes ago it was pinned to the top of his profile. pic.twitter.com/FEeKoPolHL\n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 24, 2018\n\nNonetheless, whether or not one takes McCarthy’s complaints seriously, he has correctly identified a potentially explosive issue that is very well-calibrated to the specific goal of getting Democrats to fight with each other about a topic most Americans probably don’t care very much about. \n\nIt’s only partially about the Benjamins\n\nThe notion that congressional support for Israel is literally all about the Benjamins is clearly false, and Omar could have saved herself some grief by acknowledging as much in response to Ungar-Sargon’s initial inquiry. There are, pretty obviously, major questions of ethnic and religious identity in play — not just among American Jews but also with the incredible influence of Christian Zionism in American politics and, conversely, the not-coincidental reality that Omar and Tlaib, who are both Muslim, have strong feelings on this topic.\n\nThat said, while it’s true that to suggest a cabal of Jewish moneymen control Congress from behind the scenes via their perfidious financial influence certainly does traffic in anti-Semitic stereotypes, it’s also clearly true that pro-Israel forces’ financial clout makes a difference in American politics. \n\nDon’t take my word for it — ask AIPAC, which says that “the United States Congress has provided Israel with the strongest support of any institution in the world” and tells its members that “involvement in the political process is a tangible way of showing friends of Israel that you care about who serves in Congress.” It also specifically defines this in terms of being sufficiently generous with your campaign contributions to qualify as a member of AIPAC’s Congressional Club. \n\nBeyond its involvement in encouraging campaign contributions, AIPAC also spends a lot of money on lobbying. \n\nThe $3.5 million AIPAC spent lobbying in 2018 is trivial compared to what business groups spend (the National Association of Realtors took the cake with $543 million in spending and mostly lost the argument over the home mortgage tax deduction anyway), but very large relative to the world of foreign policy. The No. 2 foreign policy donor, UNICEF USA, spent just $744,000, and its activities are orthogonal to AIPAC’s interests anyway. The next-largest group lobbying on Israel, J Street, which advocates a pro-Israel, pro-peace agenda, spent less than 10 percent of AIPAC’s lobbying budget. It actually got outspent by a second, smaller hawkish Israel policy group, the Israeli-American Coalition for Action. \n\nLast but by no means least, AIPAC spends on less formal means of influence-peddling. \n\nTheir annual trips to Israel for members of Congress are perennially the most popular form of foreign congressional travel, in no small part because the accommodations are rather lavish. As Rachael Bade and Amanda Becker have reported, AIPAC spends around $10,000 per guest on business-class airfare and luxury accommodations. Members are allowed to bring spouses and other family guests on the trips, and members frequently go multiple times. Comparable junkets for journalists are also available.\n\nTo view this as the primary driver of a foreign policy relationship that has roots in Cold War strategy and substantial links to evangelical eschatology is mistaken. But there’s also something a little willfully naive about the counter-assertion that money is irrelevant. Haim Saban, a major Democratic Party donor, for example, has in the past described himself as “a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.” That gives many rank-and-file Democrats who don’t particularly care about foreign policy (a good description of most members of Congress) good reason to adopt a pro-Israel line and enjoy the benefits rather than rocking the boat. \n\nRepublicans want a wedge; Omar gave them a sledgehammer\n\nThe larger context for this controversy, however, is not the strength of the pro-Israel lobby but its weakness. The concurrent administrations of Obama in the United States and Netanyahu in Israel led to a serious deterioration of the relationship between Democrats and pro-Israel organizations. \n\nOn a policy level, that was largely about Iran, where Israel stridently opposed Obama’s nuclear deal but congressional Democrats mostly chose partisanship and ideology over AIPAC’s preferences. \n\nOn a political level, that was about Netanyahu’s eagerness to break with precedent and allow Israel to be used as a partisan wedge issue — all but openly campaigning on behalf of Mitt Romney and John Boehner against Obama and congressional Democrats — even while aware that this risked a backlash from Democrats in Congress. \n\nIn the Trump era, the United States has tilted further than ever in a pro-Israel direction (moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem even without a diplomatic agreement with the Palestinians about the status of the city), while Democrats have grown stronger in their criticisms of anti-Iranian activities by Saudi Arabia and the UAE that Israel supports. \n\nBernie Sanders has played a leading role in much of this, continuing a trajectory of shattering taboos that he launched during his 2016 campaign.\n\nBut Sanders, who is Jewish, and whose policy team includes seasoned professionals with years of experience on the issue, manages to make his points in a thoughtful, politically effective way. Omar’s social media strategy, by contrast, is a gift to congressional Republicans who are eager to promote Democratic infighting. And there is now infighting aplenty, with other Democrats rushing to distance themselves from Omar while more left-wing writers and activists emphasize their agreement with the basic point that pro-Israel money matters. \n\nNADLER: “It is deeply disappointing and disturbing to hear Representative Ilhan Omar’s (MN) choice of words in her exchange with a journalist yesterday, wherein she appears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.\"\n— Sam Stein (@samstein) February 11, 2019\n\nFor nearly two weeks, Rep. @IlhanMN has avoided meeting with me to discuss why anti-Semitic tropes like these are hurtful to so many Americans. There is absolutely no place for this rhetoric in Congress -- or anywhere. https://t.co/0arhEAVyXO\n— Rep Josh Gottheimer (@RepJoshG) February 11, 2019\n\naccurately describing how the Israel lobby works is not anti-semitism https://t.co/30M6rVmeJb\n— Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) February 11, 2019\n\nThe fundamental reality, however, is that this is an inherently difficult topic for Democrats. A large majority of Americans say they sympathize more with the Israeli side than the Palestinian side in the conflict, but rank-and-file Democrats are split roughly 50-50. \n\nThat means that in order to be effective, people who want to challenge the pro-Israel consensus in politics need to be careful and strategic with their interventions — the opposite of tossing off inflammatory tweets on a Sunday evening with no strategy lined up.

          "description": "Card members of the Business Platinum® Card from American Express just got two valuable new perks: up to $200 in statement credits for Dell purchases each year and a complimentary year of global WeWork access.\n\nYou can now sign up for the WeWork benefit, and the Dell statement credit went live right at midnight on Feb. 1. That’s when we learned that the $200 benefit is broken into two different semiannual $100 statement credits for making a purchase through Dell.\n\nThere were a lot of yawns when this benefit was announced. After all, most card members probably figured that you’d have to buy a Dell laptop or Dell supplies to use this credit. However, after diving into Dell’s online catalog, I’m finding literally thousands of items for sale through Dell for under $100. These include:\n\n7 docks & stands\n\n319 keyboards & mice\n\n144 batteries, chargers and adapters\n\n318 carrying cases\n\n272 audio\n\n1,090 cables and adapters\n\nThat’s a bunch of options, so let’s highlight some of the items under $100 that might be the most appealing to travelers. Just don’t forget to register for the promotion before you make any of these purchases using your Business Platinum Card.\n\nIn This Post\n\nKensington SecureTrek backpack: $99.99\n\nThere are 130 backpacks available for sale through Dell for under $100. The one that stands out to me as the most logical for travelers is the Kensington SecureTrek. Capable of holding up to a 15.6-inch laptop and a 10-inch tablet in padded sleeves, the backpack is designed with a number of anti-theft measures including a locking base and anti-puncture zippers. And it’s not too heavy, at just 3.11 pounds.\n\nIncase City Backpack: $99.95\n\nImage courtesy of Incase.\n\nFor those carrying bigger laptops, the just-under-$100 Incase City Backpack is designed to hold the 17-inch Apple MacBook Pro. Interestingly, this is being sold for $30 cheaper on Dell than it is on Incase’s own website. The sleek backpack features numerous compartments and sleeves to keep everything in place.\n\nTargus Sport Backpack: $23\n\nIf you’re looking for a cheap day pack instead, consider the Targus Sport Backpack. At just $23, it’s large enough to carry a 15.6-inch laptop while being small enough to be carried on as a personal item — even on restrictive low-cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit. The blue version is marked down to $22.99 while the black and red versions currently cost $27.99 before tax.\n\nLogitech USB Headset H390: $30\n\nAmong the 149 headphones and headsets available for under $100 through Dell, the $29.99 Logitech USB Headset H390 popped out as a practical choice. I’ve found that headsets with a boom mic can be a hands-free neck-saver for long phone calls with airline agents or hourslong holds waiting for a Marriott agent. It’s a wired headset with a USB plug, making it most practical for VOIP calls. But, you might be able to use an adapter to connect your phone.\n\nSony MDR-XB650BT headphones: $98\n\nIf you’d rather go wireless, the Sony MDR-XB650BT is currently marked down from $128 to $98. These over-the-ear headphones connect to your phone via NFC or Bluetooth and promise up to 30 hours of battery life. These headphones also have a built-in microphone that also makes it good for making calls. Available in black, blue and red colors.\n\niHome iBT370 portable speaker: $30\n\nI’m such a fan of my Oontz Angle 3 portable speaker that I made it my pick for TPG’s holiday gift guide. Unfortunately no Oontz speakers are available through Dell — although the Angle 3 Plus is available through the TPG Shop. However, there are 154 other speakers available for under $100. In the budget category, there’s the $29.99 iHome iBT370. Weighing just 5 ounces and with a stated battery life of 8 hours, it’s a light choice for taking your music on the road.\n\nBose SoundLink Micro portable speaker: $79\n\nOn the higher end of the speaker scale is the Bose SoundLink Micro — which is currently marked down to $79 from the standard $99 price. The 10-ounce waterproof speaker seems rugged enough for any travel plans you might have.\n\nSony PS-LX300USB turntable: $98\n\nIn case you missed it, vinyl is making a comeback. According to a recent survey, nearly 50% of vinyl record purchases are by those under 35. Whether you’re a young or old vinyl lover, if you need a new turntable, the Sony PS-LX300USB is currently marked down from $128 to $98. Even better, it has a PC connection for digitizing old records.\n\nEPSON Expression Home XP-440 printer: $49\n\nIf you’re looking for a compact all-in-one printer, scanner and copier for use at home, the EPSON Expression Home XP-440 is currently marked down from $99 to $49 through Dell. It’s capable of printing up to 10 pages per minute and scanning up to 1200 x 2400 dpi. And it’s a wireless printer for ease of use through your computer, laptop, tablet or phone.\n\nUrban Factory Lipstick 2,600 mAh battery: $11-13\n\nFor those of us who travel with electronics, you know how critical a backup power bank can be to saving the day. Among the 78 portable charging devices under $100, there’s four “lipstick” power banks available starting at $10.99. Depending on your phone, these are going to be about one cell phone battery worth of charge.\n\nVisionTek 8,000 mAh battery: $27\n\nIf you’re looking for more than just one charge, the VisionTek battery is one of the best options on Dell’s website when it comes to price per capacity. The 8,000 mAh battery costs just $26.99.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot: $50\n\nIt seems everyone already has a smart speaker in their home. But if you don’t — or want to upgrade yours — the 3rd-generation Amazon Echo Dot is available for just $49.99 through Dell in both white and gray colors.\n\nGoogle Home Mini: $49\n\nIf you’re more of a Google fan, you might want to purchase the six-ounce Google Home Mini instead. The Google assistant is available through Dell for just $49 before tax.\n\nMcAfee Total Protection 5 Device: $90\n\nOn the software side, there are 134 options under $100 including a range of photo and video editing tools that travelers may find useful. But, security is paramount — especially when traveling. If you don’t already have a security solution, you can purchase McAfee’s anti-virus, identity and privacy protection “Total Protection” bundle through Dell for $89.99 before tax.\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 Personal 1-Year: $70\n\nAnother practical software option is the single-user license of Microsoft Office 365 Personal for $70 or the 5-user Microsoft Office 365 Home for $100. The bundle includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and 1 TB (per user) of online storage through OneDrive. While it’s not the sexiest option on the list, it could be a real money saver for those that’d have to pay for Microsoft Office another way.\n\nWhat Doesn’t Work\n\nDell gift cards can seem like an easy way of maximizing the statement credit — banking funds for a larger purchase later. Unfortunately, Dell doesn’t sell its own gift cards directly. So, the purchase won’t trigger the statement credit.\n\nMaximizing Your Purchase\n\nBefore you make your purchase, make sure to register for the Dell statement credit. And while you’re on the American Express website, check your Amex Offers to see if your Amex Business Platinum is targeted for an Amex Offer for 10% cash back on Dell purchases:\n\nThe terms of that Amex Offer say that you’ll need to make the purchases through Dell.com/amex. So, you’ll probably want to use this link to make sure that you get 10% cash back. However, if you aren’t targeted — or want to risk giving up the 10% cash back for potentially even more cash back — you can click through a cash-back portal such as TopCashBack which is currently offering 5% back:\n\nThat’s not bad, but as Frequent Miler pointed out recently, Cashback Monitor’s history of Dell cash-back rates shows that 20% back offers come around every six months. If you’re looking to absolutely max out this $100 Dell statement credit offer, it might be worth waiting for an elevated cash-back offer.\n\nImage from Cashback Monitor.\n\nBy stacking these promotions, you can end up getting a free item — after statement credit — plus cash back on top of that. That’s not bad for a new credit card perk that many card members probably weren’t too excited about.\n",

          "description": "American Express has slowly been refreshing its card portfolio, introducing new benefits and increasing earning with cards like the American Express® Gold Card and the American Express® Business Gold Card. Most recently, the card issuer announced changes to the Business Platinum® Card from American Express, adding up to $200 in statement credits toward Dell purchases each year, and a yearlong membership to WeWork. These additional perks come with a higher annual fee: $595, up from $450.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of WeWork, it’s a rapidly growing real estate company that provides flexible office space with amenities, hip decor and events to entrepreneurs and startup companies around the world.\n\nUntil today, we did not know exactly what type of membership card holders would receive other than that WeWork and Amex claimed it was a benefit worth $2,700.\n\nThe lobby of WeWork branch in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Xinhua/Pei Xin via Getty Images)\n\nAmex has shared the details of the benefit, which you can now register for here. Note that this is not an ongoing benefit, and will only be valid for one year after you register.\n\nBusiness Platinum card holders will receive 12 months of WeWork Platinum Global Access. Platinum Global Access is only available to Business Platinum card holders, meaning those without the card will not be able to purchase this type of membership.\n\nWhat exactly do you get with Platinum Global Access? WeWork describes it as such:\n\nPlatinum Global Access includes access to WeWork’s 300+ locations around the world, during local business hours. This includes access to open workspace and premium amenities, including Wi-Fi, phone booths, and refreshments, like coffee, tea, and fruit water. Platinum Global Access members also get a dedicated member support team and invites to exclusive Platinum Global Access-only events.\n\nWhen I started working at TPG in 2016, we were actually based in a WeWork in downtown Manhattan (oh, how things have changed). WeWorks generally have a common area with tables, couches and a kitchen — adjoining these areas are private offices that are rented out by individuals and companies. With Platinum Global Access, you’ll only have access to these common workspaces, not a private office.\n\nThis seems similar to WeWork’s basic “Hot Desk” option that starts at $220 a month — that’s likely where the $2,700 valuation comes in ($220 x 12 = $2,640). Although unlike other memberships, Platinum Global Access grants entry to all locations without any additional fee.\n\nWeWork says that Platinum Global Access will only allow access to WeWork buildings during normal business hours, from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. While common spaces typically close at 6pm, Amex notes that office hours do vary by location so you may be able to spend more time there, especially if you’ve already entered the building. You’ll have access to conference rooms and printing, but you’ll have to purchase credits if you want to use either.\n\nFinally, you can book a hot desk in advance, which can be done in as little as an hour ahead of time. Members can still swipe into a WeWork without advanced notice but there may be times when a location is at capacity, so booking ahead can help guarantee a space to work, an Amex representative told TPG.\n\nWhen to Sign Up\n\nYou can sign up for the benefit here, and although the official launch date isn’t until Feb. 15, Amex confirmed with us that you can start using the offer immediately. Once enrolled, you’ll receive a welcome email from WeWork (two to three business days after signing up) which will notify you that you can start booking space at one of WeWork’s 425 locations around the globe.\n\nOnly primary card holders are eligible for the benefit, so any authorized users won’t be able to get a membership of their own.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is when to enroll. You’ll have to sign up by Dec. 31, 2019 — after that the benefit will no longer be available — but your yearlong membership will begin on whatever date you enroll. It may make sense to wait to sign up until you know when you’re actually going to start using WeWork.\n\nFor more on the Business Platinum Card from American Express, see:\n\nCredit Card Review: The Business Platinum Card From American Express\n\nAmex Business Platinum Now Offers WeWork Access and Has a Higher Fee\n\nFeatured image courtesy of WeWork.\n",

          "description": "Beth Skwarecki has written the perfect Lifehacker post with the perfect headline (so perfect I had to use it for my aggregation headline too, which I try to never do):\n\nWhen you’re new to a sport, you don’t yet know what specialized features you will really care about. You probably don’t know whether you’ll stick with your new endeavor long enough to make an expensive purchase worth it. And when you’re a beginner, it’s not like beginner level equipment is going to hold you back…\n\nHow cheap is too cheap?\n\nFind out what is totally useless, and never worth your time. Garage sale ice skates with ankles that are so soft they flop over? Pass them up.\n\nWhat do most people do when starting out?\n\nIf you’re getting into powerlifting and you don’t have a belt and shoes, you can still lift with no belt and no shoes, or with the old pair of Chucks that you may already have in your closet. Ask people about what they wore when they were starting out, and it’s often one of those options…\n\nWhat’s your exit plan?\n\nHow will you decide when you’re done with your beginner equipment? Some things will wear out: Running shoes will feel flat and deflated. Some things may still be usable, but you’ll discover their limitations. Ask experienced people what the fancier gear can do that yours can’t, and you’ll get a sense of when to upgrade. (You may also be able to sell still-good gear to another beginner to recoup some of your costs.)\n\nWearing out your beginner gear is like graduating. You know that you’ve stuck with the sport long enough that you aren’t truly a beginner anymore. You may have managed to save up some cash for the next step. And you can buy the nicer gear now, knowing exactly what you want and need.\n\nThis is 100 percent the truth, and applies to way more than just sports equipment. Computers, cooking, fashion, cars, furniture, you name it. The key thing is to pick your spots, figure out where you actually know what you want and what you want to do with it, and optimize for those. Everywhere else? Don’t outwit yourself. Play it like the beginner that you are. And save some scratch in the process. Perfect, perfect advice.\n\nTags: computing   cooking   Lifehacker   sports",

          "description": "Champion of cheap\n \nWhen I wrote about TCL’s sensational new $15 earbuds last month, I didn’t think I’d be singing the praises of a product that’s even cheaper so soon after. But here I am, marveling at the sight and sound of another pair of Chinese earphones, this time from a company I’d never previously heard of called Yincrow. A friend pointed me in the direction of the Yincrow X6, urging that I try their unfathomable performance for a sub-$10 price.\n\nIt’s going to be hard for me to write about these without making it seem like an advertisement, but seriously, the £6.91 ($9.03) that I paid for a pair of the X6s would be a reasonable price just for their shipping from China to the UK. I can’t pretend to understand the economics of running a profitable business at such pricing. One hint might be that the X6 design appears to be identical to that of the celebrated Venture Electronics Monk buds that are on sale at Massdrop for, um, $4.99. Someone, somewhere along the production chain, spent money on research and development for these earphones, but I have my doubts that it’s the companies selling the final products at such unbelievable prices.\n\nBut enough talk about the provenance of cheap gadgets. Let’s talk about why the Yincrow X6 are impressive. First and foremost, their sound belies any prejudice you might have about their design (which seems to have come straight out of the ‘90s, replete with a soft foam cover that you pull over their plastic casing). The bass that comes out of these earphones is full, powerful, taut, and richly satisfying. Put on Lorn’s The Maze to Nowhere, and try not to smile at the throbbing, rumbling, and menacing rendering that the X6s provide. Vocals aren’t overwhelmed by the pronounced bass bump of these earbuds, either, as Halsey’s Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, The Knife’s Silent Shout, and Kaytranada’s 99.9% demonstrate. The only things missing from the sound are the things I don’t want: distortion and a hot treble response. This is friendly, enjoyable sound.\n\nMy favorite budget earphones to date have been the Zero Audio Carbo Tenore, but at their price of $38 or so, they cost four times as much as a pair of X6s. I still prefer the Carbo Tenores for their more refined sound and better isolation of external noises, but the X6s aren’t far behind.\n\nThe Yincrow X6s are worn in the classic earbud style of sitting just outside your ear canal. They’re similar to a pair of Apple’s EarPods or AirPods in their light weight and undemanding fit — except they sound substantially better. As a fan of the AirPods, I don’t say this lightly. The X6s’ meatier bass response and marginally better sound isolation make them more pleasing and more practical to listen to than the AirPods.\n\nThere’s no microphone to be found on the Yincrow X6, and the wire’s connection to the earbuds has no strain relief to protect it from accidental tugs. Without wishing to encourage careless consumerism, I think the price is so low that I’d buy a fresh pair if one of these breaks. And anyone categorically in need of a built-in mic might want to check out the aforementioned Monk earphones, which include upgraded cable options.\n\nWired earphones have been growing more interesting over the past few months with the rollout of the first affordable USB-C buds like the OnePlus UBS-C Bullets, but evidently, even the old-school analog ones are capable of surprising and surpassing expectations. Growing pressure from wireless competitors is likely to push prices of wired earphones down, though I doubt Yincrow has any further to go. What the company has done with the X6 is already an exceptional outlier on the price-to-performance curve. If you still have devices with a headphone jack or a dongle you don’t hate, you really should own a pair.\n\nPhotography by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

          "description": "Start Black History Month by giving it a read.\n \nGoogle is kicking off Black History Month this year by celebrating the legacy of Sojourner Truth, the subject of today’s Google Doodle. Which means that it’s time to reread one of the great works of American rhetoric: Truth’s “Ain’t I a Woman” speech. \n\nSojourner Truth was born into slavery at the end of the 18th century, but she escaped — carrying her infant daughter with her — in 1826. (“I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right,” she would later say.) When the son she left behind was sold illegally, she successfully sued for his freedom as well. Naming herself “Sojourner Truth,” she converted to Methodism and began campaigning for women’s rights and the abolition of slavery.\n\nShe improvised her “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention in Akron. The exact wording of the speech has been contested. In contemporary transcriptions, the famous question “ain’t I a woman?” doesn’t appear anywhere, and some historians have argued that native New Yorker Truth is unlikely to have spoken in the Southern-inflected English that tinges the most widely reproduced version of the speech.\n\nBut regardless of Truth’s precise wording, the message at the core of “Ain’t I a Woman” rings powerfully true 168 years later: that women can change the world, and that Truth’s blackness did not make her not a woman. That’s the kind of intersectionality that Truth was immensely skilled at navigating, despite the enormous pressure on women of color at the time to choose between the women’s movement and the abolitionist movement. Truth never chose. As she pointed out in her speech, she shouldn’t have to.\n\nHere’s the speech in full:\n\nWell, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that ‘twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what’s all this here talking about?\n\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain’t I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain’t I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?\n\nThen they talk about this thing in the head; what’s this they call it? [member of audience whispers, “intellect”] That’s it, honey. What’s that got to do with women’s rights or negroes’ rights? If my cup won’t hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn’t you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?\n\nThen that little man in black there, he says women can’t have as much rights as men, ‘cause Christ wasn’t a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.\n\nIf the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back , and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.\n\nObliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain’t got nothing more to say. \n",

          "description": "In his new book, Christie accuses Kushner of exacting a revenge plot over a decade-long family feud.\n\nOne of the strangest — and most consequential — feuds in Donald Trump’s orbit has long been the enmity between presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. And now it’s back in the news because Christie has aired his grievances in a new book.\n\nChristie is currently making the rounds promoting Let Me Finish, a memoir recounting his upbringing, political rise, and time spent in — and out of — President Trump’s inner circle. Christie has made clear in the book, and on his press tour promoting it, that he still has a bone to pick with Kushner and his entire family over a clash that began more than a decade ago.\n\nIn 2004, Christie, then the US attorney for New Jersey, investigated the Kushner family patriarch Charles. The tale that ensued is a salacious one that involves illegal campaign contributions, videotapes, and a sex worker. Christie’s prosecution culminated in a prison sentence for Charles Kushner.\n\nA decade later, Christie became a prominent supporter of Trump’s presidential candidacy, and Trump named him to lead transition planning. But just after the election, Christie claims, Jared Kushner engineered Christie’s ouster.\n\nNow, in the book, Christie is trying to settle scores. One chapter is titled “Jared’s Meltdown,” and elsewhere he accuses Kushner of orchestrating a political “hit job” against him.\n\nChris Christie’s Charles Kushner prosecution, briefly explained\n\nCharles Kushner was (and still is) a prominent New Jersey real estate developer who built Kushner Companies, a billion-dollar real estate empire. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was also a big name in the state’s Democratic Party politics as a prominent donor and ally to Jim McGreevey, who served as governor of the state from 2002 to 2004. McGreevey named Kushner as commissioner for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but Kushner resigned from the post in 2003 when questions about his political donations started to percolate.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a feud erupted between Charles Kushner and his siblings, Murray Kushner and Esther Schulder, and his brother-in-law, Bill Schulder. And this feud had serious legal implications.\n\nMurray filed a lawsuit accusing Charles of diverting money from their businesses to political candidates, among other misdeeds. Then an accountant turned whistleblower filed a subsequent lawsuit saying he was fired when he provided evidence that Murray’s allegations were true.\n\nSo then-US Attorney Chris Christie began investigating the matter. As New York magazine reported, Charles Kushner’s allies viewed the probe as political — maintaining that Christie, an ambitious Republican appointee, was using a pretext to go after a top Democratic donor. And Charles blamed his relatives.\n\nSo in an attempt to retaliate against the family members he believed were out to get him, Charles arranged for a sex worker to be paid $10,000 to seduce his brother-in-law Bill and secretly taped the encounter. He then sent the tape and photographs to his sister Esther, Bill’s wife. (He also tried to pay a sex worker to seduce the accountant, but the accountant turned the woman down.)\n\nChristie writes about meeting with the Schulders regarding the incident and claims Esther Schulder expressed confidence her brother had been behind it. Christie says she told him that “Charlie plays on people’s weaknesses” and that her husband “had a weakness.” Investigators were eventually able to link Charles to the tapes.\n\nCharles Kushner was arrested; in 2005, he pleaded guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering, and making illegal campaign donations. He was sentenced to 18 to 24 months in prison. (Christie had pushed for a stiffer sentence because he said Kushner failed to demonstrate “acceptance of responsibility” for what he had done.) Charles served 14 months in a federal prison in Alabama and served out the rest of his sentence in a halfway house in New Jersey.\n\nAfter his release, Charles went right back to work. But the ordeal was a formative experience for his son, Jared. In a 2009 interview with New York magazine’s Gabe Sherman, it was clear he hadn’t let go of what happened and sees his father as a victim:\n\n“His siblings stole every piece of paper from his office, and they took it to the government,” Jared maintained. “Siblings that he literally made wealthy for doing nothing. He gave them interests in the business for nothing. All he did was put the tape together and send it. Was it the right thing to do? At the end of the day, it was a function of saying ‘You’re trying to make my life miserable? Well, I’m doing the same.’”\n\nIndeed, Kushner advocated for the criminal justice bill passed by Congress last year and said his interest in the matter stems from his father’s experience.\n\nJared Kushner allegedly brought his Chris Christie hate to the Trump campaign and the White House\n\nIn the ensuing years, Christie became governor of New Jersey and a rising star in Republican politics, and Jared Kushner married Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka. So as Trump ran for president in 2016, their paths crossed.\n\nKushner had a top role on Trump’s campaign. Then after Christie himself dropped out of the race, he became one of Trump’s most prominent early endorsers and surrogates. And in the spring of 2016, the campaign tapped him to begin planning for a potential transition should Trump win the election.\n\nChristie writes in his book that Kushner had a “meltdown” when he heard this news. He writes that Kushner tried to keep Trump from bringing him on. Subsequently, he writes, the pair agreed to put the past behind them — but the president’s son-in-law kept working against him behind the scenes. Christie writes that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort told him Kushner tried to push him out of the transition as well.\n\nEventually, Kushner’s efforts were successful: Christie was fired from the Trump transition team just a few days after the election. According to Christie’s book, Steve Bannon told him “the kid” — as in, Jared — was the reason he was forced out:\n\n“The kid’s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,” he blurted out. “It’s been constant. He never stops. Ancient bitterness, I guess.”\n\nChristie wrote that Kushner, “apparently seething over events that occurred a decade ago, was exacting a plot of revenge against me, a hit job that made no sense at all for the man we had just helped elect.”\n\nBut as for the stuff with Jared’s father, Christie has no regrets.\n\n“If a guy hires a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law and then videotapes it and then sends the videotape to his sister to attempt to intimidate her from testifying before a grand jury, do I really need any more justification than that?” Christie said in a recent interview with PBS. “I mean, it’s one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was US attorney.”\n\n\"It's one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted...and I was the U.S. attorney in New Jersey.\"@ChrisChristie talks about prosecuting Charles Kushner for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering. #FiringLineShowPBS pic.twitter.com/rBNn0j0bCY\n\n— Firing Line with Margaret Hoover (@FiringLineShow) January 29, 2019\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Christie also issued a warning about Kushner’s power in the White House. “There is simply no one more influential in the White House on the president than Jared Kushner,” he said. “He’s not the only person who he listens to, but I don’t think anyone has more influence than Jared has.”\n\nThe news moves fast.

          "description": "The modern company can work with Amazon, or work against it.\n\nIgnoring Amazon.com Inc. is no longer a viable option. The company—if company is even an adequate word to describe it—touches e-commerce, logistics, manufacturing, grocery, customer service, cloud services, hardware, robotics, artificial intelligence, the auto industry, the finance industry, real estate, health care, and fashion, among other things. The corners of the economy that Amazon has yet to reach get fewer and farther between every day.\n\nAmazon’s breadth and influence is evident not only in its recently acquired position as world’s most valuable company, or the unprecedented personal fortune of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos (assuming his pending divorce leaves enough of it intact). It’s also apparent in just how frequently other companies wind up discussing, well, Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, executives of public companies worldwide mentioned “Amazon” in more than 2,300 calls and conference presentations, according to a Quartz analysis of transcript data from research firm Sentieo. That was slightly less than the 2,402 conversations that “Amazon” cropped up in during 2017, and far more than the nearly 1,600 transcripts the company’s name graced in 2016. Those counts exclude mentions of “Amazon” by Amazon itself.\n\n“Amazon” comes up in different contexts. Sometimes it’s a company praising Amazon as a business partner. (Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block this past November: “Amazon is a great company, they’re a super partner of ours.”) Other times it’s a boast of stacking up favorably against one of Amazon’s offerings. (Oracle’s Larry Ellison in October: “Our cloud is as easy to use as Amazon, and we have ambitions to be better.”)\n\nWhether Amazon is bad for competition is a matter for lawyers and regulators to decide. But the sheer volume of “Amazon” mentions by companies across industries and around the globe leaves little doubt of how powerful and pervasive Amazon is. Every company on some level fears an onslaught from the so-called Everything Store. Amazon’s ruthless efficiency, willingness to scrape by on thin margins, and unmitigated ambition make it the ultimate competitor.\n\n“There’s not a company in the world that shouldn’t be worried about Amazon on some level,” Robert Perdue, chief operating officer of digital ad firm The Trade DeskPerdue, said at a technology conference in September. “You can put up almost every industry sector, and some part of that sector Amazon is competing with at this point.”\n\nA bitter pill\n\nOne of the most notable industries to experience a spike in Amazon chatter over the last 18 months was health care.\n\nAmazon popped up on the health-care sector’s radar in 2017 for its rumored interest in pharmacy and drug distribution. Health-care executives were forced to address the Amazon factor so often that mentions of “Amazon” eclipsed mentions of “emergency room” in both the third and fourth quarters of that year. ”Amazon could be both a competitor in some areas and a collaborator in others,” Susan DeVore, president and CEO of health-care services provider Premier, said on an earnings call in November 2017. That December, CVS Health said it would merge with health insurer Aetna, a decision widely interpreted as a hedge against Amazon.\n\nAmazon’s rumored interest in pharmacy was substantiated in June 2018 when it bought PillPack, a prescription-management startup, for a reported $1 billion. The acquisition instantly shaved $23.5 billion off the market capitalization of the biggest 10 health-care companies.\n\nAnother shock to health care arrived earlier that year, in January, when Amazon, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase announced a joint plan to tackle health care. The companies said they would create a new venture, “free from profit-making incentives and constraints,” to reduce health care costs and improve satisfaction for their US employees. The market values of health insurance and pharmacy stocks dropped by billions of dollars. And in the first quarter of 2018, health-care companies mentioned Amazon on 54 separate calls and conferences, an all-time high.\n\nFrom online to offline\n\nAmazon buying Whole Foods was a game-changer in grocery but also in real estate.\n\nThe $13.7 billion purchase was a clear sign that Amazon, a company known for its prowess online, intended to develop a physical presence. If Amazon was doing it, other e-commerce companies were sure to follow. All of that was good news for property managers and developers, and in late 2017, real-estate executives mentioned “Amazon” almost as often as “landlord.”\n\n“As demonstrated by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods … online retailers demonstrated a need for physical space for a variety of reasons,” SmartREIT CEO Huw Thomas said in November 2017.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, Amazon leased 240 million square feet of space for offices, physical stores, fulfillment and data centers, and unspecified other uses. That included leases for 465 Whole Foods stores in North America and seven internationally that Amazon gained with its June purchase of Whole Foods. As of Dec. 31, Amazon also owned 14 million square feet, most of which was used for Amazon Web Services or its international operations.\n\nThat number almost certainly rose in 2018, with Amazon’s lease of the 400,000-square-foot Expedia tower in Seattle, the expansion of its Amazon Go automated convenience stores, and its planned lease of 1 million square feet of office space in Long Island City.\n\n“We really see brick-and-mortar retail becoming relevant again,” Michael Landy, CEO of Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, said on an earnings call in November 2018. “You see Amazon owning Whole Foods, Amazon Go. They’re investing at brick-and-mortar retail.” A month earlier, David Jamieson or Kimco Realty Corporation said the Amazon Go expansion demonstrated “high, high demand for great quality real estate on the small shop category.”\n\nThe customer-obsession pays off\n\nConsumer discretionary companies, which sell goods and services considered “non-essential” to consumers, are obvious competitors of Amazon.com. The sector includes Ebay, Gap, Hasbro, Macy’s, Nike, Starbucks, and Amazon itself. Amazon is the behemoth that can’t be ignored.\n\nSince 2016, mentions of “Amazon” by executives from this sector on calls and at conferences have soared. Many of these references come from companies describing how they have integrated their products and services into Amazon’s platform. “Our brand and select products are now accessible through our Harley-Davidson branded Amazon storefront,” Matthew Levatich, CEO of the motorcycle maker, said on an October 2018 call. “Amazon offers unrivaled access to hundreds of millions of potential new customers.”\n\nSuch partnerships can be seen as a deal with the devil. Nike, for example, partnered with Amazon in June 2017 to sell products directly through its website after years of resistance. The deal gave Nike access to Amazon’s estimated 80 million US Prime members. Nike also got Amazon to commit to closer monitoring of third-party merchants selling Nike wares without permission, or even sometimes Nike counterfeits. But selling on Amazon also risked diluting Nike’s premium brand, especially if Amazon pressured it into uncharacteristic price cuts.\n\nThe rise in consumer discretionary firms talking about Amazon is particularly stark compared to mentions of “Walmart” (or “Wal-Mart”), which if anything has been discussed less in recent years.\n\n“Amazon faces intense competition every day in every business we operate, from retail to entertainment to consumer electronics to technology,” an Amazon spokesman said in an emailed statement. “Retail is our largest business and it’s still less than 1% of global retail.”\n\nOne new reason consumer companies are eyeing Amazon is the company’s push into private- and exclusive-label brands. These labels are either owned by Amazon or made by another company or manufacturer and sold exclusively on Amazon’s site. These brands compete directly with name brands and house labels sold by traditional retailers, like Target’s Up&Up or Walmart’s Great Value. For the manufacturer, fashioning an exclusive brand for Amazon can be an alternative to being subsumed outright.\n\n“Amazon for a number of years had asked us to consider selling them the Carter’s brand,” Richard Westenberger, CEO of $3.7 billion baby and children’s clothing company Carter’s, said at a retail conference this past September. “For a number of reasons, we didn’t know if that made sense. So we shared that experience with Amazon and last year we launched a brand called ‘Simple Joys,’ made exclusively for Amazon Prime customers by Carter’s.” Simple Joys, Westenberger continued, was “by far the most successful” of the four brands Carter’s sold with Amazon. “Amazon uses it as their private label brand and because of that, they put more energy behind it, more marketing dollars,” he said. “It’s been a very, very good relationship.”\n",

          "description": "Earning American Airlines miles is a big part of my miles and points strategy.  While I have a few paid flights a year, most of the American Airlines miles I’ve earned have come from credit card welcome bonuses and spending – for example:\n\nCitiBusiness® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Mastercard® – (I have this in my wallet now, it’s got the highest current bonus of any American Airlines card)\n\nCiti® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® – (A solid choice for perks like a free first checked bag on domestic flights and preferred boarding)\n\nCiti® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® – (Great for frequent American Airlines flyers because it comes with Admirals Club airport lounge access)\n\nThanks to these cards and others, I’ve accumulated hundreds of thousands of American Airlines miles over the years.  But would you believe I almost never redeem them for American Airlines award flights?\n\nWait, That’s NOT American Airlines! But This Incredible Lie-Flat Business Class Seat My Son Enjoyed Came Courtesy of American Airlines Miles\n\nThat’s not to say I never book American Airlines award flights – I do, but I don’t use American Airlines miles (more on that later).  For me, when it comes to redeeming American Airlines miles, partner award flights are the way to go.\n\nAvoid Frustration and Get Huge Value:  Redeem American Airlines Miles for Partner Airline Flights Instead\n\nRead our Ultimate Guide to American Airlines Miles \n\nRead about All the Ways to Earn American Airlines Miles\n\nAmerican Airlines can be pretty stingy about offering low-level award seats, particularly in Business Class.  If your travel dates aren’t flexible or you’re traveling at peak times to popular destinations, you might find your options limited for American Airlines award flights.\n\nI’ve had much better luck using American Airlines miles for award flights on partner airlines.  Because they’re part of the oneworld alliance, you can redeem American Airlines miles for flights on airlines like Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, LATAM, and Iberia.  Or book non-alliance partner flights like Etihad, Alaska Airlines, or Air Tahiti Nui.\n\nWe Crossed the Pacific in Japan Airlines’ Amazing Business Class by Redeeming American Airlines Miles – and Saved Thousands of Dollars\n\nIt might seem strange to collect American Airlines miles if you don’t plan to use them for American Airlines flights.  It actually makes a lot of sense, because you’ve got a ton of options with partner airlines where award seats are sometimes easier to find.  You can often get outsized value when you redeem miles this way – especially on international Business and First Class flights.\n\nFor example, in the past few years, I’ve redeemed American Airlines miles for:\n\n4 round-trip Business Class tickets between Manila and New York (via Tokyo) on Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific – I saved over $18,000 by redeeming American Airlines miles and we even got to spend ~23 hours in Tokyo\n\n2 one-way Business Class tickets between Toronto and Berlin (via Helsinki) on Finnair and Air Berlin (no longer in existence) – We even squeezed in an overnight layover in Helsinki – such a charming city!\n\n2 one-way Business Class tickets between Honolulu and the US mainland on Hawaiian Airlines – Unfortunately, it’s no longer possible to book Hawaiian Airlines awards between the continental US and Hawaii with American Airlines miles, but you can still redeem for inter-island flights\n\nA round-trip coach ticket between New York and Berlin on Air Berlin (again, RIP) – This was extra cheap because it was during the off-peak season\n\nThe Smoked Salmon Appetizer in Finnair Business Class Was Very Civilized!\n\nAll told, I’ve probably saved close to $40,000 just by redeeming American Airlines miles on partner flights.  That’s why I’ll continue to earn (and redeem) American Airlines miles.\n\nWait, What About American Airlines Flights?\n\nI mentioned I’ve booked award flights on American Airlines with other airline miles.  For short-haul flights within North America, I prefer using British Airways Avios points (also a oneworld partner) because of their distance-based award chart.  Flights 1,151 miles or less on these routes cost just 7,500 British Airways Avios points one-way in coach.\n\nWhile American Airlines has the same pricing on very short flights, it’s only valid on routes that are 500 miles or less in distance, which really limits your choices.  Plus, British Airways doesn’t add close-in booking fees like American Airlines does, so redeeming Avios points is ideal for last-minute getaways or emergency travel.\n\nUsing 7,500 British Airways Avios Points Instead of 12,500 American Airlines Miles on Shorter Flights Is a Better Deal\n\nThe great thing about British Airways Avios points is they’re super easy to earn, because British Airways is a Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, and Marriott transfer partner.  So if I ever need more points, I just move them over from my Chase Sapphire Preferred Card or Ink Business Preferred Credit Card.\n\nThen I can save my American Airlines miles for more partner trips.  I’m currently stocking up for (hopefully) another epic trip to Asia in a year or two.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt might sound odd, but I very rarely redeem American Airlines miles for flights on on American Airlines.  Instead, I use them to book partner award flights on airlines like Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Finnair for incredible value.  And it’s often easier to find seats on partner airlines because American Airlines award flights can be hard to find if you’re not flexible with your travel dates.\n\nAll told, I’ve probably saved ~$40,000 on amazing flights to Europe, Hawaii, and Asia by booking this way.  And when I need a short American Airlines flight within the continental US, I use British Airways Avios points instead.  They’re easier to earn (I just transfer points from my Chase Sapphire Preferred and Ink Business Preferred) and many short-haul flights are cheaper compared to booking with American Airlines miles.\n\nYou can earn American Airlines miles quickly with cards like:\n\nCitiBusiness® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Mastercard®\n\nCiti® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard®\n\nCiti® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard®\n\nI’d love to hear your strategy for redeeming American Airlines miles.  Do you get more value on partner flights, or have you had luck using them for American Airlines flights?\n",

          "description": "Last year, the slowdown that China had staved off for years finally hit—just as Donald Trump began pummeling the country with tariffs. Beijing and the White House are now negotiating a trade war truce. What’s remarkable, though, is that China hasn’t yet cried uncle and reversed the practices Trump condemns—most notably, its industrial policies that support domestic companies.\n\nThough there are some reports that China will put on hold its Made in China 2025 program (paywall), one of Trump’s biggest bugbears, moves to scrap its industrial policies are likely to be limited to symbolism. Here’s one illustration of why.\n\nThis chart comes from a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that recalculates how much US consumers really spend on imports once you subtract the dollars spent locally to sell the good—for instance, the cost of trucking, rent, and workers’ wages.\n\nIf you look at the headline data, in 2017, about 11% of what American households spent went toward imported goods. But that “Made in China” or “Made in Mexico” label is deceptive. Only some of the final price that American consumers pay goes to the country where the good is actually made. A fair chunk gets pocketed by US companies and workers.\n\nFor instance, the authors cite a 2014 study that found that an Asian factory that assembles a $100 pair of Nike sneakers earns only around $25. The container shipping company pockets $3.50, while Nike collects $22 for licensing and other intellectual property. And a whopping $50 goes to the US retailer, defraying costs of rent, insurance, trucking, warehousing, and the wages of salespeople.\n\nThe proportions in the Nike analogy aren’t representative. Overall, it turns out that for every $7 US consumers spent on imported goods, about $3 stayed in America, according to the analysis. But that breakdown varies a lot by country. As you can see in the chart above, nearly 62% of the value of Japanese goods went back overseas (presumably, mostly back to Japan). That compares with only 44% for goods made in China.\n\nIn other words, Chinese companies are losing out on a much higher share of sales than Japanese firms are. To close this gap, China needs to make goods of higher value, competing on quality rather than on the low-margin, labor-intensive mass production work that powered its growth in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nWhether Chinese people’s living standards continue to improve depends heavily on this process of “moving up the value chain.” In turn, to pull this shift off, China must boost its skills base, build well-managed firms, and pioneer in new technologies. Its industrial policies channel resources toward doing all that. Which means that to get China to ditch said policies, Trump will probably have to wage a much uglier trade war than anything we’ve seen yet.\n",

          "description": "Having kids sometimes feels like running a race you can’t win against a clock you didn’t set. Parenting today is often characterized by feeling overwhelmed and dissatisfied, two feelings that are exacerbated by headlines like “How Having Children Robs Parents of Happiness” and books with titles like All Joy and No Fun. Yes, you love your children, but you’re not alone if you sometimes hate being their parent.\n\nBut for some parents, that feeling is more than a passing mood. Instead, it’s a part of full-on parental burnout, a state that shares many of the same traits as professional burnout: high levels of exhaustion, feelings of inadequacy, and emotional detachment. Unlike a job that’s causing burnout, though, parenting isn’t something that can be quit.\n\nAlso unlike job-related burnout, parental burnout has relatively little to do with external situational pressures on parents and much more to do with the characteristics of parents themselves. And perhaps surprisingly, that’s good news.\n\nIn the study first identifying the concept of parental burnout, published last year, “we expected burnout to be mainly explained by socio-demographic factors,” like a parent’s economic resources, the number of kids, and the presence or lack of a partner, says psychology researcher Moïra Mikolajczak, a professor at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and one of the study’s co-authors.\n\nWhile those situational elements did contribute to a parent’s chances of developing burnout, Mikolajczak and her colleagues found that personal traits accounted for more of the risk. In an irony it might take a parent to fully appreciate, parents “who looked forward to parenthood the most, who give it their all,” were significantly more at risk of burning out, she says. Other traits linked to burnout included an inconsistent parenting style, a history of attachment difficulties with their own parents, a high level of family disorganization, and a hard time asking for help.\n\nYes, you love your children, but you’re not alone if you sometimes hate being their parent.\n\nOverall, that discovery delighted the researchers. “We nearly jumped out of our chairs with joy at these results, because this meant we could really help these parents,” Mikolajczak says. “External factors are more difficult to change. These we could improve.”\n\nParents who feel on the edge of burnout can use the findings to help themselves. If the flames seem to be getting particularly close, consider these strategies for giving yourself a mental and emotional refresh.\n\nBreak down what’s consuming your time\n\nMikolajczak and her colleagues were surprised to find that burnout was more strongly associated with highly educated parents, who may be more likely to have extraordinarily high expectations of themselves and their children. “So many parents really want to raise their child perfectly,” Mikolajczak says. “They want their children to eat organic food and to have two to three extracurricular activities, and it just becomes too much, and they lose sight of what’s important.”\n\nMikolajczak recommends that parents who are feeling that pressure to be perfect instead step back and look at what a week is really composed of. How much driving are you doing? How much time do you spend preparing complex meals? How much time doing things you think are “good for” your child but that you do not enjoy? “Try to remove some things to allow you and your child time to just be happy together,” she says. “Be aware that such a demanding schedule”—not to mention such a demanding parent—“may be putting your child at greater risk for burnout as well.”\n\nFigure out where you could most use help\n\n“Parental burnout happens when your perceived burden exceeds your personal resources to cope with it,” says clinical psychologist Laura Markham, author of the book Peaceful Parents, Happy Kids. Before you reach that point, try to find your personal “last straw.” It might be driving at one particular time of day, or meal prep, or bath time. Whatever it is, the effort of that activity exceeds what you have to give, and it’s time to ask for help if you can’t omit it entirely.\n\nIf you find yourself resisting, recognize your avoidance as a symptom of burnout. Parents dealing with burnout often struggle to identify problem areas or delegate the tasks that have become too much, says Isabelle Roskam, one of Mikolajczak’s co-authors and a fellow psychology researcher at the Université Catholique. “There’s often a fear that anything someone else does won’t be done as well.”\n\nParents may also ask for help around an area “in ways that are counterproductive,” Mikolajczak says. They accuse (“You’re never there when I need you.” “You always dump this on me.”) or they hint without asking. Make sure you’re being clear and straightforward about what you need.\n\nPay attention to how you handle conflict\n\nA common academic measure of parental happiness or satisfaction is efficacy—in layman’s terms, feeling like you’re pretty good at this parenting thing. Conversely, parents who feel ineffective in their roles are more likely to burn out. Mikolajczak and Roskam found three elements of less effective parenting in the parents they studied: inconsistency, coercion, and escalation.\n\n“In positive parenting, the parent has a consistent role, and the child knows what the limits are across various contexts,” Roskam explains. When a parent is inconsistent, the child learns to repeat requests, whine, and constantly push against the rules. Parents practicing coercion shout, punish, and threaten, and the conflicts escalate as both parent and child try to have the last victory in a game neither can win.\n\n“There’s often a fear that anything someone else does won’t be done as well.”\n\nParents who feel effective in their parenting, by contrast, tend to prioritize connection over control and see discipline not as the moment of punishing a child for wrongdoing, but as a continuum of teaching a child how to be a contributing member of the larger world. They know that there isn’t one universal way to raise a kid and are comfortable responding in the moment, even if they don’t get it exactly right every time.\n\nRecognize your choices\n\nYou are not the powerless victim of your child’s schedule. “We see these images of other people’s lives that are not accurate or sustainable,” Markham says, and then we make decisions in response to those images—which are often of families on the go rather than, say, parents at home watching Netflix while their children learn to entertain themselves (and complain of boredom or squabble with their siblings while doing it).\n\nIf your weekend is stuffed with children’s activities and wraps up with a family holiday party and a long drive home with overstimulated kids, you have made choices that landed you there. You have two paths forward: Either reduce the demands you’ve placed on yourself, or welcome them as things you want to be doing, not things you were forced to do.\n\nShift your focus away from outcomes\n\nWhen it comes to parenting-related stress, Markham says, “our perception matters.” When we require a particular result from our day, our child’s performance, or even our family’s response to a meal, our stress levels increase—and worse, we’ve let our own happiness become dependent on something we don’t control.\n\n“Burnout is an imbalance between demands and rewards,” Markham says. “You can reduce demands, but you can also increase rewards” by choosing to find them in daily connections with your child, rather than in academic or activity successes. Treasure the drive to soccer over the game itself, or “take a few minutes to lie down in the dark with a child at night and listen,” she suggests. “Don’t react to what they say or jump in to fix it. Just visit.”\n\nThis story was originally published on Medium.\n",

          "description": "Tarrant County, home to two million residents in the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, is the last urban enclave in Texas still in GOP hands—just barely. Republicans’ shrinking lead has local party officials quarreling over how to avoid losing it altogether.\n\nOpposing factions will face off tonight (Jan. 10) during a vote to decide whether there’s room in Tarrant’s GOP leadership ranks for a Muslim medical doctor.\n\nSeveral precinct chairs want Shahid Shafi, the party’s vice chairman, to step down, because they see his faith as incompatible with American values and laws. Texas Republicans, including governor Greg Abbott, say efforts to oust Shafi go against the freedom of religion outlined under the US Constitution and call them immoral.\n\nThis kind of internal strife is indicative of the Lone Star State’s shifting politics. After dominating the state for more than two decades, Republicans are now facing some real competition from Democrats profiting from the backlash against Donald Trump and the state’s dramatic demographic changes.\n\nThe question now before Texas Republicans is whether throwing red meat to their staunchest supporters will hurt more than help. At least in Tarrant, the data suggest that strategy would backfire, if not in the next election, probably over the long run.\n\nThe limits of Trump’s xenophobic pitch\n\nThe president has not gone as far as barring Muslim members from his party but has tried to stop Muslim immigrants from coming into the US, and demonized Islam in his speeches.\n\nStoking fears about Muslims has been an effective strategy to rally voters for Trump. Research shows that message resonates deeply with whites who resent ethnic minorities.\n\nTarrant, considerably less white than the country as a whole, is in the process of becoming less so. From 2000 to 2017, the share of people who identified as white only—meaning not Hispanic or mixed race—shrank from 62% to 48%, according to US Census data. (Nationwide, more than 60% of the population checked “white only.”)\n\nAnd the Republicans’ base didn’t prevent candidates in key Texas races for the US House and the state legislature from losing during the 2018 midterms. Victorious Republicans won by unusually thin margins, particularly those who adhere to Trump’s far-right brand of conservatism.\n\nChange in Texas’s growing cities\n\nVoting trends also show that the Republican message is not resonating with urban Texans. Here’s the voting record for the last two presidential and US Senate elections in Texas’s five most populous counties, which anchor the state’s biggest metro areas:\n\nFor now, Tarrant can be considered a swing county at best. That will likely change as its urban areas continue to grow. In 2017, Tarrant was the fifth-fastest growing county in the country, based on number of residents added, and Fort Worth ranked fourth on the list of fastest-growing US cities.\n\nThe winning Republican\n\nTarrant Country is also becoming more diverse. Latinos now make up nearly 30% of the population, up from less than 20% in 2000. Meanwhile, the number of Asians doubled to 120,000, now 6% of the population. Muslims remain an even smaller minority, but their numbers are swelling. Between 2000 and 2010, the county’s practicing Muslim population grew by 180% to about 40,000, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives at Penn State University, which tracks religion membership.\n\nA group of Tarrant County Republicans wants to oust party vice chair Shahid Shafi.\n\nGiven those trends, it’s hard to imagine Texas Republicans holding on to power without attracting non-white leaders—and voters—like Shafi. He was born in India and raised in Pakistan, and later became a surgeon in the US. He’s been a US citizen since 2009. He joined the Republican party because of its small-government mantra, he has told several outlets. Since 2014, he’s been a city councilman in Southlake, a conservative bedroom community outside Fort Worth.\n\n“I believe in this country it matters not where you come from. It only matters where you are going,” he wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the Forth Worth Star Telegram. He declined to speak with Quartz for this story, saying he will address the media after the vote.\n\nDorrie O’Brien, one of the precinct chairs leading the drive to oust Shafi, has essentially argued that he’s not fit for the vice-chairman position based on his religion alone. To her, Islam is a political ideology, she told attendees to a November meeting about the dispute, the newspaper reported. “We do care very much about political Islam with its global jihad to conquer nations and make them islamic and ruled by Shari’a law,” she said. She did not respond to Quartz’s request for comment.\n\nThe fight has dragged on for months, despite numerous attempts to tamp it down by prominent state politicians, including senator Ted Cruz.\n\nDiscrimination against Dr. Shafi b/c he’s Muslim is wrong.

          "description": "Q: Should my resume be one page or two?\n\nDear Upwardly Mobile,\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that you should keep it short: According to job hunting site The Ladders, recruiters spend roughly six seconds reviewing most resumes. However, new findings by resume writing service ResumeGo suggest that doubling page counts can actually improve your chances of getting hired, with recruiters 2.3 times likelier to prefer two-page documents, and prone to spending more time reviewing these write-ups.\n\nSo what’s the right answer? It all depends on how much background and experience you have that’s directly relevant to the position, and how much space you need to clearly and concisely get the message across that you’re a candidate worth considering.\n\nThink of a resume like the back of a book or a trailer for a movie: It’s a quick summary of your background and accomplishments, designed to tease readers into wanting to get the full story. In effect, it’s a brief biographical narrative that quickly tells the story of your professional life, highlights your achievements, and why the position you’re applying for makes a logical fit. Like any good teaser, it shouldn’t just be accessible and compelling. It also should be only as long as needed to pique the viewer’s interest.\n\nBefore beginning, keep a couple helpful rules of thumb in mind. At a minimum, your resume should fill out a full page—if it’s too short or light on detail, recruiters may assume that you’re lacking in skills or experience. And if hasn’t been formatted into easily digestible subheads, sidebars, and bullet points, and still exceeds two pages in length, they may also skip over it because it’s too daunting and probably bloated anyway.\n\nAll of which points to an ideal solution which lies somewhere in the middle: A smart, punchy, 1- to 1.5-page document that succinctly summarizes information about you, underscores what makes you unique, and exceeds a single page only if there’s relevant work experience or honors and awards to present. A two-page resume is typically the sort that’s reserved for individuals with a highly accomplished history and extensive experience, e.g. 10 to 20 years of work, in a related field.\n\nHere are a few tips that can help you size your resume the right way when you’re crafting the document:\n\nDon’t attempt to pad or inflate: The faster you cut to the chase, the better for busy hiring managers.\n\nKeep readability in mind. Resumes should be legible, laid out well, and neatly spaced. Avoid the temptation to shrink fonts to cram in more data. Instead, focus on capturing the reader’s eye and getting important points across at a glance.\n\nFocus on telling a clear, simple story about your background and experience and how your work relates to the prospective position, highlighting two to three key differentiators that set you apart from other applicants.\n\nDon’t forget that visual representations such as infographics, charts, and images can help you quickly convey complex information, often while saving  space and standing out. Graphic elements should be eye-catching, professional, and representative of the image you wish to convey to potential employers. However, before you include any visuals, the culture of the organizations you’re applying to should be considered (more conservative firms may find such touches less endearing).\n\nInclude search engine keywords—terms that a recruiter may be likely to punch into a computer (e.g. are they looking for “business analysts” or “market research” pros). Working these terms into your document can help ensure you pop up in queries and improve chances of success.\n\nBe specific when promoting your achievements. Did you grow sales by 300% in Q4? Add 20,000 monthly new visitors to an organization’s blog? Oversee the rollout of a $1 million advertising campaign that generated 20 million impressions? Skip generalities and show what you can do for an employer.\n\nConsider where overviews and shortlists make sense. A bullet-point rundown of certifications, publications, courses taken, etc. often provides enough general information to pique recruiters’ interest—they can always follow up if they have additional questions.\n\nWhile the ideal length of a resume differs depending on the individual candidate, position, and employer involved, the general rule is that less is more. The faster and more succinctly you can make a case for yourself as a prospective candidate, and highlight key career achievements, the better your prospects of getting hired will be.\n\nScott Steinberg is the author of The Business Etiquette Bible.\n\nDo you have a workplace etiquette question?

          "description": "Ikea has set a release date of April 1st for its aggressively priced smart blinds in the United States, according to a Fast Company report, only a couple of months after the motorized shades’ debut in Europe on February 2nd. There, Ikea priced its Fyrtur blackout shades between $113 and $181 (converted from euros), with blind sizes ranging from the width of your average room window, all the way up to 195 cm (76.8 inches) wide.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of smart blinds before — internet-controlled automated shades — that’s probably because most smart blinds cost anywhere between $300-500. Their high cost makes them a tough smart home upgrade to swallow, so any affordable competition in this space is worth learning more about. However, Ikea’s official pricing in the US is still unannounced.\n\nIkea also promises their upcoming smart blinds will come bundled with a remote control and a rechargeable battery pack, as well as support for Alexa, HomeKit, and Google Assistant control and integration. That’s all I ever wanted out of smart blinds, really.\n\nIkea also integrated their Trådfri smart lights and smart plugs with their blinds, which will work with the same app and will be able to communicate with your shades to dim or brighten lights, according to the time of day. The smart blinds will even support Ikea’s existing Vidga curtain rail series, so if you already own Ikea curtains, there’s a possibility you’re already on the path to using Ikea’s smart blinds.\n",

          "description": "A lot is shifting in the retail business. Stores are changing, new technology is emerging, retail space is shrinking, phones are an increasingly popular way to buy pretty much everything, and who even knows if Sears—a 125-year-old retailer that once defined how Americans shopped—will exist for much longer.\n\nBut of all the trends that have emerged over the past few years as contenders for a piece of retail’s future—experiential brand temples! on-demand in-store production! mini-stores!—not all are realistically going to have a marked effect in 2019. Some are still in their early stages, while the value of others is uncertain to both brands and shoppers.\n\nCB Insights, a strategic intelligence firm, gathered up the biggest trends in retail and analyzed where they stand as the year gets underway. The resulting matrix, based on what CB Insights calls its NExTT framework, offers a picture of the changes set to have a high impact in the near term, and the ideas that are likely to become increasingly important in the future. On one axis is how widely adopted the trend is, taking into account factors such as the momentum of startups in the space. On the other is the trend’s “market strength,” determined by the quality and number of investors behind it, investments in R&D, forecasts of its market size, and other indicators.\n\nFrom that data, CB Insights grouped the trends into four different categories:\n\nExperimental: Trends that are in their early stages or have proofs of concept, but that haven’t produced many useful products or aren’t widely adopted in the marketplace yet.\n\nTransitory: Ideas that retailers have been rolling out, but where there’s still a lot of uncertainly about their value and how retailers can best use them.\n\nThreatening: These have a large potential market and investment capital flowing into them, but only the earliest adopters have so far put them into practice.\n\nNecessary: The stuff with a clear, understandable value that lots of retailers have already put into place and shoppers are actively using. At this point, companies should already have plans for how to make use of these in 2019.\n\nThe dot colors in the chart refer to what part of the retail industry the trend affects. Blue is product, purple is merchandising, and orange is supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe value of stores that are destinations in themselves, as opposed to just places to transact sales, and of brand private labels is well-established by now. The same goes for personalized marketing, which allows brands to tailor things like ads and emails to the person receiving it, greatly increasing the chance of it being effective, and small-format stores, which make sense as e-commerce grows and giant stores become a burden. These rank among the “necessary” trends of 2019, according to CB Insights.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the trends with the greatest breakout potential are in the “threatening” category, since they’re receiving a good deal of interest and investment but aren’t common yet, such as in-store tech tech and data collection. The ColorIQ technology that beauty retailer Sephora launched some years ago is an example. Customers can use the handheld device to scan their skin in order to “precisely match skin tones to available products online and in-store,” CB Insights explains. “Each time customers scan their skin in-store, Sephora saves this data to personalize in-app and online product assortments.” That sort of data is invaluable to retailers, for personalized marketing and more. But not many retailers have been able to find opportunities like Sephora has.\n\nAlibaba’s “Smile to Pay” system at a KFC in China.\nMore radical possibilities for in-store tech and data collection emerging, though. In China, Alibaba has invested in companies developing facial-recognition technology, allowing it to do things like allow customers in a KFC to pay for meals with their faces. Due to privacy concerns, the US regulates facial-recognition technology more than China does. But, CB Insights notes, “If this type of technology does ever gain traction in the US, it could set a precedent for the types of data (down to consumers’ facial expressions) that retailers and other companies may be able to capture. This could help retailers bring personalization to an entirely new level—tailoring each consumer interaction based on data (for instance, an individual’s mood interpreted from a facial expression) to drive consumer interest and loyalty.”\n\nMore common, however, are other “threatening” trends, such as visual search, which a number of retailers have launched lately, including the fashion retailer Farfetch, which partnered with AI startup Syte to enable visual search in its iOS app. Another is in-store mobile commerce. One recent example: At the new Nike flagship in New York, shoppers can make their purchases through Nike’s app.\n\nFarfetch’s visual search function, powered by Syte.\nNot all trends worth paying attention to are things customers see. “One thing I’ve really been trying to zero in on and bring out in my research is the importance of supply chain and logistics to retailers,” says Natan Reddy, senior intelligence analyst at CB Insights. Notable in that group is inventory management, an obsession of retail’s for some time that means brands better optimizing how much of their products they make, when they make them, and where they distribute them. Companies such as Zara are expert in this arena, making them highly efficient and profitable.\n\nThe top supply-chain and distributions trends that are still “experimental,” according to CB Insights, include autonomous last-mile delivery and what Reddy calls “the perfect use case” for blockchain: monitoring the supply chain.\n\n“There tends to be a lack of communication between different players along the supply chain, whether that is a warehouse and manufacturer in China, a shipping company that’s shipping stuff over from China to the US, for example,” he says, noting that these tend to be disparate companies spread over different geographies. “What blockchain provides is a centralized platform for the different players to actually track where along the process that particular shipment or item is, and it reduces fraud, paperwork, and a whole other laundry list of things that create a lot of delays and cost.”\n\nBut that idea only works if brands and suppliers can get on the same platform. Instead, a number of separate pilot programs are in the works, which is why blockchain is still in the “experimental” category. Though Reddy adds that shipping giant Maersk and IBM have one promising project in the works that’s drawing many major global suppliers.\n\nWhat about the trends less likely to make a mark in 2019? “At-home voice assistants aren’t the game changer for at-home shopping that some may have hoped for,” CB Insights says in its report, noting that only about 2% of Amazon Alexa users had shopped using voice in 2018, according to a report from the summer. The situation could still change as the technology develops and more households around the world buy smart speakers.\n\nAnother is social commerce, depending on the country. In China, Pinduoduo has been a huge success with its mix of social media and e-commerce. American shoppers, however, have tended to treat those as distinct activities, which is why, despite many efforts over the years by companies such as Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook to make social commerce work in the US, “most of the time it hasn’t gone well,” Reddy says. In 2019, it’s still not likely to.\n",

          "description": "So you came out of the holidays with a fancy new 4K TV? It doesn’t get much better than that. After managing to unbox it and finding the perfect spot in your living room to put it, the next crucial step is downloading the right apps that can showcase that big screen. \n\nThe easiest, fastest way to locate these apps is to open the app store on your TV — whether it be a Roku TV, Samsung TV, LG, Sony, Vizio, or something else — and look for a list of the most popular downloads. You’ll likely spot many of the choices that I’ve included below right there. If your TV comes with a voice remote, you can also look for them that way. \n\nNote that not all of these apps will be available on every smart TV. The best way to maximize your content selection is to buy a set-top box such as a Roku Premiere, Fire TV Stick 4K, or Apple TV 4K. (For complete information on how to choose which hardware you need for which apps, check out The Verge Cord Cutter’s Guide: Hardware, Software, and Services.) \n\nI’ve divided the list into several categories: “TV Everywhere” apps, which are associated with traditional cable stations; TV streaming services, which are an alternative to cable; and standalone, specialized apps.\n\nWe’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used apps, games, and utilities. Look for our picks for iPhones, PCs, and Mac; our favorite games for iOS and Android, and our top choices for the PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch. \n\nTV Everywhere apps\n\nThese are apps that require a cable account login to get the most from them. If you want to watch full-length episodes, you’ll have to sign in. Most major cable networks have their own app. \n\nThere’s nothing necessarily better about watching your programs via these standalone apps versus just pulling up the on-demand options for these channels on your cable box. But if you prefer to keep things separated or hate your cable interface, they’re a nice option to fall back on. I’ve listed them here along with the services where they’re available.\n\nNote that many of these apps now accept login credentials from DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other OTT TV providers such as FuboTV. \n\nA&E Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nABC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nAMC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBBC America Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBET Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nCBS Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nComedy Central Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nThe CW Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nE!

Prices range from $25 for Sling TV up to over $70 for the most complete channel packages from DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. You’ll definitely want to reference our Cord Cutter’s Guide for help in picking the one that offers your favorite channels.\n\nStandalone streaming apps\n\n        Roku\n\nThese are either the streaming versions of specific channels, or offer specialized content. My list includes the obvious essentials such as Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video, but I’ve added others that aren’t quite as well known. I won’t bother describing the obvious must-haves to you, but I’ve included some comments about some of the lesser-known apps you might want to consider. \n\nCBS All Access\n\nCrackleNetflix stole away Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, but Crackle still has an okay mix of movies to stream.

          "description": "In a country where public displeasure at crying babies is the norm, Japanese companies keep coming up with new ways to keep them quiet.\n\nCarmaker Honda is the newest company to have a go at that, inventing a plush toy car called a Sound Sitter that allegedly mimics the sound that babies hear in the womb, which is apparently at a similar frequency to a car engine. The company tested over 30 different of its car models, and found that the NSX model, launched in 2016, was the most soothing for babies. Honda said that 11 out of 12 babies were soothed by the sound of the engine, which can be activated via a smartphone.\n\nCrying babies are a particular source of embarrassment and concern for Japanese mothers, who bear the brunt of others’ disapproval if they are unable to keep their babies quiet in public. That led a group of women in 2016 to start a grassroots campaign, the “We Love Babies Project,” which encouraged Japanese people to wear stickers bearing the words Naitemo iiyo! (“It’s OK to cry!”) to address the stigma of babies crying in public. Even politicians have waded into the discussion, with a group of 13 male governors this year coming together to pledge their support for the campaign, which also calls on restaurants and other establishments to proclaim themselves baby-friendly zones with the sticker.\n\nAnother company that has tried to tackle the problem of crying babies is All Nippon Airways, which last year conducted research to figure out how to stop babies from crying during takeoff and landing. The carrier said that its research found that some parents with small children avoided flying out of concerns that their babies would disturb other passengers.\n\nSome people have put Japan’s intolerance of crying children down to the country’s ultra-low birthrate, which means many Japanese people simply aren’t used to the sound. The phenomenon also takes place against a backdrop of a society which is often seen as unsupportive of new mothers—something the country of 127 million desperately needs to change as it tries to combat its dwindling population.\n\nA lawmaker was kicked out of a regional parliament last year for bringing her baby to the chamber, while another received blame (paywall) for getting pregnant at all, with politicians—who are almost always middle-aged or elderly men—espousing views in support of outdated gender roles. The prevalence of “maternity harassment” (mata-hara) also means that many women simply choose to drop out of the work force once they become pregnant, in order avoid mistreatment at work by bosses disgruntled at their employees’ pregnant state.\n\nGiven that Honda’s Sound Sitter was an in-house experimentthat won’t be made commercially available immediately—parents trying to soothe their agitated kids in public might be better off joining the campaign to fight the stigma of crying babies instead.\n",

          "description": "Whenever casual acquaintances hear how much my family visits Disneyland in Anaheim, California, they invariably ask about the long lines. Most are surprised to hear my response: “I don’t do lines at Disneyland.” How is that possible in a place that is regularly in the news for massive crowds? Sure, the crowds at Disneyland can be crushing. But if you have a smart strategy, it’s 100% possible to dodge most lines.\n\nDisney California Adventure at night. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nTo do so, you simply need the right information to construct a smart touring plan. That’s where this guide to skipping Disneyland lines comes in. Here are all the tools that savvy travelers can employ to have much shorter wait times on a Disneyland vacation (although all bets are likely off in the first few months after Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opens in summer 2019).\n\nIf you are new to Disneyland travel, first read 9 Things Families Should Know Before Visiting Disneyland, and then come back to this guide for more advanced lessons on reducing your Disneyland wait times.\n\n1. Consult a Crowd Calendar\n\nAn easy way to experience shorter lines is to visit Disneyland when everyone else isn’t. There are days where Disneyland crowds are terrible and days when the parks feel fairly empty.\n\nMassive crowds on Main Street USA on a busy Veterans Day Weekend. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nHow do you accurately choose a less crowded Disneyland date? There are a number of sites that publish crowd calendars to help you choose smarter days to visit if you have some date flexibility. TouringPlans.com and IsItPacked.com are two of the most reputable and accurate sites.\n\nOf course, many travelers, especially families with kids in school, can’t always choose a low crowd day for their Disneyland vacation. That’s still OK — there are many other line avoidance strategies that should be in your toolbox.\n\n2. Arrive for Rope Drop\n\nThe most straightforward way to stand in line less at Disneyland — on any day — is simply to be in the parks during the lowest crowd times of the day. The crowds are always much smaller first thing in the morning. Many guests have trouble getting up early on vacation, which is a loophole that you should exploit. You can often get as much done in the first hour after Disneyland opens than you can all afternoon when crowds are much heavier.\n\nBe rewarded with empty walkways when you enter at rope drop! (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nSo how do you put yourself in the position to take maximum advantage first thing in the morning? It’s not enough to arrive at the parks a few minutes before the published park opening time. Instead, you need to put yourself among the early crowds that line up for “rope drop.”\n\nSo, what is rope drop? Usually, Disneyland and Disney California Adventure will open the gates up to 30 minutes before the published park opening times. Guests can stroll up Main Street USA (or Buena Vista Street in DCA) and queue behind a rope further into the parks that cast members will “drop” at the park’s official opening time. If you are right along the rope, you can be one of the first making a mad dash (I mean, “walking” quickly) to the most popular attractions.\n\nOn low crowd days, I recommend lining up at park gates at least 45 minutes before the park opening to make rope drop. On busier days, an hour or more is recommended to get maximum value from your time. Remember also that you have to pass through Disney’s security and bag checks first (and take the parking shuttle if you are arriving via car), so leave time for all those steps.\n\n3. Enter During the Extra Magic Hour\n\nFor Disneyland guests splurging on a Disney-owned hotel, Disney makes a valuable early-entry privilege available: Extra Magic Hour (“EMH”). On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, Disneyland park opens one hour early for Disney hotel guests. The same one hour early-entry privileges are available on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays for Disney California Adventure. Not every attraction is open at that time, but many of the most sought-after ones are.\n\nThe Disneyland Hotel is one of three Disney-owned hotels that have Extra Magic Hour early-entry privileges. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nIf you thought rope drop was great for short lines, Extra Magic Hour is that much better since it is capacity controlled. In Disneyland, for example, I find it is possible to ride at least five to eight Fantasyland and Tomorrowland attractions in this single hour. Especially smart picks are Peter Pan (but only if you are speedy and in the very front of the group entering the park), Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride, Dumbo, Matterhorn and Space Mountain. Over in Disney California Adventure, top attractions to ride during EMH include Radiator Springs Racers, Toy Story Mania! and Soarin’.\n\nExtra Magic Hour is also a smart time to snag a FastPass or two for attractions before anyone else can even enter the parks (more on FastPass below).\n\n4. Make the Most of Magic Mornings\n\nAlthough Extra Magic Hour is only available to guests staying at Disney-owned hotels, guests staying off-property near Disneyland aren’t entirely out of luck. Disneyland also offers tickets to guests staying in non-Disney hotels that offer one “Magic Morning” early-entry privilege. This perk is only available on park tickets of three or more days, and only for pre-purchased tickets, so don’t wait to buy three-plus day tickets at the Disneyland gates.\n\nMagic Morning offers early entry into Disneyland park only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Simply pick which day works best for your schedule with no advance selection required. Guests using Magic Morning enter Disneyland park along with the on-property guests who are using their Extra Magic Hour privileges. Note that there’s not a Magic Morning option for Disney California Adventure park.\n\nNote that Disneyland tickets have returned (at least for now) to the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel site, so put those points to use! \n\n5. Use FastPass\n\nMany theme parks have cut-the-line or virtual queuing services that help you stand in line less, but so many of them charge for the privilege. Disneyland offers its own virtual queueing service called FastPass. Unlike at some other theme parks, however, it’s free.\n\n(Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nDiffering a bit from the current iteration of FastPass+ at Walt Disney World, Disneyland’s FastPass service can only be booked and used the same day you are in the parks. Simply scan your park ticket at kiosks outside of a ride offering FastPass to receive a one-hour-long return time window for the attraction. For the most part, you can only get one FastPass at a time, but check the reminder slip you will receive to learn when you are eligible for another FastPass. It’s possible to accrue more quickly while working within the rules of the system.\n\nWhen your FastPass return window starts, enter the attraction through the FastPass queue by scanning your park ticket. FastPass doesn’t let you cut the ride’s line entirely, but you’ll be on most attractions within about five to 15 minutes rather than the 60- to 90-minute waits that have become standard for attractions like Radiator Springs Racers or Space Mountain.\n\n6. Upgrade Your FastPass Experience With Disney MaxPass\n\nIf you want to take your FastPass experience up a level, however, I recommend the paid upgrade to Disney MaxPass, which is currently $10 per day, per ticket. MaxPass enables guests to book FastPasses on their smartphones.\n\nUse your smartphone to redeem MaxPasses at Disneyland to access shorter lines. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nWhy is MaxPass superior to FastPass? With MaxPass, there’s no running from one ride kiosk to another just to make a reservation. The transit time savings are immense. You can book MaxPasses for a new ride while standing in line for one you just redeemed. Additionally, you can even book a MaxPass for a ride in Disney California Adventure while in Disneyland park and vice versa.\n\nMaxPass users also get a jump on regular FastPass users in several ways. For example, you can book a FastPass with MaxPass as soon as your ticket is scanned to enter the park. That means you can get a MaxPass while waiting behind the rope drop line on Main Street USA when regular FastPass users can’t even physically get to the booking kiosks. Additionally, MaxPass regularly offers earlier return times than regular FastPass.\n\nMaxPass offering superior return times for Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: BREAKOUT! (7:05pm for MaxPass but 7:55pm for regular FastPass). (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nFor guests planning to ride even a few of the thrill rides, MaxPass is absolutely worth the cost for the upgrade every time. I often find myself able to accrue so many MaxPasses within the rules of the system that I simply don’t have time to walk to all the attractions I’ve booked. It’s a good problem to have.\n\nThere’s one final mini-hack that both MaxPass and FastPass users should maximize. If a ride goes down when you have a FastPass/MaxPass booked for it, the system automatically converts it into a multi-attraction FastPass you can use for any ride in that park any time for the rest of the day. There’s nothing more glorious than having a FastPass for a less popular attraction like Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin and find you are able to use it to shortcut the line at Space Mountain or Matterhorn instead!\n\nWhen a ride goes down, your FastPass or MaxPass turns into a “multi-attraction” pass that can be used on many rides in the same park. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\n7. Go Solo With Single Rider\n\nDisneyland has increasingly made single rider lines available in the last couple of years. These lines are usually much shorter than the standard line, but come with the caveat that your party will be split up to fill in empty scattered seats on the attraction’s ride vehicles. Unless you have small kids who aren’t ready to ride alone, or are trying to capture that perfect family ride photo all in a single vehicle, using single rider lines are a no-brainer. I’ve used them to literally walk on Space Mountain when the ride had a 60-minute posted wait time. They are usually helpful on Radiator Springs Racers (especially midmorning) and Incredicoaster.\n\nRadiator Springs is one of several thrill rides that offers single rider lines. (Photo by Leslie Harvey)\n\nA few words of warning, however, about single rider lines. First, even attractions that offer single rider lines don’t always offer them consistently. Indiana Jones, for example, is notorious for the disappearing and reappearing single rider line. Goofy’s Sky School often only opens the line when the regular wait time exceeds about 20 minutes.\n\nSecond, single rider lines can and do get shut down on busy park days when the line gets too long for the small spaces they occupy. As a result, these lines tend to function most optimally on medium crowd days when the demand for rides is sufficient to open them, but not so great as to overwhelm their capacity.\n\n8. Swap Out With Rider Switch\n\nWhile Disneyland’s Rider Switch won’t necessarily shorten your wait times, it is a valuable service that will prevent families with babies, toddlers and young children from waiting in extra lines. Rider Switch enables parents or caregivers to take turns caring for little ones who are too small or too scared to ride — and still only stand in line once.\n\nRider Switch works by allowing, for example, mom to go on Matterhorn with big sis while dad stays behind with baby brother. Then dad gets to go on the ride right afterward (usually by entering via the FastPass line or another access point with no wait) while mom takes care of baby brother. Big sis even gets to ride a second time with dad if you request it, as the second group of riders can include up to three people! Big siblings everywhere can rejoice. Combine Rider Switch with FastPass or MaxPass for even shorter waits for the first group of riders.\n\n9. Book a Dining Package\n\nSome of the longest waits guests have at Disneyland are to see popular parades and evening shows like Fantasmic. Guests often camp out for an hour or two or more for the prime viewing areas. While these waits aren’t technically “lines,” most of us want to avoid them.\n\nScore great views with shorter waits for Fantasmic and other shows with dining packages. (Photo by Joshua Sudock / Disneyland Resort)\n\nIf parades are a priority for you (they don’t happen to be for my family), then you can shortcut these long waits by booking a parade or show dining package. These dining packages include a meal as well as a reserved viewing area for the show. To be sure, booking a dining package isn’t the most budget-friendly way to do Disneyland. You’ll pay more for these meals than you would at a regular Disneyland restaurant, but the up-charge can well be worth the time saved waiting for a good view of the show.\n\nThe restaurants and included shows change with the seasons, so be sure to check the Disneyland site for all the offerings during your visit. Disneyland dining can be booked up to 60 days in advance, so have your rough plan in place by this date to secure the more popular packages.\n\n10. Be a VIP (or Just Luck into Disney Magic)\n\nAlthough all of the strategies we’ve discussed thus far are available to mere mortals, there are some VIP and lesser-known tricks to cut down your wait time.\n\nHire a VIP Tour Guide: For the ultimate splurge, hire a Disneyland tour guide (affectionately known as a “Plaid”) for the day. Your guide will escort you onto rides with no waits and no FastPass needed. Prices start at $2,975 for seven hours and your group can include up to 10 people.\n\nDine with a Club 33 Member: If you are lucky enough to know someone who is a member at the exclusive and expensive Club 33, you can usually score extra multi-attraction FastPasses from cast members when you dine there.\n\nAttend a DVC Sales Presentation: There are a number of kiosks around the Disneyland Resort where you can hear a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) pitch. DVC is Disney’s take on the timeshare and incentives, including gift cards and FastPasses, are offered for attending one of the sessions. As with all timeshare presentations, question whether your time spent in the session is worth the time saved in attraction lines with the FastPasses and other benefits you receive.\n\nLuck into Disney Magic: Last but certainly not least, sometimes Disney pixie dust falls onto your head when you least expect it. Cast members at Disneyland often have FastPasses they can give out at their discretion, just to spread Disney magic. You’ll find reports of guests receiving them under a wide variety of circumstances, such as simply keeping their cool when other guests were behaving badly when something went awry. While you should always be on your best behavior at the Happiest Place on Earth, being an exceptionally good guest can sometimes pay off in ways you might not expect.\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou can’t control how many other people visit the “Happiest Place on Earth”, but you do have a lot of control over how much of your day is spent in line at Disneyland.

          "description": "Typically, when we think of Cairo, the last things that would probably come to mind are jingle bells or Jack Frost nipping at our noses. We’d probably think more about regular prayer calls from the neighborhood mosques and a Sphinx with a nipped nose.\n\nThe Sphinx (Photo by Kitti Boonnitrod / Getty Images)\n\nHowever, one of the most fantastic things about Cairo in December is the love the locals have for the Christmas season. So, if Cairo wasn’t on your list of travels for this season, it may just need to be added. In fact, TPG says this could be the time to add Egypt back to your bucket list — especially because of its newly discovered chamber of mummies and 4,000-year-old Egyptian tomb.\n\nTis the season in this typically tropical country and here are five things you probably don’t know about Christmas in this amazing ancient city!\n\n1. Cairo Has a Fantastic Ice-skating Rink\n\nWhat better way to experience a winter wonderland than going ice skating? Nestled within the Cairo Festival City Mall in New Cairo, “Ice Land” gives all the feeling of the Christmas season. Made of a synthetic material, the rink allows everyone of all ages to come and enjoy this favorite winter pastime while indoors. There’s also a second location in Point 90 Mall, which is situated across the street from the American University of Cairo. Here, you can catch a game of ice hockey or even a performance from professional “Disney on Ice” figure skaters.\n\n2. Sales, Sales and More Sales\n\nOne of the best parts about being in Cairo during the Christmas season is that there are always massive sales. From mall to mall, you’ll find some of your favorite brands at extremely discounted prices. It’s like having Black Friday every day during the month of December. And, with the Egyptian pound substantially lower than other currencies, your money can go a lot further picking up gifts and knickknacks for everyone. You may need to head to Khan El Khalili (Old Cairo) and pick up an extra piece of luggage for the flight home!\n\nYou can purchase hand-crafted Christmas ornaments at markets in Cairo. (Photo via Shutterstock)\n\n3. The New Uber Bus Was Just Unveiled in Cairo\n\nOn Dec. 4, the CEO of the ride-hailing service unveiled Uber’s first minibus service in Egypt. In fact, Cairo is the first city in the world with this option. This feature can be found under the same settings as UberX, Select and Scooter. With this option, you can literally bring the whole family and enjoy some of the fantastic sights during your holiday break without hailing multiple taxis or paying for a driver. In Egypt, you can pay for Uber with cash and for longer distance rides (45 minutes to an hour), you’ll still only pay about $7 to $10.\n\n4. Don’t Be Fooled by the Daytime Weather\n\nAlthough the temperatures boast spring-like weather in December, as the evening approaches, it’ll begin to feel a lot like Christmas. OK, maybe just a little. But do be sure to carry a jacket, sweater or extra layer because temperatures fall about 10 to 20 degrees at night. However, with the multitude of coffee and tea shops, you’ll be sure to warm up in no time.\n\nNighttime in Cairo (Photo by Emad Aljumah / Getty Images)\n\n5. Cairo Celebrates Two Christmases!\n\nYes, you read that correctly. The beauty of celebrating Christmas in Cairo is that western Christmas (Dec. 25) is observed, as well as Coptic Christmas (Jan, 7). For the entire month of December and through the New Year, you and the family can enjoy the Christmas spirit with the vast array of decorations and celebrations.\n\nCelebrating Coptic Christmas in Cairo (Photo by Khaled Desouki / Getty Images)\n\nThis year, The Nile Ritz-Carlton, Cairo (currently just 35k Marriott Rewards points per night — so use a Marriott 35k certificate) will host daily activities from Dec. 23 through Jan. 7. This will include everything from your favorite Christmas indulgences, like gingerbread houses and eggnog, a Christmas movie viewing schedule, to a “Christmas Wonderland”-themed party. There’ll also be an appearance from Santa himself in the Lobby Lounge on Dec. 25.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Cairo next Christmas, you may want to stay at the new St. Regis Cairo (set to open in early 2019), as it is also a Category 5 property in the Marriott Rewards program. This means that the annual certificates from cards such as the Marriott Rewards Premier Plus Credit Card or Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express can really come in handy for a bit of luxury while enjoying the holiday spirit on a budget in Cairo.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf visiting Cairo during the Christmas break is on your list, you can apply for your entry visa, in advance. The process is very simple, but be sure to give yourself a minimum of two weeks to apply before your trip. Otherwise, Egypt also offers the option of purchasing your visa upon arrival for $25 per person, before reaching border patrol. Also, with it being peak season around the holidays, give yourself enough time to book your flights, accommodations and tours.\n\nHave you been to Cairo at Christmastime?

          "description": "Editor’s note: This is a guest article from Will Whitson. \n\nIs there any household appliance more underrated than the common garbage disposal? It comes standard in almost every house or apartment on the market. It’s generally out of sight and out of mind until your orange rinds, potato shavings, or leftovers start sending murky water back up the drain. With the flick of a switch, this kitchen workhorse goes to town, gets the job done, and leaves the sink clean and clear. It’s a modern marvel . . . until it stops working, that is.\n\nThere are few annoyances worse than turning on a garbage disposal, expecting the roar of industrial steel tearing through your refuse, and being met with either an nasty grinding sound or the dull, electric hum of failure. That disposal under your sink can be intimidating to fix if you’ve never dealt with one before. But before you give a costly plumber a call, there are a few quick steps that can solve the majority of your disposal woes.\n\nFirst though, let’s look at some common items you don’t want to put down the drain.\n\nAn Ounce of Prevention: What NOT to Put Down the Drain\n\nThe best method for unclogging your garbage disposal is naturally to not get it clogged in the first place!\n\nThere are a number of known culprits that tend to more easily muck up this household device. There’s the obvious non-food stuff like bottle caps, small toys (from unknowing kids), the occasional small utensil that can find its way into the drain without your knowing, etc. But there are a handful of food-related saboteurs that may not be so obvious. All the below items should remain out of your disposal to the best of your ability (that is, if small amounts of these things slip in, it’s not a huge deal, but don’t make it a habit): \n\nBones/seafood shells (from steaks, chicken, turkey, lobster, oysters, etc.) \n\nCoffee grounds (they condense into a thick, gooey mess) \n\nOatmeal, pasta, rice — anything that expands in water (small amounts are okay, but don’t put entire dishes of the stuff through the disposal)\n\nNuts (how do you think peanut butter is made?) \n\nOnion skins (can avoid the blades and end up in your plumbing in their entirety)\n\nEgg shells (more about the thin membrane inside the shells, which can do the same thing as the onion skins above)\n\nFibrous vegetables (celery, pumpkin, squash, etc.) \n\nPotato peels (see onion skins and egg shells above) \n\nFruit pits/peels \n\nPaint (can adhere to your disposal/piping, eventually causing hard-to-remedy buildups)\n\nShould any of the above items manage to clog up your disposal, put on your DIY hat, and proceed to the below steps to get things fixed up in a jiffy. \n\nHow to Unclog Your Garbage Disposal\n\nIMPORTANT — Before You Begin DIY-ing\n\nWhile fixing and removing an obstruction is fairly straightforward, there are a few safety steps and common rules you want to follow to avoid an embarrassing call to the plumber, or a terrifying trip to the ER.\n\nShut off the power! If you’re like me, you get flashbacks to Final Destination 2 any time you have to work with the disposal. Either unplug it, or if you can’t do that, switch off the circuit breaker providing electricity to the disposal. Far better to be safe than sorry!\n\nDon’t try to remove the disposal from your sink. While it may have to be removed if it’s a serious clog, don’t take it apart unless you absolutely have to. You risk damaging the waterproof seal between the drain and the actual machine. Plus, when you’re working in a confined space, removing it is a whole lot easier than putting it back together.\n\nShut off the water supply if you’re going to have to remove any pipes. You don’t want to accidentally make things worse by unintentionally stopping for a drink of water midway through repairs. Make sure there’s no risk of soaking your kitchen.\n\nWhat You’ll Need\n\nRubber or latex gloves (it’s gonna get gross)\n\nGarbage bag for dirty or removed items\n\nPlastic tub to catch any water that may drain out\n\nWire brush or pipe cleaner\n\nDisposal jam or ¼” Allen wrench\n\nScrewdriver\n\nStep 1: Go in From the Top\n\nAfter you’ve taken the precaution of cutting the power, put on some gloves and carefully use your fingers to feel around in the disposal. If you’ve been hearing a grinding sound when you turn it on, something large may be obstructing the blades (like a whiskey stone from the adult beverage you enjoyed the night before), and fixing the problem may be as simple as pulling it out.\n\nIf you’re still getting just an electric hum, it may be something smaller in between the blades or deeper down the drain. Proceed to the next step. \n\nStep 2: Attack From Below!\n\nManual crank.\n\nThe easiest way to remove an obstruction is to manually operate the disposal. At the very bottom of the machine is a small, hexagonal indention. Using a universal jam wrench (or an Allen wrench to save a few dollars), turn the blades back and forth, maybe even doing a few full rotations of the blades.\n\nOperating the manual crank.\n\nIf there’s an obstruction, you’ll likely be able to hear it as you turn the blades. A few rotations tend to loosen whatever is blocking the motor, and you can then reach back into the sink and pull it out. In my case, it was a half dozen aquarium rocks my well-meaning daughter had rinsed out of Scuba Steve’s tank.\n\nNote that some models may have a reversing switch that accomplishes the same action.\n\nStep 3: Still No Luck? Time to Disconnect Piping \n\nThe pipe you want to focus on.\n\nIf you remove a few small obstructions and it still isn’t working, then something is clogging it up from below — likely in the plumbing itself. You’ll need to disconnect the piping. (Not the dishwasher hose, which is smaller/narrower and connected higher up on the disposal; that’s only given attention if your dishwasher is having problems draining.) \n\nDishwasher hose.\n\nOnce you’ve disconnected the pipe, run a wire brush through to unclog and possibly remove the blockage. Re-connect the pipe, and proceed to the next step. \n\nStep 4: Re-Connect Power and Hit the Reset  \n\nRed reset button.\n\nLike a power outlet or circuit breaker, a garbage disposal has a safety mechanism that trips if something goes wrong. It’s down at the bottom of the disposal, near the manual crank. It’s usually a red, rectangular button that pops out like a GFCI button on an outlet. Once you’ve hooked everything back up and are ready for a test, push the safety button back into place and give it test.\n\nStep 5: Celebrate!\n\nCrack open the celebratory beverage of your choice as your wife or girlfriend marvels at your money-saving handyman skills. Just don’t drop the bottle cap down the disposal.\n\n_________________________________\n\nWill Whitson is a news producer and long-time AoM reader.

          "description": "When the classic-movie streaming service FilmStruck shuttered last month, it caused a palpable panic among cineastes. Overstuffed with exceptional big-studio films and arthouse gems, the service represented a viable alternative to the big streamers, many of which offer relatively meager film catalogs. And FilmStruck's demise was especially troubling when you realize just how many movies, from Oscar-winners to low-budget oddities, are completely missing from streaming services altogether. What are America's raging Cocoon-heads supposed to do?\n\nFor those looking for a flick-filled streaming alternative, however, there's Kanopy, an impressively stocked service available to many university students and library-card holders around the world. Though Kanopy's availability and selection varies based on your location, its catalog features must-watch titles from such outlets as the Criterion Collection, Paramount Pictures, and the recently-added A24, home of Moonlight and Lady Bird. You still won't find Cocoon, but here are a few choice Kanopy kuts that will get you started.\n\nMetropolis (1927)\n\nIf you haven't seen Fritz Lang's silent future-set classic in a while—or if you only know the movie from its pop-culture footprint—now's the perfect time to plunge into its gorgeous art-deco dystopia. It's just as visually majestic, and as politically astute, as it was nearly a century ago.\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker (1953)\n\nDirector Ida Lupino's three-man noir follows a pair of average-joe road-trippers who pick up a murderous roadside hitchhiker—and are subsequently forced into a slow-boiling sojourn through Mexico. A tense ripper full of great performances, including William Talman as the bastardly kidnapper, The Hitch-Hiker is just as relentless as the desert sun itself.\n\nPurple Noon (1960)\n\nDecades before Matt Damon slimmed down for 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley, Patricia Highsmith's classic stolen-identity novel was chillingly adapted by French director René Clément. With its gorgeous European locations, cruel twists of fate, and distractingly foxy cast, Noon is thoroughly beguiling.\n\nSave the Tiger (1973)\n\nA forgotten existential-crisis classic, Save the Tiger stars Jack Lemmon as a troubled LA businessman whose flailing career forces him to take desperate measures. Lemmon, rough and wry, plays a middle-aged man who no longer recognizes the world around him; it's one of his greatest roles, and would eventually win an Oscar.\n\nClue (1985)\n\nA once-drubbed novelty that has grown into a genuinely beloved latter-day hit, Clue nowadays feels like a true rarity: A zippy, quippy screwball murder-mystery in which several fantastic performers—from Michael McKean to Madeline Kahan—gamefully play along without ever batting a wink.\n\nDogtooth (2009)\n\nNearly a decade before The Favourite, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos enjoyed an international breakout with this discomforting drama about a family whose young children have been kept completely away from the modern world. It's sometimes funny, frequently shocking, and impossible to forget—no matter how much you might try.\n\nLet the Fire Burn (2013)\n\nIn 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a row house occupied by members of a radical group called MOVE. Nearly a dozen occupants were killed and multiple properties were destroyed—yet the incident remained, in many ways, a local story. Let the Fire Burn chronicles the incident via remarkable archival footage and sharp editing. One of the best documentaries of the past 10 years.\n\nBeyond the Lights (2014)\n\nDirector Gina Prince-Bythewood's epic music-industry romance is the kind of smart, sumptuous grown-up movie that rarely gets made anymore. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a troubled young pop icon; Nate Parker is a cop who gets pulled into her glitzy orbit. A ridiculously catchy love story.\n\nGood Time (2017)\n\nA grimy, giddy tale of big-city desperation, starring Robert Pattinson as a greaseball charmer who robs a bank with his brother—and then spends the rest of the time trying to bail him out of jail. A little bit After Hours, a little bit Dog Day Afternoon, and definitely worth a late-night viewing.\n\nMadeline's Madeline (2018)\n\nAnchored by a trio of remarkable performances, Josephine Decker's experimental drama is enchanting, confounding, and sometimes downright difficult—in other words, everything a deeply personal indie should be. Newcomer Helena Howard—in a mesmerizing, almost mind-meldy turn—plays a young theater performer torn between her put-upon mom (Miranda July) and her increasingly invasive director (Molly Parker). As Madeline's life intensifies, so does Madeline's Madeline, in ways that are all but impossible to predict.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n",

          "description": "Welcome to Nifty, Gifty Holidays, our guide for all the little, magical ways we make the season sparkle. Today, we’re tapping a professional gift stylist for tips on perfecting our present-wrapping game.\n\nDo your presents end up wrapped in helplessly wrinkled paper and lopsided little bows? While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we can’t help but admit there’s something incredibly satisfying about handing over an impeccably wrapped gift during the holidays (and year-round!).\n\nIf you struggle to wrap presents each year—or just want to up your game to impress your friends and family—we’ve got a treat for you. Toronto-based gift stylist Corrina vanGerwen was kind enough to let us pick her brain about what it takes to create a showstopping gift, and her pro tips are pretty ingenious, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about picking wrapping paper, executing proper technique, embellishing gifts, and more.\n\nBetter Materials, Better Wrapping\n\nAs with any craft, you’ll have an easier time creating a beautiful present if you start out with high-quality materials. “Avoid paper that’s too thin, as it’s going to tear easily and just be frustrating,” explains vanGerwen. “Papers from dollar stores, for example, tend to rip, but that doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot.”\n\nSome of her go-to places for quality wrapping materials include The Paper Place, Minted, and Paper Source. Personally, I’ve had great luck with wrapping paper from Target and The Container Store, too.\n\n5 Tips to Better Wrapping\n\nOnce you’re armed with your wrapping paper, scissors and tape, it’s time to get to work. Here are vanGerwen’s top tips for an Insta-worthy present:\n\n1. Measure Your Paper\n\nThere’s such a thing as too much wrapping paper—and too little. “Paper should be large enough to wrap around the box with a little bit of overlap, plus enough overhang on either side to cover the ends of the box,” explains vanGerwen. “Too much paper gets in the way and you end up with wrinkles and bulges; too little paper and, well, you can’t cover your box.”\n\n2. Wrap It Tight!\n\nFor best results, make sure your wrapping paper is tight around the package. “It should be snug and lie flat to avoid unsightly creases, gaps and bubbles.” Personally, I find it helpful to tape the inner edge of the paper to the package so you can pull it taut as you wrap the paper around.\n\n3. Fold Exposed Edges\n\nThis next tip is ingenious, so easy and effective: \"Fold over exposed edges of paper, both along the seam at the back and at either end,\" says vanGerwen. \"This hides crooked cuts for a cleaner look.\"\n\n4. Keep It Crisp\n\nJust like your French fries, the edges of your packages should be crisp. Our gift stylist recommends using your fingernail to create sharp, defined creases.\n\n5. Hide the Tape\n\nIf you want to get really extra about your wrapping, you’re going to need some double-sided tape in your arsenal. This allows you to hide it inside, resulting in a super neat appearance. However, depending on what paper you use, double-sided tape might not stick well: “Note that double-sided tape won’t stick to some papers,” says vanGerwen, “in which case you should test both clear tape as well as invisible tape to find which one shows less.”\n\nLittle Embellishments Go a Long Way\n\nOnce your package is wrapped, it’s time to decorate. You can go with a traditional bow or combine it with another little decoration for an added touch of holiday spirit. “I like to add embellishments like bells, tree ornaments, and sprigs of greenery to make gifts festive,” says vanGerwen. Not great with ribbon? She also recommends using pretty washi tape to give your package a little extra pizazz—no bow needed.\n\nWrapping Awkward Shapes (Hint: Gift Bag Time)\n\nOkay, but what about those awkwardly-shaped items that you just don’t know what to do with? “Just put it in a box or gift bag; there’s no need to frustrate yourself by trying to get paper around a weird shape.”\n\nGift bags can be an easy way out, but at the end of the day, sometimes they’re necessary—especially if you’re pressed for time. “Don't avoid gift bags because you think it’s lazy,” she says. “Wrapping should be fun, not frustrating.” With that holiday motto in mind, it’s time to create some beautiful presents!\n\nWhat are your best tips for a well-wrapped present?

          "description": "American Airlines’ domestic fleet can be frustratingly inconsistent. While AA consistently has aircraft flying cross-country routes without power or in-flight entertainment, even in first class, you can also score lie-flat business class seats on some flights just an hour long. That’s why we at TPG dig into AA’s flight schedule every few months to let you know where you can find internationally-configured aircraft operating domestic flights.\n\nDespite this overall inconsistency, there was one route that reliably offered an internationally-configured aircraft: Miami (MIA) to/from Los Angeles (LAX) using AA’s flagship Boeing 777-300ER. However, due to schedule adjustments, that opportunity dried up back at the end of October 2017.\n\nStarting on October 4, Miami-LA got an internationally-configured aircraft once again when AA added a once-daily Boeing 777-200 to the route. Although it’s arranged as a three-class aircraft (economy, premium economy, business class), AA only opts to operate it as a two-class aircraft. This means that the lie-flat business class cabin is bookable for the standard domestic “first class” rate of 25,000 AAdvantage miles each way — without the 7,500-mile surcharge for three-class flights.\n\nB/E Aerospace Super Diamond business class on some AA Boeing 777-200 aircraft.\n\nThere are currently two versions of business class: B/E Aerospace Super Diamond or Zodiac Concept D. If you have the choice, you want the Super Diamond seats. However, the seat maps look identical, so it ends up being a roll of the dice. And either one is a huge upgrade from the standard recliner seats offered on the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737 aircraft also operating on this route:\n\nDomestic first class on AA’s Boeing 737-800.\n\nStarting June 6, 2019, American Airlines will swap the 777-200 for a daily 777-300ER flight between MIA and LAX. It’s probably not a coincidence that this is the same day that AA is adding a 777-300ER to the Los Angeles-Tokyo Haneda route. These flights will operate on the following schedule:\n\nAA 1297 — Miami (MIA) 6:50am Departure ⇒ Los Angeles (LAX) 9:05am Arrival\n\nAA 1297 — Los Angeles (LAX) 1:10pm Departure ⇒ Miami (MIA) 9:27pm Arrival\n\nWhether you get the 777-200 now or the 777-300ER starting next June, these options are a huge upgrade from the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737 aircraft on this route. On these other aircraft, chances of elites getting an upgrade isn’t great. The A321 has 16 first class seats vs. 165-171 economy seats (~10 economy seats for every first class seat) and the 737-800 has 16 first class seats vs. 144-156 economy seats (~9-10 economy seats for every first class seat).\n\nHowever, on the 777-300ER, there are a whopping 52 business class seats (not counting the 8 true first-class seats) vs. 244 economy seats — or about 5 economy seats for every business class seat. And instead of getting a reclining chair for the long cross-country flight, this upgrade will get you an excellent lie-flat business class seat.\n\nA window seat in AA’s new 777-300ER business-class cabin.\n\nThe 777-300ER is one of only two aircraft types (the other one is the “A321T”) that has a true first class cabin. This will make LA-Miami the fourth domestic route to offer a true first class cabin and service. The others are:\n\nNew York Kennedy (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX)\n\nNew York Kennedy (JFK) to San Francisco (SFO)\n\nBoston (BOS) to Los Angeles (LAX) — starting April 2019\n\nEven in economy, this aircraft is an upgrade. The 777-300ER has in-seat power and in-flight entertainment screens at each seat — which can’t be said for all flights on AA’s A321s and 737s.\n\nIn addition, American Airlines’ 777-300ER recently went through a retrofit to add a premium economy cabin, but AA isn’t trying to sell premium economy as a separate class of service on this route. That means that the premium economy seats are being coded as Main Cabin Extra — which Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum elites can select at booking for free. Even non-elites can select these seats for just $52-54 each way.\n\nLounge Access: As it currently stands, the Miami-LA route is not considered a premium transcontinental route. So, business and first class passengers won’t get access to the Flagship Lounge in Miami or Los Angeles, and first class passengers won’t get access to Flagship First Dining. TPG has asked American Airlines if this will be changed before the June 2019 launch.\n\nBooking with Points & Miles: When the 777-300ER starts next June, the flight is being sold as a three-cabin flight. On three-cabin flights, American Airlines AAdvantage levies a surcharge for business and first class over the standard award pricing. That means that the following rates will apply to this three-cabin flight:\n\nEconomy: 12,500 AAdvantage miles each way\n\nBusiness: 32,500 AAdvantage miles each way\n\nFirst Class: 50,000 AAdvantage miles each way\n\nHowever, there’s a cheaper mileage option. For example, you can book business-class awards through Alaska to pay just 25,000 Alaska miles plus $19 of taxes/fees each way.\n\nYou can stock up on Alaska miles by buying them for just 1.97 cents per mile — meaning under $500 each way for the cross-country business class flight. You can score a 30,000-mile bonus — plus the “Famous Companion Fare” — by signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature credit card.

          "description": "George H.W. Bush, whose death at 94 was announced on Friday by his family, was a hugely influential figure in the Republican Party: chairman of the Republican National Committee, vice president, president and father of another GOP president. But the GOP has changed dramatically since it nominated Bush for the presidency in 1988 — a fact reflected in the ex-president’s strained relationship with the GOP’s new standard-bearer, President Trump.\n\nSo, I think Bush’s death is another moment to highlight what my colleague Clare Malone described in the summer of 2016 as “The End Of A Republican Party.” Let’s run through some of the big shifts that have occurred within the GOP:\n\nThe GOP was once a more moderate party \n\nIdeology is complicated to measure. By some standards, the Republican Party has moved to the left. In a poll conducted last year, 42 percent of Republicans backed same-sex unions; it’s safe to assume that number was far lower during George H.W. Bush’s presidency. In 1992, one of South Carolina’s senators was Republican Strom Thurmond, who ran a 1948 presidential campaign featuring his opposition to civil rights for blacks. Today, one of South Carolina’s senators is Republican Tim Scott, who is African-American.\n\nBut by most other measures, the GOP is far more conservative than it used to be. The General Social Survey, for example, shows self-identified Republicans moving far more toward the “extremely conservative” end of its scale (as opposed to “extremely liberal”) over the past several decades.1\n\nPolitical scientists, using DW-Nominate scores,2 have concluded that the Republicans now in Congress are much further to the right of congressional Republicans in the 1970s and 1980s. And even anecdotally, figures like former House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and the late Arizona Sen. John McCain — considered solid conservatives in the George H.W. Bush era — found themselves cast as insufficiently right-wing by the party’s base in recent years.\n\nIn Bush’s era, Fox News did not exist. Deeply conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch and their allies had not created a huge network of right-wing groups that constitute basically an alternative political party. There was no tea party or House Freedom Caucus. Trump may be personally more conservative than Bush, but even if he weren’t, the forces that push a Republican president to the ideological right are stronger now than they were in the 1980s.\n\nBush himself famously signed a tax increase to help reduce the federal budget deficit, a move that angered the party’s conservative base. His two GOP successors (George W. Bush and Trump) never even really considered tax hikes, aware of the power of the party’s conservative coalition.\n\nThe GOP used to be more in line with the nation demographically\n\nTrump’s rallies include lots of older white people, as the stereotype goes. But that is the Republican Party of today. The country has become older, more diverse and more educated. The GOP, meanwhile, has grown even more disproportionately old. And while its voters grew more diverse along with the country through the 1980s (though at a bit of a lag), that shift stalled in the party in the 1990s. Same with education: The share of non-Hispanic white voters without a college degree fell throughout the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s and ’80s — in the electorate overall and the GOP. But beginning in the 1990s, it stopped falling among Republicans.\n\nIn 1992, according to the Pew Research Center, about 38 percent of registered voters who identified as Republicans were 50 years or older. By 2016, that number had grown to 58 percent. In 1992, 61 percent of Republicans were under 50, compared with 41 percent today.3\n\nRepublicans were once competitive on the coasts but weak in the South \n\nThe ideological and demographic shifts described above have corresponded with big changes in the GOP’s geographic coalition. In 1988, Bush won California — the sixth straight election in which the Republican presidential candidate carried the Golden State. Bush also won Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey and Vermont. The Republican caucus in the U.S. Senate from that era included two members from New Hampshire, two from Oregon and one from both Delaware and New York. There were zero Senate Republicans from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee.\n\nAll but one of the 16 Senate seats I just described are now held by the opposite party that controlled them in 1992, as the GOP gained ground in the South but lost power on the coasts. Trump, reflecting the growing weakness of Republicans in California, lost there in 2016 by 30 percentage points. Bush lost West Virginia in 1988 by 5 percentage points. Trump’s 42-point win in West Virginia in 2016 was his second-biggest margin in any state.4\n\nIn short, today’s Republican Party is centered in the South and almost completely out of power on the West Coast.\n\nLet me not overstate the changes in the Grand Old Party. It still loves to cut taxes, like it did in the George H.W. Bush era. It’s still overwhelmingly white. The majority of its voters are still whites without college degrees. White evangelical Protestants are still about a third of the party. It still deploys negative racial stereotypes about non-white Americans to appeal to white voters. (Remember the Willie Horton ad of the 1988 Bush campaign?)\n\nBut the changes highlighted here have dramatically altered the power dynamics in Washington. Presidents Nixon, Reagan and George H.W. Bush always had to share power with Democrats, who controlled the House from 1949 to 1994.5 But since the GOP won the House in 1994, the party has held the chamber for all but four years.6 (They won’t be in control in 2019, of course.)\n\nWhen George H.W. Bush won 53 percent of the national popular vote in 1988, it was not that remarkable. Richard Nixon had won more than 60 percent in 1972, and Ronald Reagan breached 50 percent in both 1980 and 1984. But 1988 was a watershed moment for the Republican Party — it was about to start a measurable decline in terms of its national standing. In the seven presidential elections since then (including Bush’s 1992 defeat), Republicans have won more votes nationally than Democrats just once (2004).\n\nThe tensions between Trump and the Bush family, and between Trump and McCain, speak to this broader narrative. Trump is a different kind of Republican — and he is changing the party in his image in ways they don’t like. But he is also the product of a different Republican Party than the one that the Bushes and McCain ascended in. Trump got the GOP nomination in some ways by embracing what the Republican Party had become, not what the Bushes wished it were.\n\nCORRECTION (Dec. 1, 2018, 1:30 p.m.): An earlier version of this article said President Trump’s largest margin of victory in any state in the 2016 election was in West Virginia. It was in Wyoming.\n",

          "description": "Let the luck of the Irish guide your trip to Dublin. Dublin is extremely family-friendly, so it’s no wonder TPG readers have pulled off amazing trips to Ireland — especially if they focus on the most family-friendly international carriers that can get them there using miles (or great sales). And, thankfully, once you’re in Dublin, many of the attractions kids will love charge nothing to access or enter. From the city’s Science Gallery (on one of Europe’s most esteemed college campuses, Trinity College) to the Dublin Zoo (housing animals since 1831), here’s how to soak up the Irish culture in the country’s largest city and major cultural center.\n\nBest Dublin Attractions for Little Kids\n\nFilled with green space — whether landmarks like St. Stephen’s Green or Merrion Square — Ireland’s capital offers lots of room to roam outdoors. Museums and attractions are, for the most part, kid-friendly, too, and many don’t charge an entrance fee.\n\nDublin Zoo\n\nWith 400 animals and spanning 69 acres of Phoenix Park, 3.7 miles northwest of Merrion Square, Dublin Zoo is known in the zoo community for breeding endangered species, including Rodrigues fruit bats. Admission is free at this historic zoo that has been around since 1831.\n\nWild Lights, Ireland’s award-winning night-time spectacular at the Dublin Zoo. (Photo courtesy of Dublin Zoo)\n\nCorkagh Park\n\nNot only is the 300-acre Corkagh Park in South Dublin a green space with a playground, fishing and fairy trails, but it’s also an animal-petting zoo with no charge to enter. During the early summer, the rose garden is in bloom, providing amazing photo ops for the family. There are also birds you can visit in a special aviary section of the park.\n\nThe Corkagh Park Rose Garden. (Photo by Liam Flag via Wikipedia Commons)\n\nMerrion Square\n\nTo help work through the kinks of jet lag or allow toddlers enough room to simply roam, don’t leave Dublin without a stroll through Merrion Square, located in the city center. On the west side of the park is a children’s playground and on the east side, a snack stand that also serves beverages. Kids like to experience the park as a self-guided activity, using this guide that includes finding, and then drawing, sharing or taking a photo of certain items. One of Ireland’s most famed writers — Oscar Wilde — has a trio of statues in his honor that were established in 1997 by sculptor Danny Osborne. There is no cost to enter the park.\n\nA fair in Merrion Square in Dublin. (Photo via Shutterstock)\n\nColored Doors on Leeson Street\n\nIf you’ve got a chunk of time to fill but the family is still restless, walk on Lower Leeson Street, three blocks southeast of St. Stephen’s Green, a public park. You’ve likely seen images of these brightly colored doors in photos, but seeing the vividness in person is a treat. And, if you’re craving tea or a snack, the darling House Dublin’s café (offering both indoor and outdoor seating) is the perfect stop. \n\n(Photo by Robert Anasch via Unsplash)\n\nDublin Attractions for Tweens\n\nWith its rich history in literature and music, Ireland’s cultural capital is poised to easily reach tweens as a gateway to learning even more about the country’s history.\n\nNatural History Museum\n\nTweens love the “Dead Zoo” at the National Museum of Ireland, which refers to the admission-free Natural History Museum. Located on Merrion Street, the museum houses cabinets filled with species that are no longer with us, including skeletons of Irish deer and a 65-foot-long whale skeleton hanging from the roof.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Dublin’s Natural Museum of History)\n\nLiterary Pub Crawl\n\nYou might be thinking that a pub crawl is not a kid-friendly activity, but Dublin is not your average pub scene. In Dublin, everybody goes to the pub — considered an extension of one’s living room — and the food menus are hearty. For the literary pub crawl (14 euros/$16 each and does not include beer), professional actors take a group to four or five pubs within a few blocks’ radius, starting at The Duke Pub, and re-enact scenes from the writings of famous Irish poets and playwrights, including Samuel Beckett and James Joyce.\n\nNational Botanic Gardens of Ireland\n\nWhile many cities charge an arm and a leg to access its botanical gardens, the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland is free. Located a little under 2 miles from the city center, this paradise is easy to reach by public transit via the 4, 9 or 83 buses. Of special interest is a fruit and vegetable garden, filled with Irish apple varietals; and tropical plants typically grown around the world thrive inside The Great Palm House. Kid-specific activities include the Viking House (information about what Vikings grew, wore and ate) and a tropical rainforest (the only one in Ireland) located inside the Great Palm House.\n\nThe National Botanic Gardens of Ireland in Dublin.

This isn’t your typical science museum because the targeted demographic is teens and those in their young 20s. Also, instead of a museum with permanent exhibits, it operates via temporary shows (around 40 to date).\n\nTrinity Science Gallery, Dublin (Photo by Julien Behal/PA Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe National Gallery of Ireland\n\nIf you’re used to plunking down $20–$25 per member of your family to spend a day at the art museum, you’ll love that The National Gallery of Ireland (focused on art between the 14th and 20th centuries) is free to enter. It’s conveniently located in the city center, a half-block northwest of Merrion Square. If you can manage to visit on a Sunday, this is Family Day. On Family Day the gallery introduces special kid-friendly tours, activities and sessions (all drop-in, no sign-up required) plus art-creation in the new Maples and Calder Creative Space, launched earlier this year. If your teen is already into art, and wants to explore on his or her own (as opposed to in a group with younger kids), consider checking out a free art pack and audio guide from the information desk.\n\nThe National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. (Photo via Shutterstock)\n\nBook of Kells and Old Library Tour at Trinity College\n\nWhile it’s free to stroll the Trinity College campus — just immediately across from the city center — you can “splurge” a bit by folding in some education. It costs just 28 euros ($32) for an entire family (children under 12 are free) to tour the Old Library, which dates back to the 18th century, as well as view the Book of Kells, the first four gospels of the New Testament written in Latin around 800 AD. Sign up for a tour here.\n\nThe Long Room at Trinity College (Photo by Aitormmfoto / Getty Images)\n\nRent Dublinbikes\n\nIf it’s a nice day and you’re comfortable with the lay of the land, renting bicycles through Dublinbikes (a shared-bicycle company) is a fun activity after you’ve crossed off all of the other must-sees in Dublin on your list. Bike rentals cost 5 euros ($6) for a three-day ticket. To rent a bike, just approach one of the stations in Dublin’s city center (each has about 15 bikes).\n\nDublin bikes along the Liffey River in Dublin. (Photo via Shutterstock)\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf language is a concern when traveling to Europe, Dublin’s locals speak English, but more importantly, they are such warm, kind and laid-back people that immersion takes no time at all. With world-class museums celebrating the arts and sciences, walkable neighborhoods (you don’t need a car here, nor do you have to travel underground often like you might in Paris or London) and easily accessible cultural icons (from Irish music and dancing to Dublin’s famous colored doors), your kids will definitely remember their trip to Dublin.\n\nTo continue your Dublin trip planning:\n\nUse Points and Miles to Travel to Dublin for St. Patrick’s Day\n\nGuide to Booking Aer Lingus Award Flights\n\nAer Lingus Business Class Review\n\nReview of the Westin Dublin\n\nHow to Spend an Overnight Layover in Dublin\n\nTrip-Spiration: Explore Ireland\n\nFeatured images by David Soanes Photography / Getty Images\n",

          "description": "The streets of Little Senegal in Harlem, New York and the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood in Minneapolis share a common trait: they are both home to thriving African immigrant communities from west and east Africa, many of whom practice Islam. From halal meat stores to restaurants, fabric stores and shops selling religious articles, these buzzing enclaves offer a telling portrait of Islam in America.\n\nMore than any other issue, immigration is the one factor that has defined the diversity and demographics of the US Muslim population. With a total of about 3.45 million people or 1% of the US population, three-quarters of Muslims in the United States are first-generation Americans who were born in another country, according to the Pew Research Center. Most of these immigrants and their children come mostly from countries in the Middle East and South Asia like Pakistan, India, and Iraq. But they also come from all across Africa, gain an education at higher rates, and eventually serve in the highest echelons of politics, science, and business worlds.\n\nSome of the stories of these inspiring individuals are captured in the newly-published book I, Too, Am America. The collection of 50 stories by the veteran journalist Lekan Oguntoyinbo, celebrate the journeys and the remarkable contributions of Muslims—both African and otherwise—to the advancement of the United States. The book’s title is a play on the Langston Hughes poem I, Too, which affirms the concept of patriotism and captures a hankering for equality through diligence and resolve.\n\nMarathoner Khalid Khannouchi\n\nThe book’s publication comes as both Muslims and Africans in America face greater scrutiny and increasing hostility in the form of violence. President Trump, who has retweeted anti-Muslim videos from a British far-right group, has also instituted a travel ban that includes Muslim-majority African states like Somalia and Libya. His administration has also deported a record number of Africans from Senegal and Ghana in the west to Egypt and Morocco in the north.\n\nFollowing the 9/11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent war on terror, Muslims have grappled with their place in American society and have faced backlash on issues ranging from their patriotism to whether they could construct places of worship\n\nDr. Nawal Nour\n\nIn the face of all this, Muslims continue to defy the odds and are increasingly becoming a visible and important tapestry in communities across the US. This month, a former Somali refugee Ilhan Omar became one of two first Muslim women elected to Congress, an election win that many Somali candidates replicated in the state of Minnesota. Yet the current wins aren’t void of Islam’s roots in America, which dates back to the 16th century: way ahead of the Transatlantic slave trade and the arrival of shackled Africans from present-day West Africa.\n\nPhysician, scientist, radiologist and biomedical engineer Elias Zerhouni\n\nBeyond politics, African Muslims have served in industries as diverse as journalism, medicine, law, and scientific research. There’s Mohamed El-Erian, originally from Egypt, who is the chief economic advisor of at Allianz SE, the parent company of Pimco which he successfully headed between 2007 and 2014. There’s Khalid Khannouchi from Morocco, who once scrubbed dishes in Brooklyn but rose to set world records in marathons.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz\n\nThere’s Nawal Nour from Sudan, credited with creating the first clinic to address female genital mutilation in the United States. Elias Zerhouni, born in Algeria, was a director at the National Institutes of Health and served as one of the first two science envoys appointed by Obama. The distinguished poet Khaled Mattawa from Libya has been lauded for exploring the intersection of culture, narrative, and memory. And there’s singer Akon, born to a musical family from Senegal, who later nurtured his global music career.\n\nSpace scientist Farouk El-Baz\n\nDespite its brevity, Oguntoyinbo’s book stands as a primer on Islam in modern-day America. It acts to prove what theologians like Amir Hussain asserted: “There has never been an America without Muslims.”\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.\n",

If you use an iPhone to ask Siri how old Donald Trump is, you’ll be greeted with a picture of a penis instead of a photo of the President. At the time of writing, the penis picture keeps coming and going. Presumably, someone is editing the Wikipedia page associated with Donald Trump, or gaming the algorithm that Siri uses to source images.\n\nEither way, it’s an odd bug that has created various incorrect answers in the past. The most memorable Siri fail was when it erroneously thought the Bulgarian national anthem was Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” before Apple quickly fixed the result. There’s a whole subreddit dedicated to daily examples of Siri acting crazy, but today’s failure is particularly surprising given it’s Thanksgiving in the US. Today is probably not a good day to ask Siri about Donald Trump in front of the family dinner table.\n\nA Wikipedia editor, speaking to The Verge over direct message, confirmed it was indeed vandalism at play, and from more than one editor. “They have now been blocked indefinitely,” the editor tells us. You can also observe the pubic Wikipedia edit history for Trump’s page to see the back and forth edit war. \n\nUpdate 11/22, 6:05PM ET: Added comment from an editor of Wikipedia confirming the vandalism and informing us that the rogue editors have been blocked.

          "description": "Earlier this year, I asked a friend to dog-sit for us while my family was on vacation. I lured her in with the promise of access to our fully-equipped smart house. She could peruse the full extent of my Apple Music subscription on our Sonos, or watch Netflix on our Apple TV. She could fiddle with the Hue lights. She could even start the robot vacuum, if she wanted! No pressure or anything.\n\nThat afternoon, I got a call. I had accidentally packed the iPad mini, which serves as our house’s smart control panel. Without it, she couldn’t use... well, anything. In retrospect, we were lucky that she was even able to operate the front door.\n\nIf you have a smart home, you most likely control it with your smartphone or personal tablet. Toggling between multiple apps is annoying, and so is sitting in your house for anyone who isn't you. The concept behind tech start-up Brilliant is therefore—excuse me here—brilliant. It takes control of your smart house out of your pocket and drills it into the wall with a panel that anyone can use.\n\nThe Brilliant panel is a simple computer, rather than an upgraded smart switch. In addition to providing Amazon Alexa services when connected to your Amazon account, it has a microphone, a camera, a motion detector, and an alarm. It integrates an astonishing number of smart home devices, like the Nest and Ecobee thermostats, the Ring doorbell, the Phillips Hue bulbs, and Sonos speakers.\n\nI was excited to test the Brilliant two switch panel (Brilliant also offers one-, three-, and four-switch panel configurations). At the moment, it’s still a little too clunky to substitute for my iPad, but I’m optimistic that that will change in the very near future.\n\nLight Bright\n\nThe two-switch panel is 4.76 inches wide and 5.3 inches tall, with an LCD touch screen that has 720 x 1280 resolution and two indented sliders that work as dimmers. It’s only a little bigger than a regular light switch panel. I chose to install the Brilliant by my front door. You need a 120-volt double switch gang box that is grounded and wired in compliance with National Electric Code.\n\nThat's easy enough; a double switch gang box and compliant wiring is what you find when you unscrew the panel for most double light switches. And when I watched Brilliant’s clear and simple installation video, installation seemed easy. But when I unscrewed our panel, a rat’s nest of cords popped out at me. My husband rewired our house himself, and I needed to enlist his help to figure out which cord was what.\n\nShutting off the breaker and manipulating live wires isn’t hard, but it is nerve-wracking, and I was grateful to be able to do it with someone who had done it before without burning our house down (yet). For anyone who doesn't have experience with electrical wiring, Brilliant will soon be announcing an installation service. A licensed electrician will come install one panel for you, starting at $199, with tiered pricing for multiple panels.\n\nThe Brilliant has both Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth capabilities. Once installed and online, the possibilities made me a little giddy. I downloaded the Brilliant app, where, obviously, the first order of business was to upload pictures of my kids from my camera roll to roll continuously whenever the Brilliant was on. I also linked the Brilliant to my Amazon account so I could use Alexa. The panel walked me through how to do it.\n\nAdding our smart home devices to the Brilliant was annoying, in ways that were both predictable and unexpected. In theory, it’s as simple as touching the panel, selecting a room, and tapping the Add Device button. I did predict, and dread, the tedious back-and-forth between my husband and me as we tried to remember who had registered for what device, which email address they'd used, and what all the long-forgotten passwords were.\n\nBut I had other snafus. The Hue lights and Sonos didn’t show up immediately, so I reset the router. That brought the Hue lights online, but to get the Sonos, I had to contact the team at Brilliant. They said they'd discovered a bug with the Sonos's new API and rolled out an update that evening. The Nest didn't show up, either. Although Brilliant says that any user can connect to any Nest thermostat, their director of product management did have to send me an email that let me log into my Nest account, in order to authorize the Brilliant to access it.\n\nOnce all the devices are on the Brilliant, you can’t use all of their functions. For example, I can turn my Sonos on and off, but I can only play selections from albums or playlists that I’ve already added to My Sonos. Likewise, I can turn my Hue lights on and off, and dim or brighten them, but I can’t tinker with the colors.\n\nThe app doesn’t always sync with the control panel either. I can’t add new devices via the app, and I also can’t find the Hue or Sonos. It’s not especially irritating, considering that I can always control those via their original apps on my phone. Plus, my Sonos sounds much better than the Brilliant's speaker.\n\nTinker, Tailor\n\nI’m not surprised that there are a lot of kinks to work out with the Brilliant, since it's a relatively new product that comes packed full of functions. For example, the panel has a camera and microphone, so that you can speak to other Brilliant panels via intercom; I thought briefly about installing it in my husband’s workshop behind or house, but the electrical wiring situation is even hairier out there. The camera also has a tiny sliding panel to cover the lens for privacy.\n\nThe Brilliant also has a motion detector, which has a range of 8 to 15 feet, and you can toggle the motion sensors on and off. I set the display to turn on dim lights whenever the Brilliant detected motion, which is convenient for when I stumble into the living room at 6 am, bleary-eyed and holding two kids. I also told the Brilliant to turn the lights off if it didn’t detect motion after 30 minutes.\n\nYou can also set customizable scenes. I created one that starts automatically after my kids' bedtime, which dims all the lights and starts playing a Pandora station on low. I also set a timer for the porch light, which turns it off at 10 pm. You can also set alarms. The Brilliant rings a surprisingly pleasant-sounding chime, which I use to remind my kids that we have to leave for preschool right this second.\n\nAnd of course, with Alexa enabled, you can do all the usual Alexa things, like ask for the weather forecast or get a refresher on Mary, Queen of Scots. Not only does Alexa answer you, but visuals—like the ten-day forecast, or written explanations—also appear on the Brilliant screen. If you want to control the devices that the Brilliant controls through Alexa, you also have to enable the Alexa Skill. The Brilliant app walks you through it.\n\nScreen Time\n\nThe Brilliant brilliantly (sorry, but you can’t stop me!) filled a gap in the smart home market. I find the mini iPad to be pretty convenient, but I know our dog-sitters and baby-sitters find it a little annoying, and possibly a little intrusive. After all, I also use it to watch videos and browse the Internet. As much as I trust my friends, babysitters, dog-sitters, and house-sitters, I always wonder if they have to fight an urge to check my calendar or order 300 cinnamon raisin bagels when I leave my iPad at home.\n\nThe Brilliant isn't perfect. It's expensive, and hard to install, when compared to, say, an Echo Show. But for all the random quirks that come with a relatively recent product—like, say, accidentally turning off my Hue lights with another switch and then having the Brilliant tell me that it couldn't find them—it was so easy to imagine how easy and convenient it would be, once a lot of the bugs were worked out.\n\nI kept finding the Brilliant unexpectedly delightful. I loved catching glimpses of my kids as I walked out of the house. My \"kids are in bed\" scene startled my husband into cracking open a bottle of wine. The panel does get the most important things right: It manages your home devices, and nothing more. And you can't accidentally take it with you on vacation.\n",

          "description": "Of all my memories of that summer in Peru—drinking pisco in the desert, finding a mummified baby, unwrapping it under less than scientifically optimal conditions— the one that stands out most is the memory of my first lucid dream. At 9 o’clock, I climbed into the bottom bunk and curled up in my sleeping bag, worn out from physical exertion and the monotony of digging. I set my alarm for 5 am and drifted off almost immediately, my body too tired to let my mind wander down its usual anxiety-laden paths.\n\nAnd then, the scene changed. It was a summer afternoon—not the Andean summer, with its thin warmth and cloudy nights, but a real summer, the kind of heat so extravagant you jump in the water and dry off in the sun. I soaked up the warmth I’d been craving, treading water in some bucolic pool I’d never seen before. I don’t particularly like swimming in real life; I don’t like exercising in any form without the distraction of podcasts or Pandora. But this was different—effortless\nand sensual. I had a heightened awareness of every part of my body, the physicality of the cool water and the bright air and a surreal forest enclosing the pool in magnificent foliage. I woke up euphoric.\n\nThe memory had none of the haziness that usually clouds dreams, and the details remain perfectly crisp years later. But I wasn’t just elated; the whole thing was also vaguely disturbing. I hadn’t been in my sleeping bag in a dusty dormitory in Peru—I had been transported to some faraway place, and I preferred it there. My jaunt in the pool had shaken my sense of what was real, and I couldn’t explain it without sounding crazy. All I knew was that I wanted to do it again.\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\n\nI spent the rest of the summer practicing tips from a secondhand copy of Stephen LaBerge’s Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. I repeated LaBerge’s mantra ad nauseam: “Tonight, I will have a lucid dream.” I made up mantras of my own: “Tonight, I will fly to the moon.”\n\nNo one had done more to advance lucid dreaming than Stephen LaBerge. He is to lucid dreaming what Louis Pasteur is to pasteurization, Thomas Edison to electricity. In spite of his discoveries, LaBerge failed to attract much attention from the scientific establishment. Lucid dreaming didn’t seem likely to cure cancer, after all; it was thought of as weird, nonessential, if it was thought of at all. Instead of devoting himself to research, he had to find a way to make money. He set up a private company called the Lucidity Institute and began writing primers on lucid dreaming—like the one I found in Peru.\n\nI learned to recognize the signs that I was dreaming, like finding myself flying or meeting dead people. Every couple of hours, I would do what LaBerge called a reality test, asking myself if I was awake or asleep—a trick that, once ingrained, LaBerge promised would trigger lucidity. I’d had lucid dreams on occasion, but couldn’t predict when they would come; I got lazy about my reality tests, and I didn’t always make time to meditate. Sleep was precious; waking myself up in the middle of the night was out of the question.\n\nYet the more I learned about the power of lucid dreaming, the more I wanted to be able to induce lucid dreams on a consistent basis. I wanted to learn from Stephen LaBerge himself.\n\nOn a hot, humid day in September, I flew into Hawaii’s tiny Hilo airport to find a bleary-eyed group already gathering. My fellow lucid dream enthusiasts had picked one another out without too much trouble; they were the ones milling around sheepishly, looking a little rumpled, a little apprehensive, not quite sure what they had signed up for. I joined them and we waited for the shuttle, exhausting the browsing potential of the kitschy gift shop with its cheap leis and turquoise hoodies, swapping names and dreaming résumés.\n\nThe whole district of Puna has a history as a magnet for seekers and searchers, a respite for pilgrims fleeing the pressures of modern life. Hippie co-ops and intentional communities are dotted across the area. So-called Punatics wander the black-sand beaches in dreadlocks and ratty clothes and loiter in the hot springs, smoking.\n\nNatalie showed me to my room, a simple dormitory-like space with hokey pastoral paintings on the walls, a few pieces of wicker furniture, and little else. The primary source of light was a single bare bulb on the why-we-dream ceiling, but the electricity was out that night. I stumbled around with the tiny flashlight on my key ring and passed out.\n\nWhen I drew back the flimsy curtains in the morning, I took in the scene properly for the first time. From my window, I could see luscious palm trees and tall tropical grasses misted over by a layer of fresh dew. My first thought was that the landscape resembled a desktop background come to life.\n\nIn the morning, we convened in a bright, airy structure on top of a hill, one side opening directly onto the rainforest. Knotted scarves hung from the window frames, and a portrait of the volcano goddess Pele, painted in fiery primary colors, dominated one of the eight walls. (I have never found four-walled rooms particularly stifling, but this space had been designed, according to the promotional literature, to liberate visitors from “box-based architecture.”)\n\nLaBerge's assistant, Kristen—a clinical psychologist and master lucid dreamer, with the pun-embossed T-shirts and upbeat mien of a camp counselor—regaled us with tales of her lucid adventures. Kristen taught herself to induce lucid dreams in college after she learned about the phenomenon in a psychology class. “I couldn’t believe it wasn’t a commonly known thing,” she said. “I was just so in awe.” She had since trained herself to become lucid as often as three times a week and could even meditate and practice yoga in the dream state. She was outlining our curriculum for the week when she was interrupted by a low-pitched masculine shout.\n\n“What are we doing here?” bellowed a barefoot man in a baggy Hawaiian shirt and shorts, bright blue eyes peering out from beneath bushy white eyebrows. Stephen must have slipped in through the back door while Kristen was talking; I had missed his entrance. His voice swung theatrically; each question began as a rumble and ended as a squeal.\n\n“What is this all about?” he demanded. “How do I know you’re people? Maybe you’re robots or aliens or dream figures. Does anybody think that it really might be a dream?”\n\nThis barrage of questions was a fitting introduction; Stephen would spend much of the coming week training us to pay closer attention to our surroundings, to scrutinize the details of our environment, to search for incongruities and stop assuming that we were awake. He greeted us one by one, mustering an impressive show of curiosity over each person’s individual path. At 69, he had devoted the better part of his life to lucid dreams, and it was “revivifying,” he said, “to be with people who find the topic intriguing.”\n\nStephen was intense in a way that a sympathetic observer might describe as cerebral; a less generous one might have characterized him as awkward, even manic. He was constantly in motion even when he was sitting, contorting his body this way and that, crossing and uncrossing his ankles. When he got excited—which was often—he jumped out of his chair. His gesticulations sometimes devolved into jazz hands, and his voice could cover several octaves in a single sentence. More than once, I heard his manner likened to that of a wizard.\n\nLucid dreaming has been slowly gaining prominence in recent years. The release of Christopher Nolan’s 2010 science-fiction blockbuster Inception— in which corporate spies sneak into their marks’ dreams to steal their secrets and implant bad ideas — was a landmark moment. (The spies use a top as a tool for reality tests; if it spins indefinitely, then they know they are in the dream state; if it falls, they are awake.) Nolan said that the film was inspired by his own experience of lucid dreaming and that its ambiguous ending—the camera lingers on a spinning top, leaving viewers to wonder whether or not it will fall—should be taken to mean that “perhaps all levels of reality are valid.” Google searches for \"lucid dreaming\" spiked around the movie’s release and have never returned to pre-2010 levels. And the internet, of course, has helped. A constantly updated Lucid Dreaming forum on Reddit has accumulated more than 190,000 subscribers.\n\nStill, lucid dreaming has not exactly permeated the culture. Our contemporary neglect of our dream lives is not only a historical anomaly, but a particular paradox. People are obsessed with hearing the latest research on sleep, even if scientists haven’t yet reached a consensus on why we pass out every night. We want to know how screens and modern scheduling affect our sleep patterns. We click on studies warning us that anything less than eight hours of sleep destroys our health, looks, and happiness—or promising that six hours is enough or that some people are fine with just three or four.\n\nMeanwhile, we chart, track, and optimize our time, buying Fitbits and phone apps to count the minutes spent on exercise, work, and hobbies; we suffer from “fear of missing out.” Yet in ignoring our dreams, we squander an opportunity to experience adventure and boost our mental health, about five or six years’ worth of opportunity (20 to 25 percent of total time asleep) over the course of an average lifetime.\n\nSleep is usually discussed as a means to an end—a tool to ensure the daytime is productive, to improve memory, regulate metabolism, and keep the immune system in order. But as LaBerge asked: “If you must sleep through a third of your life, as it seems you must, are you willing to sleep through your dreams too?”\n\nBy the end of his painstaking period of trial and error as a student at Stanford, not only had LaBerge created a powerful system that let him lucid dream whenever he wanted, but also it worked for other people too. The core of his method, the sine qua non, is what he calls the reality test. Aspiring lucid dreamers should make a habit of asking ourselves at regular intervals throughout the day whether we are awake or asleep. Because daytime routines work their way into dreams, we should pose the same question in our sleep. If we are sufficiently attuned, we will respond that we are asleep, and a lucid dream will commence.\n\nEffective reality tests entail reorienting yourself in the world, cultivating a skeptical outlook toward your environment. Is everything as it should be? Look for clues that your surroundings might not be real. Inspect your hands: Does each one have the usual number of fingers? Check the clock, and check it again: Has a reasonable amount of time elapsed? Find a shiny surface: Are you reflected back as you really are, or are you distorted, as though you’re looking in a funhouse mirror? Jump up in the air: Do you drop back to the ground, or have you suddenly acquired the ability to fly? The dream world is constantly in flux; check whether your environment is stable. Exit a scene and then return to it. Are you in a different room? Find a piece of text—the spine of a book, a word on a bracelet, an email—look away from it, and then look back. If you’re in a dream, the words are likely to have changed by the second inspection.\n\nStephen demonstrated a reality test: “Does anybody think that this might be a dream?”\n\nSilence; we glanced sideways at one another, like students taken aback by a pop quiz.\n\n“Are you sure you’re not going to wake up in bed in another 10 minutes or an hour?”\n\nTentative nods of assent.\n\n“But how do you know?” he asked. “What is the evidence for that assumption?”\n\n“I can’t float,” one brave guy called out. He was sitting motionless in his chair.\n\n“You call that trying?” Stephen shouted. His incredulity was melodramatic, his voice rising in a show of outrage. “That’s not a real effort!” Stephen straightened his back as though trying to levitate out of his chair, his face crumpling with the strain of his imagined effort. He jumped up, his eyes widening as if in hope. But he dropped back down into his seat; he could not float.\n\nHe was awake, and he had conveyed his point. A proper reality test entails truly considering, with your body as well as your mind, the possibility that you are in a dream.\n\nLaBerge didn’t start leading retreats just to pay the bills or even to share the joys of lucid dreaming. The workshops have also provided him with a way to move his own research ahead. They have given him access to a group of people who are willing to participate in his studies, even if they aren’t certified by a lab.\n\nThis year, that tradition continued. On three consecutive nights, those of us who agreed to take part in what LaBerge cryptically called “the experiment” were given plastic bags of unmarked, oversize capsules and instructions to swallow them after our third REM period, meditate, or write in our dream journals for 30 to 60 minutes, and go back to sleep. The three packets contained one set of placebo pills and two of galantamine, a drug developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease. (It’s available both over the counter and as an FDA-regulated prescription.) Alzheimer’s patients suffer from low levels of neurons that respond to acetylcholine, a chemical that sends signals between nerve cells; the imbalance can contribute to their lapses in memory. Galantamine—one of a number of drugs classified as cholinesterase inhibitors—works by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain. Bizarre dreams are a side effect; galantamine reduces “REM sleep latency,” the time between sleep onset and the first REM stage, and increases “REM density,” a measure of frequency of eye movement that corresponds to dream intensity.\n\nGalantamine should enhance mental clarity in the dream state in the same way that it improves memory in dementia patients. Over the years, LaBerge has served different doses of galantamine and other cholinesterase inhibitors to over 100 aspiring lucid dreamers. His results are promising; he has found that people who are already proficient lucid dreamers are five times more likely to become lucid on the nights they take galantamine than on the nights they take a placebo. Even without yet publishing these findings in a peer-reviewed journal, LaBerge has—thanks to presentations at IASD and word of mouth—helped set off a wave of formal and informal research, stimulating the market for lucid-dreaming supplements with names like Galantamind. Online lucid-dreaming boards are teeming with inspirational stories of galantamine-assisted success. “The first night I took it I had one lucid dream after another,” wrote a member of the World of Lucid Dreaming Forum. “Most of the times I take it, I have outstanding dreams—often flying dreams and amazing journeys that blow my mind,” another attested. One researcher surveyed 19 lucid dreamers who incorporated galantamine into their routines and found qualitative differences in the way they described their drug-fueled lucid dreams: They were more vivid, longer, and more stable than usual.\n\nGalantamine is not a magic bullet, though; it can trigger nasty side effects like headaches, nausea, and insomnia. And it can work too well—cautionary tales of galantamine-induced nightmares can be found alongside success stories. “It felt like my brain was being drawn and quartered,” one lucid dreamer wrote. “I kept falling back asleep into these bizarre dreams that I can only describe as my head being scraped against the bottom of a submerged iceberg.” “It felt like I was falling through my bed and all these loud screeching sounds and vibrations started happening,” testified another. “It was so scary and I felt paralyzed.”\n\nThe day after our experiment began, a few people turned up to the morning lecture looking haggard and complaining that they hadn’t been able to fall back to sleep after taking their pills; one had spent the night vomiting. For me, galantamine did the trick. On both of the nights that I took it, I had lucid dreams, and no trouble falling back to sleep. When I took what I later found out was a placebo, I could recall only a mundane, nonlucid anxiety dream in which I found out that an acquaintance was also working on a book about the science of dreams. What I think was more helpful than galantamine, though, was the fact of being on the retreat—in a place where I didn’t have to think about everyday things and where I was surrounded by people who shared my goals. I don’t think it was a coincidence that my first lucid dreams in Peru came at another time when I was able to maintain a single-minded focus on my desire to become lucid, and when I had made dream talk a regular part of my day.\n\nScientists are finding powerful applications of lucid dreaming for intellectual as well as therapeutic and clinical problems. “If you want to study subjective experiences and their neural correlates, dreams are an excellent means to do that,” said Katja Valli, a neuroscientist at the University of Turku in Finland. She believes that pinpointing the neural differences among dreamless sleep, dreams, and lucid dreams could shed light on the cognitive basis of consciousness itself.\n\nLucid dreaming can also help people with common mental disorders like anxiety. Line Salvesen has been both an anxious person and an effortless lucid dreamer for almost as long as she can remember. As a child, she suffered from recurring nightmares and realized that she could escape from them if she recognized that she was in a dream. In one, she would be riding in the back seat of a car when all of a sudden, her parents, who were driving, would vanish. The car would hurtle down the road, toddler Line powerless in the back, until it crashed. She figured out that she could wake herself up, which helped, but it was only after she taught herself to seize control that she was able to banish the nightmare for good. One night, after her parents disappeared as usual, Line consciously formulated a new plan: She would summon her kindergarten classmates to steer the car. “They were in the driver’s seat, and they helped each other,” she said. “It wasn’t really a nightmare anymore.”\n\nIt wasn’t until reading an article about lucid dreaming in a magazine that Line—who was having lucid dreams almost every night—realized that not everyone was conscious in dreams. “It said that only a small fraction of people are able to have these naturally, and I was like ‘I’m special?’ ” She laughed. The habit that was as intuitive for her as breathing, she learned, was an elusive goal for others.\n\nIn spite of her special skill, Line suffered from overwhelming anxiety in her teens and early twenties. “I felt stressed all the time,” she told me. “I didn’t feel that I had any control.” She tried therapy and medication, but nothing worked. “It made life pretty hard,” she said. “It ruined my senior year in high school.” She missed classes because she was so tired—even though she was sleeping 12 hours a night—and her grades plummeted. She took sick leave from her first job to undergo more intensive treatment.\n\nUntil Line met lucid dreaming expert Robert Waggoner in a cyber-dreaming conference, she had mostly used her lucid dreams for fun, but Waggoner suggested they might hold the key to solving her anxiety. The next time she became lucid, she followed his advice. “I told myself that I would be happy and anxiety-free for one week. I just said it out loud in the dream, with confidence.” When she woke up, she could feel that something had changed inside her. “It was like my anxiety was just turned off. I was ecstatic.” Her therapist could scarcely believe her overnight transformation. “I came into his office, and he could just see that I was different. When I told him what I did, he almost fell out of his chair.” Her new sense of composure lasted, and when it began to fade, she just repeated her mantra in her next lucid dream. She still suffers the occasional panic attack, but her anxiety has never returned in full force.\n\nSports scientists, meanwhile, have latched onto lucid dreaming as a tool in performance and exercise. In a series of experiments in the 2010s, Michael Schredl and Daniel Erlacher had lucid dreamers try to use their dreams to improve at physical tasks. In one study, 40 people tried to toss a coin into a cup about 6 feet away. Afterward, one group was allowed to practice, another group tried to incubate lucid dreams about the coin toss, and a control group did nothing. When everyone attempted the task again, the people who had dreamed about it improved their hit rate by 43 percent, compared with just 4 percent for the control group. (Practicing while awake, though, was the most effective strategy.)\n\nRecent research has vindicated much of LaBerge's early work, but he is hardly bitter about the academic career he could have had. His books are still selling. His fans are ardent, his workshops well attended. Perhaps the spiritual experiences he has had in the dream state tempered his ambition. In one lucid dream, which Stephen spent about half an hour recounting, he floated into a sky stippled with religious symbols and experienced a sense of oneness with the natural world as his body dissolved into a “point of awareness.” He woke with his fear of death diminished. Lucid dreams have done enough for him.\n\nExcerpted from Why We Dream: The Transformative Power of Our Nightly Journey by Alice Robb. Copyright © 2018 by Alice Robb.

          "description": "One Thursday last month, 19-year-old Robbie Barrat woke to a fusillade of messages on his phone. “I was half asleep but saw they all contained the same number,” he says. “Then I fell back asleep for a few hours. I didn’t really want to believe.”\n\nThe number in those messages was $432,500—the winning bid at Christie’s New York on a ghostly portrait created using artificial intelligence, following a recipe Barrat posted online not long after graduating high school. Barrat was shocked, because Christie’s had previously estimated the portrait would sell for $7,000 to $10,000. He already felt ripped off by the sale, because he wasn’t credited. He probably won’t receive a cent.\n\nEdmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy, as the portrait is called, was created by a Parisian art collective that goes by the name Obvious. It appears to have made only minor tweaks to Barrat’s methodology to produce the portrait. The incident has triggered a debate about authorship and ethics in the nascent field of AI art.\n\nObvious and Christie’s did not respond to requests for comment. Barrat says he posted his code to help and inspire others but that Obvious went too far by profiting from re-creating his work. “It’s a very awful situation,” he says.\n\nBarrat and some sympathizers in the small world of AI art are also disappointed that their rapidly evolving movement’s first big flash of public attention revolved around what they consider a derivative work, far from the field’s cutting edge. “People have been doing nearly identical stuff since 2016,” Barrat says. Adds Marian Mazzone, an art historian who studies AI art at College of Charleston: “It doesn’t look like they did anything very new or interesting with what they took.”\n\nPeople have made art with computers for more than 50 years. Barrat and Obvious are part of a recent movement of creative coding piggybacking on the hottest technology in Silicon Valley.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and other tech companies have turned an area of AI research known as machine learning into an intensely competitive arena. The technology lets computers figure out tasks like recognizing objects in images for themselves by digesting example data. A rejuvenated technique called neural networks has given the approach impressive new power. While corporate labs direct that power to uses such as helping autonomous cars navigate traffic, some artists direct it to generate images.\n\nBarrat got into that world via an unconventional route. He’s part of a blooming scene of self-taught AI experts enabled by open source tools from corporate AI labs. Barrat taught himself to code, and work with neural networks, in his bedroom in rural West Virginia, where his first machine learning project involved training software to generate rap lyrics in the style of Kanye West.\n\nA landscape generated by Robbie Barrat's neural network.\n\nRobbie Barrat\n\nBarrat’s adventures in visual AI art are built on a technique known as Generative Adversarial Networks, invented by Ian Goodfellow, a researcher now at Google. It involves setting up a duel between two neural networks looking at the same collection of images. One network tries to generate fake images that could blend in with the originals, the other tries to spot any fakes. Over many rounds of competition, the fake-generating network can get good enough to make fakes that can fool a human.\n\nThe network that created Edmond de Belamy originated in a 2016 research paper from researchers at Facebook and Boston startup Indico. They described a new implementation of the technique called DCGAN and showed that after processing millions of photos it could generate imperfect but recognizable images of bedrooms and faces that never existed.\n\nBarrat adapted DCGAN to artistic ends—ultimately enabling Obvious’ big win—by training it on centuries of art history. He wrote a script to scrape images of different styles or genres of art from WikiArt, an online encyclopedia with more than 250,000 images. Using those images, he then trained networks to generate landscapes, portraits, and surreal nudes. He posted a Github project that provides everything you need to replicate his workflow and even included some of the networks he’d trained.\n\nThe three members of Obvious dove in. LinkedIn profiles indicate that only one has formal training in machine learning. In a message thread on Github last year, that member, Hugo Caselles-Dupré, repeatedly prodded Barrat to update his code and upload new pretrained networks.\n\nOn the day of the auction, Obvious tweeted that it didn’t use one of those pretrained networks to create the work sold at Christie’s. Instead, the members claim, Edmond de Belamy was made by a version of DCGAN they trained themselves, using data gathered with Barrat’s WikiArt scraper.\n\nHowever they did it, their portraits are strikingly similar to those generated by Barrat. The controversy over the Obvious sale prompted New Zealand artist and academic Tom White to try the teenager’s pretrained networks for himself. The images he produced wouldn’t have looked out of place next to Edmond de Belamy on the wall of Christie’s viewing room in New York.\n\nSomething Obvious didn’t do was talk about was where it got the recipe, and some of the code, that produced its artwork. A blog post from the collective in February on its project didn’t mention Barrat at all, according to a version saved by the Internet Archive in April. By September, Barrat had been added.\n\nBarrat's latest algorithms generate somewhat unusual clothes.\n\nRobbie Barrat\n\nMazzone at College of Charleston said borrowing ideas and images in art is no problem—think of Warhol’s soup cans—as long as you don’t try to hide it. “They could have solved this problem very easily by saying here’s what we started with,” she says. In a tweet posted the day before the auction last month, Obvious apologized and told Barrat, \"You deserve a lot of credit, it's true. We cannot control how big it has become.\"\n\nBarrat continues to work on AI art around his day job applying machine learning to biological sciences in a Stanford research lab. He’s currently experimenting with using images from fashion shows to generate glitchy new garments, and he's working with a clothes designer to get the weird creations made for real. He says he expects to keep publishing code and ideas openly, but more cautiously.\n\n“Open source is important to me, because this is how I learned to do this stuff growing up in the middle of nowhere in West Virginia,” Barrat says. “I‘m going to keep doing open source but be more careful about it.”\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n",

          "description": "It’s no secret that what was once a “traditional family” structure has drastically evolved over the past few decades. Now, with all types of family arrangements, children may not always share the same last name as their parents. (See our related story on the documents LGBTQ families should never travel without.)\n\nIn today’s modern world, it’s increasingly common for adults to travel with kids that don’t share the same last name. From an immediate family standpoint, perhaps the children have the same last name as the other parent while you still kept your own (like in my case), or maybe the kids have a last name that is a hybrid of both.\n\nMaybe you’re a grandparent, step-parent, legal guardian or chaperone that’s taking a trip with children that aren’t biologically your own. Of course it’s perfectly legal to travel with kids who don’t share your last name or may not be related to you, but these circumstances do require a bit more preparation beforehand to avoid any headaches with security and customs. This is true even if you are the child’s parent.\n\nAs a mom that travels solo often with my two young kids with different last names than mine, I’m aware that there’s a bit more preparation needed on my end before I hit the skies with my offspring.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Angelina Aucello\n\nID for Kids On Domestic Flights\n\nThe TSA does not require children under 18 to provide identification when traveling with a companion within the United States, but some airlines have their own protocols. For example, Southwest strictly enforces its policy requiring adults to provide a copy of a birth certificate for children under the age of 2 traveling as lap infants — even on domestic flights. You should always contact the airline for information on its policies or questions regarding specific ID requirements for travelers under 18.\n\nOf course, traveling domestically with kids is a lot easier than traveling internationally — where you’ll most likely run into more questioning and extra security screenings. But, having your documents in order will allow you to breeze through the process — no matter where you’re flying. Here are our thoughts on the best domestic airlines for families.\n\nID for Kids On International Flights\n\nTraveling internationally with kids subjects travelers to more ID and consent requirements.\n\nFirst and foremost, passports are required for all passengers traveling internationally, regardless of age or last name. Unlike the case of domestic flights, taking a child on an international flight without presence/permission of the other parent or legal guardian is not permitted.\n\nThis requirement is in place to prevent the unfortunate cases of kidnapping, even in families. There is no “official consent form,” so you’ll have to prepare one on your own. As a guideline, it’s generally a notarized and dated statement from one parent/guardian granting permission to the other parent or traveling adult to travel internationally with the child.\n\nIn the letter, be sure to include a statement of permission to travel along with the names of the children, the intended travel dates/destination, the names of the adult(s) permitted to travel with the children, and the names and contact information of the parent(s) granting permission.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Angelina Aucello\n\nI always keep a generic signed/notarized consent form with me when I travel internationally with the kids, but I’ve rarely been asked to show it. In fact, even if both parents are flying together, it’s not a bad idea for each parent to carry a signed and notarized consent form just in case you somehow get separated. If you’re curious, here are our thoughts on the most family-friendly international carriers.\n\nBe Prepared for Extra Time at the Airport\n\nOn a recent trip to London with my 4-year-old son, the UK immigrations officer quickly noticed that my son’s last name differed from mine and slyly “interviewed” my son in a playful manner: “What’s your name, buddy? Are you traveling with just your mom today?”\n\nThen he turned to me and asked me to verify my son’s middle name and DOB. He was looking to see how quickly I responded, kind of like when a bouncer at a nightclub questions if the ID you forked over really is yours.\n\nMind you that process was rather quick and, of course, the questioning of both the child and parent stems from good intentions to verify the relationship between the two.\n\nThe UK Home Office tweeted about this process not too long ago.\n\nIf your family has different surnames, please bring birth or adoption certificates to help get through passport control quicker. https://t.co/7l1Y7ngeCP #fasteruktravel pic.twitter.com/OwHeR72SXs\n\n— Home Office (@ukhomeoffice) August 1, 2018\n\nBottom Line\n\nSadly, parental kidnapping, abduction and child trafficking are very real threats in the world we live in. So, if you’re traveling internationally with a child — even your own — and you don’t share the same last name, you’ll have to come with extra documentation and be prepared to spend some extra time at the airport in some cases. Though it may seem like a hassle, it serves an important purpose.\n\nEven if you’re just traveling domestically, if you think you may run into issues at security or at the check-in counter, it may be wise to bring along a copy of the child’s birth certificate/adoption papers/legal guardianship documents and a generic consent form just for the extra peace of mind. Having a copy of those documents not only works as an ID that shows proof of age, but it also proves your relationship to the child, especially if your last names differ.\n\nWhat have your experiences been like when traveling with kids who don’t share your last name?\n\nAngelina Aucello covers family travel for TPG and writes the popular blog, Angelina Travels. Follow along with all her travel adventures on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nFeatured image by Ippei Naoi / Getty Images\n",

          "description": "When Kate was pregnant with our first kiddo, I wanted to do the best I could to help her out during her pregnancy, as well as prepare for being a father to Gus when he finally arrived on the scene. So I did what any 21st century dad-to-be would do: I hopped on Amazon to see what books were out there on the subject.\n\nWhat I discovered was that there wasn’t much useful information available for soon-to-be-fathers and new dads.\n\nMost of the books out there for new dads were short on useful information but chock-full of funny illustrations that made being a dad look comically manly, tips that implied that fathers will be natural bumblers, and one-liners about losing access to your wife’s boobs since they’ll be squatted on by a baby blocker. It’s like they thought men were morons, couldn’t imagine that a dude would be sincerely interested in prepping to be a good dad, or felt that a guy who had such an interest might feel so insecure about it that the information he sought needed to be presented in a satirically masculine, punch-you-in-the-arm style.\n\nThis was eight years ago.\n\nToday, it hasn’t gotten any better.\n\nBooks for new dads continue to put an emphasis on eye-rolling and often condescending yuks instead of providing fathers information they can actually put into practice.\n\nBut a few useful books for soon-to-be and new dads do exist. After reviewing a whole lot of them, below I highlight 4 that I think are the best.\n\nNote: If you’re not one to read a whole book on parenting, I think we do a really excellent job of presenting a cliff notes version of all the basics you need to know in the following articles:\n\nA Man’s Guide to Pregnancy\n\nHow to Take Care of a Pregnant Wife\n\nGetting Ready for the Baby Bomb\n\nYour Progeny Enters the World\n\nNew Dad Survival Guide\n\nThe Skillset\n\nThe Mindset\n\nWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting\n\nYes, it’s primarily geared towards moms-to-be, but this classic baby book is jam-packed with useful information about pregnancy that an expectant dad might also want to know. From fetal development to tips on how to handle the first few months of your baby’s life, a lot of the information is useful for both new parents. Throughout the book they also have callouts geared just towards dads (including how you do the sex when your wife is pregnant and how long you’ll need to wait after birth before you can resume relations). I actually found this the most useful book I read as an expectant dad.\n\nI’d add that some women don’t like this book because they feel that reading about so many potential problems/symptoms creates unnecessary stress, but this is actually a good reason for you to read it too. As a dad, you’ll often play the role of the more dispassionate researcher/diagnoser, i.e., your wife will feel concerned that baby has X problem, and you’ll be the one who looks into it, and offers reassurances: “It’s much more likely that it’s actually Y benign issue. We’ll ask the doctor. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nWhat to Expect the First Year\n\nDo you go to the doctor for that cough? What do you do if your baby isn’t sleeping? Is my baby developing normally? These are just a few of the questions that new parents will ask once they bring home their bundle of joy.\n\nA book that both Kate and I found quite useful during the first twelve months of Gus’ life was What to Expect the First Year. Pretty much any concern or question you might have during the first year of your baby’s life will be addressed in this book (and it’s generally best to just consult one standard source like this on such questions rather than trolling through dozens of forums filled with anecdotal stories).\n\nAll meat and no filler. Two thumbs up.\n\nThe Expectant Father: Facts, Tips, and Advice for Dads-to-Be\n\nThis is the probably the best book geared exclusively towards expectant fathers. No lame jokes. Just straight up useful information. The Expectant Father covers the pregnancy process and how dads can help in it, as well as provides tons of useful info for dads on raising a kid.\n\nThey also cover why dads are so important in the development of a child and how children influence fathers. After the What to Expect books, this would be the one “dad-to-be” book I’d recommend.\n\nGreat Expectations: Becoming a Dad: The First Three Years\n\nWritten by social worker and psychotherapist David Carr, Great Expectations is unique in that it not only covers the psychological development your new kiddo will go through during the first three years of his or her life, it gets into the transformation that will happen in your psyche too. Alongside standard practical tips, Carr offers advice on how to handle the adjustment to your new role as a father and the way your life will change once your baby arrives. \n\nThe post 4 Recommended Books for Soon-to-Be and New Dads appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",

          "description": "In the span of a single week this past April, two of my dreams were realized: My third child Pippa was born, and I was nominated to serve on the Federal Trade Commission, one of the five Senate-confirmed appointees who lead the government’s competition and consumer protection agency. I suddenly faced an acute version of a question with which almost all women regularly grapple: how best to balance my professional and personal priorities without sacrificing either.\n\nThis was not my first time contemplating how to balance work and family: My first two children were born when I held a demanding job as counsel in the United States Senate. Luckily, I had a boss who provided 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, which I took. But as an FTC commissioner, it would be different; I would be legally expected to fulfill my responsibilities whether or not I was physically in the office. That meant that while no one could technically prevent me from taking an extended time away for maternity leave, the responsibilities of my office would be left unfilled if I did so. And because I would be the highest-ranking person in my new office, how to handle this would be my choice alone.  \n\nHelp our reporting on pregnancy\n\nAre you pregnant? Have you ever been pregnant? Or do you work with pregnant women? We’re reporting on pregnancy for a series here at Vox and we’d love to hear from you. Please check out this survey for Vox.\n\nI explored what other commissioners had done, but I could find no record of any at my agency over its 100-year history who had given birth during their terms in office. I weighed my options. I could ask for my confirmation to be delayed, an extremely high-risk gamble in unpredictable Washington, or I could find care for Pippa starting at just a few weeks old, which felt like something I wanted to avoid at all costs.  \n\nAfter careful consideration, I decided to try another route: to care for the baby and do the job at once. I would power through the confirmation process and begin the new job, and I would do so with Pippa at my side — or, more accurately, strapped to my chest — until I felt she was ready for day care.  \n\nFor four months, I took a BYOB approach to my new job: bring your own baby. It was the imperfect solution to a confluence of events that made more conventional options even more unworkable for me than they are for most American mothers. Every mother I know has felt squeezed by the challenge of adapting her career to and finding care for a new baby; I am exceptionally lucky that I was able to carve a new path for myself.     \n\n        Rebecca Slaughter, FTC commissioner, with her newborn daughter Pippa, 7 weeks, in her office at work at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, DC, on May 23, 2018. \n\n        Gabriella Demczuk\n\nThe day-to-day of BYOB\n\nTo prepare for my BYOB experiment, I stocked up on supplies to bring to my office and warned prospective staff that if they hated babies, they probably would not want to work for me. I made a plan to come into the office three days a week with Pippa; the other two days, I would work as needed from home. Instead of embarking on the foreign travel and public speaking that my fellow commissioners started immediately, I would spend my first few months focused on internal meetings with agency staff. And I would reevaluate regularly to make sure that both Pippa and I were happy and healthy in this arrangement. I knew my plan was unorthodox, but so was my situation.\n\nMy confirmation hearing went ahead just nine days after Pippa was born — I was running purely on adrenaline and don’t remember much of it, though there is video evidence that it happened, in which you can sneak a peek of Pippa tucked snugly against my supportive husband’s chest. Over the two weeks that followed, I returned to a quasi-maternity leave, with the continual nursing and rocking cycle of infancy interrupted occasionally to draft responses to senators or venturing out for an occasional follow-up meeting.\n\nI was sworn in the day Pippa turned 1 month old, and that day, I began to implement my BYOB plan. I set up a changing table on my window sill, stocked my filing cabinet with diapers, toys, and swaddles, and borrowed a travel crib from a colleague. In the early days, Pippa mostly slept through my meetings. The first time she woke up to eat, I was hosting a meeting about a competition case with mostly male attorneys. I panicked briefly before pulling on my nursing cover and latching her on. The conversation continued without anyone missing a beat, and I never again hesitated to feed her as needed.  \n\nAs Pippa grew, she spent more time awake. Since most of my time at the office was occupied by meetings, her alertness meant she would frequently sit on my lap and babble at my colleagues — she clearly did not like to be excluded from the conversations. I kept a burp cloth at my conference table for the too-frequent moments when she chose to punctuate a point with a little geyser of spit-up. To manage the times when she got fussy, I became expert at bouncing her while I was talking. Occasionally, I had to pause a discussion to change her quickly, but I learned how to slap on a new diaper in record speed.    \n\n        On the left, Pippa with Commissioner Noah Phillips. In the middle and right, Pippa stays in Commissioner Slaughter’s office.\n\n        Courtesy of Rebecca Slaughter\n\nI was nervous about how my new colleagues would react to Pippa’s presence. I wanted to make a good impression at my new job, and I knew from experience that I was not likely to be my best and most professional self when I was newly postpartum and potentially covered in spit-up. But the reaction I got from colleagues was overwhelmingly positive and supportive; they seemed genuinely fond of Pippa, and it turns out even heated discussions can be more pleasant with a cooing newborn to bring some perspective. I also heard from many staffers that they appreciated having a commissioner send the unambiguous message that parenthood is as much a priority as the job.\n\nBringing my baby to the office worked for me, but it was not easy. I was achingly tired. I had to take copious notes to make sure I could retain the things I was learning. And I often felt guilty about neither parenting nor working as well as I knew I would if I were focused on one task at a time. When the guilt or exhaustion threatened to get the better of me, I considered whether I wanted to make a change, and the answer was consistently no.\n\nMy imperfect strategy was better than either alternative; I was not comfortable leaving Pippa in someone else’s care yet, and I would not have been happy sitting on the sidelines as a new commission got up and running. So I kept our unconventional arrangement until, when Pippa was exactly 5 months old, a spot opened up for her in day care. She was bigger, stronger, and more active; we were both ready for her to start. The BYOB experiment was over.\n\nMy story highlights how hard it is to be a working mom in America\n\nI share my story not to suggest that my experience with Pippa either could or should be replicated universally; it was a compromise that would not even have been right for me with my previous pregnancies. Bringing Pippa to work was only possible because of several unusual circumstances. She was my third baby, and the delivery was not medically complicated for either Pippa or me. I have a deep bench of support, starting with my husband, who picked up slack wherever needed. And I have the seniority at my job to make decisions without asking anyone’s permission.  \n\nRather than providing a template for women to replicate, my story illustrates many of the challenges faced by American mothers, most of whom either cannot make the choice I could or would not want to do so. America stands out among industrialized nations for its lack of support for working parents. Among the things I would change, if I were given a magic wand, would be to provide universal paid parental leave. Europe gives a year; that seems reasonable. That leave should apply to mothers and fathers, because only when men take professional pauses to care for their families will women doing so not create a career crater.  \n\nChild care is obscenely expensive, making working cost-prohibitive for many women; there should be more affordable early child care available. And finally, working should not be an all-or-nothing proposition. As important as parental leave is, it is also critical that workplaces have plans in place to reintegrate new parents into the workforce and accommodate the scheduling challenges of young children.\n\nSimply put, women need and deserve meaningful choice. We should be able to choose whether to take a long leave, or go back to work, or even to come up with unconventional arrangements as appropriate. I hope, by sharing the benefits of the flexibility my privilege has allowed me, I can create space for more women to make the choices that work for them.\n\n        Rebecca Slaughter, FTC commissioner, with her newborn daughter Pippa, 7 weeks, in her office at work at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, DC, on May 23, 2018. \n\n        Gabriella Demczuk\n\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter was sworn in as an FTC commissioner on May 2, 2018. Prior to joining the commission, she served as chief counsel to Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. She lives just outside Washington, DC, with her husband, their 6-year-old son, 4-year-old daughter, two dogs, and, of course, baby Pippa.\n\nFirst Person is Vox’s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

          "description": "When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007, Richard Koci Hernandez stood in the audience, covering the historic event as a photojournalist for the San Jose Mercury News. Hernandez raised his camera, a Canon EOD 30D, and snapped a photo of the device that would change his career. Since then, Hernandez’s photos have been featured in print and online for the New York Times, Time, and right here at WIRED—many of them captured with a smartphone. “I've had images taken with my mobile phone printed in coffee table National Geographic books, and you can't tell the difference,\" he says.\n\nToday, Hernandez shoots with a Google Pixel, the iPhone XS, and the 2016 iPhone SE, which he likes for its smaller size. The simplicity of mobile phones, he says, lets people focus on the most important in a photo: the moment, the subject, and the story.\n\nMany other pro photographers have similarly turned to smartphones to get their shots. We spoke with some of them to get their tips, advice, and app recommendations for taking and editing fantastic photos with your 12 megapixel shooters. The bottom line? Pick the editing tools that fit your needs, and take advantage of spontaneity, and don't sweat it if your phone is a few years old. The ability to take photos anytime, anywhere, is the greatest advantage—even on last year's phone.\n\nDon’t Knock the Native Functions\n\nYou can achieve a lot with what’s already on your phone. Before you even take the photo, tap on the screen to designate your desired subject in the frame. This helps to adjust the exposure and focus around that subject. \"What happens is you ultimately get more properly exposed images,\" Hernandez says, \"which means that your blacks look better, your whites look better, all your tones look better.\"\n\nBefore you start downloading third-party apps, start in your native camera app. Native editing functions have only gotten more comprehensive and sophisticated over the years, especially on more recent iPhones and Androids. Play around with basic brightness and contrast controls to dramatically change your shot.\n\nHernandez also advises turning the flash off by default, since a phone's native flash settings can be harsh and unflattering. Instead, try to time and position your shots so that you can make the most of natural light. \"It has a more organic, authentic feel,\" he says, \"and I think that offers a little bit of emotion to it.\" Flash can be useful in really dark settings, but for the most part, more sophisticated phones have been getting better at taking low-light shots, so there's less of a need to keep it on.\n\nEdit With Pro Apps\n\nWhen you want to achieve an effect that requires more nuance than the native editing functions can provide, turn to these pro-recommended editing apps.\n\nSnapseed (free on iOS and Android) provides an extensive set of editing tools with a simple, usable interface. When Brooklyn-based photographer Andrew Kung edits on his iPhone 7, he starts out by making granular edits on Snapseed, like fine-tuning saturation, contrast, or adding portrait-specific enhancements. \"It's just so thorough,\" Kung says. While less extensive than desktop web editing tools, Kung says it has almost all of the inputs he'd look at when he's editing in Lightroom and Photoshop, all packaged in an intuitive interface.\n\nAdobe Lightroom CC (free on iOS and Android) offers another comprehensive suite of tools. It’s a favorite of Los Angeles-based photographer Michelle Groskopf, whose photos have appeared in WIRED. She's used Lightroom CC to cover broad needs, like playing with exposure, and fix specific issues, like pulling a subject’s face out of a backlit photo.\n\nVSCO (free on iOS and Android) is a little more limited in its editing tools, but streamlined and simple to use for beginning photographers. With perfectly satisfying set of editing options, and a suite of beautiful filters, VSCO’s better suited for faster, more cursory edits.\n\nFinally, for those who want to grace their smartphone photos some analog charm, our photographers recommend Hipstamatic and NOMO - Point and Shoot. When you shoot photos on Hipstamatic ($2.99, iOS only), you can set analog controls, like setting the manual shutter speed, and provides some post-processing editing tools. NOMO (free, iOS and Android) translates the feel of a 35mm onto a smartphone: Take the photo in the app, and shake your phone to “develop” it as you would on a Polaroid.\n\nOne Last Shot\n\nYou don't need fancy hardware to get a good shot. Kung’s photography career began as a college student, casually snapping photos of his native San Francisco on an early iPhone. “It’s a different path than a lot of ‘serious’ photographers take,” he says, but it illustrates smartphone cameras’ greatest advantage: simplicity and accessibility. Our steadfast pocket cameras allows us to take lots of pictures, anywhere, without the investment of film or costly accessories.\n\nFor Kung, becoming a better smartphone photographer is all about \"taking a bunch of photos and understanding what attracts you to those photos.\" He encourages photographers to examine an image and try to understand what, specifically, makes photos beautiful to them, whether that's the image's light, shadow, contrast, subject, or symmetry—all qualities that, as Hernandez points out, the smartphone's simplicity allows you to focus on better.\n\nHernandez suggests photographers to take advantage of what he calls the \"invisibility cloak\" that smartphone cameras afford photographers. While a “serious” camera draws attention to itself, an ubiquitous smartphone blends into a scene seamlessly. Mobile photographers can take advantage of the kinds of photos that phones are in a unique position to take: the scenes where subjects are less aware of the camera, less posed, and more interesting.\n\nAt the end of the day, Michelle Groskopf says that good photography is more about the scene and less about the tool. “The best camera is the one you have on you,” she says. Given our ever-smarter smartphone cameras, the shooter in your pocket makes for a fine tool indeed.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n",

Known for his time designing iconic products for Braun and later Vitsœ, Rams' 10 Principles of Design have garnered him a top spot on the list of most influential industrial designers of our time. We won't give too much of Rams' design story away, as director Gary Hustwit did the work for us with his new feature-length documentary, RAMS, which is all about the life and philosophies of the eponymous designer. \n\n Rams - Official Trailer from Film First on Vimeo.\n\nRAMS hasn't released yet, but I had the exciting chance to attend the New York screening at SVA's theater last month. I was expecting the film to serve as a timeline for Rams-designed products, but the crowd ended up being treated to so much more. Instead of solely focusing on Rams' work, Hustwit chose to tell a more compelling story—that of a designer who spent his entire career bringing beloved consumer products to life but deeply regrets (and continues to contemplate) the role his products played in creating a wasteful, disposable society. \n\nHustwit structured the documentary around Rams' backstory, both personal and professional. The film comprised of dialogue from Rams and his colleagues sandwiched between moments left with nothing but the powerful sounds of Brian Eno's original soundtrack and striking visuals of products and architecture. Naturally, I left hungry for more information, but there was no denying that Hustwit's stripped-down editing style appropriately played homage to Rams' 10 Principles of Design and the designer's personality.\n\nTo give a glimpse into the making of RAMS, I've combined tidbits from the Q&A session held after the NYC screening with Hustwit and Mark Adams, Managing director of Vitsœ, with a separate follow-up interview with Hustwit:\n\nWhen you started working on RAMS, did you realize the film would turn into something larger than design—a whole commentary on consumerism?\n\nGary Hustwit: Yeah, the contradiction of Dieter regretting being a designer and feeling like he played a part in getting us to the consumerist point we're at is exactly why I wanted to do this. He said something early on in the film about how we are going through another period of technological and social change due to a completely different global/cultural situation. Working on this film has been three and a half years of meeting with Dieter, talking with him and trying to understand how things have changed. The world has changed in a lot of ways over that time, and I think that is reflected in the kind of conversations I was having with Dieter and with the other people in the film. \n\nA lot of what Dieter has done over the past 20 years since he's been out of design has really crystallized his thinking around sustainability issues and his whole less but better philosophy. That is what pushed me over the edge to do the film. If it would have just been, \"Wow Dieter is amazing, look at all this amazing design he did\"... That's fine too, but that was only part of what interested me in his story. \n\nIn some ways, I wish I didn't have to talk about his designs. I realize that they're obviously the reason he's well-known, but I was much more interested in encapsulating his philosophy in the film than I was talking about the radius of a curve on a radio. Dieter spent so much time thinking about how we relate to consumer electronics and decided to not be involved in creating digital products. He has this really objective view on the behavioral changes that smartphones and additional technology have brought around. He has this incredible point of view that's informed by a 60-year career of designing and making products.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to persuade Dieter and Ingeborg to open up one last time. They felt that everything they've said is already in the public domain. They have nothing more to say, and yet this seemed to be a glaring omission. I think it's fantastic that we've got this.\" —Mark Adams\n\nMark Adams: I'm a great believer in the pendulum. It swings, and it can over-swing. I think Dieter would certainly have the argument that the digital pendulum is over-swinging at the moment. We just need to come back somewhat. Dieter often talks about what limited resources he had growing up and what limited education he had because his education was frankly completely interrupted by the war. He took a great deal of inspiration from that. He would go back to, \"Where did the modern movement come from?\" Well, the modern movement came from the destruction of WWII. Therefore, it was all about cleanliness and light—it wasn't about cool white spaces that were going to have a particular aesthetic. It was all about health. It was all about sweeping away the destruction that had become before.\n\nRams' 10 Principles of Design were, rightfully so, a major theme in RAMS. Did you consider the Principles while filming and editing the documentary? Which principle out of Rams' 10 Principles of Design do you think shines through most in the film (deliberately or non-deliberately)?\n\nGH: We had the 10 principles taped up on the wall next to the editing computer, and number 10 ended up shining through the most. I kept thinking about number 10 in terms of how to structure the film and even just with incorporating simplicity as much as possible into the making of the film. It'd be impossible to make a cluttered, messy film about Dieter Rams. I kept thinking about that as well as the overall length of the film. It was longer before, but I kept going through it and reducing, reducing, reducing. That's the editing process for a documentary anyway, but for this one, it felt especially critical. With every scene we had to ask ourselves, do we need this extra line? Well, no, the point's been made. Okay great. We went down the list and tried to make it as streamlined as possible.\n\nGiven that Dieter and his wife Ingeborg are extremely private people, what particular factors did you have to take into consideration when deciding how to approach, and eventually, document them on film?\n\nGH: They really are very private people. I think there's a generational difference, and it might even be a German thing. This idea of sharing details about your private life and talking about your personal relationship with someone else is not something that they do. I would've loved to interview Ingeborg. We spent a ton of time with her, but she didn't want to talk on camera, and I respected that. But, they kind of chastised me a little bit about it (laughs). They were like, \"We're not like you Americans—always wanting to talk about everything that you feel.\"\n\nDieter is really fastidious about his house, which is one of the reasons why he doesn't like the media and doesn't let people come into his house anymore to do any kind of filming or photography. He's tired of having people disrupt his living space. We look at that house and we think it's like a museum or something—it's amazing. But it's really their private home that they've lived in for 50 years, and you have to respect that. Everything from taking our shoes off when we're inside and being really careful about everything to just showing overall respect for their environment was really important. For all of the filming we did in his home, we didn't use lighting. Luckily, there's a ton of natural light in that house, and it looks beautiful. \n\n\"Everybody wants things quickly now, but it's refreshing to take your time sometimes. This film took me three and a half years. Could I have made it in one year? Probably, but it wouldn't have been the same.\" —Gary Hustwit\n\nWe were trying to do as little filmmaking as possible—just the bare minimum of our equipment and our crew. It was really, really stripped down, and I think he appreciated that when we came into his space. It's definitely the reason he came back to work with us again. Every time I saw him after that first time, he would bring it up. \"Oh, you guys were so amazing, you had no equipment.\" He appreciated that we were low impact basically—as little design as possible. \n\nEverybody wants things quickly now, but it's refreshing to take your time sometimes. This film took me three and a half years. Could I have made it in one year? Probably, but it wouldn't have been the same. I wouldn't have documented all the things I got to document like building the Vitsœ headquarters. Even working with Brian Eno wouldn't have happened if I had finished the film earlier. There are benefits to slowing down the process, especially with a long-form documentary.\n\nWhat was the process of working with Brian Eno like, and how did you connect with him?\n\nGH: I had a sense that somehow Rams and Eno would work together. There's some sort of shared aesthetic there, and I had a feeling that maybe Eno was a fan of Rams. I called Eno's manager and sure enough, he was a fan, and it went from there. Brian just wants to be in the studio creating. Anything else is extraneous. I would show him a ton of footage, and then he would use it as inspiration to write and then he'd send us tracks. I'm a huge fan of his work, so it was incredible to work with him. I think there is something there—a lot of times I can't put my finger on it, but I know there was some crossover or some sort of a symbiosis.\n\nWhy did you decide to start using Kickstarter to help fund your films, including RAMS?\n\nGH: I originally got into film through music. I'd helped some friends produce a couple music documentaries, and in those cases, the fans of the band wanted to see the result even more than we did. Engaging the audience and involving them in the process of making the documentaries was already something that we were doing. I always think along the lines of, \"How am I going to go into a boardroom of investors and convince them to make a film about a font?\" It would never have happened. But there are other people like you who want to see these projects made too, so why can't we get together and make this thing happen? Kickstarter formalized this idea.\n\nWhat were some of the main challenges you and your team faced while creating RAMS?\n\nGH: Subtitles change the way you pace the film. There's that looking and reading, looking and reading, looking and reading; it gets hard. When I first came up with the idea for the film four years ago, I wanted it just to be in Dieter's voice, and it was going to be simple. Objectified and Urbanized both had other languages besides English, but it was very specific for scenes—only two or three minutes at a time—so it wasn't like this where the majority of the dialogue is German. But you have to do these things in a person's original language. It would have been silly to have Dieter push through and try to do it all in English. I ended up having a great group of design experts, finders, curators, and others who would be right next to me, having the conversations with topics already in mind. Then we'd take breaks and discuss them afterward.\n\n\"The 10 principles worked for Rams, but people can and should make their own principles. Create a written set of ideals and then, when you see something that you think is bad, you have a framework to justify why it is bad.\" —Gary Hustwit\n\nThe 99% of things you have to leave out is also tough. Dieter has had an incredibly long career. I was more interested in his ideas and philosophies, especially about culture now, than I was about his classic Braun designs. Trying to balance all of these themes out was a huge challenge. It really was about the 10 principles. I was trying to keep things as pure as possible, but there's so much to talk about. I think we definitely go into the specifics of his designs and design philosophy. I'm not sure it would have come out if we didn't—maybe the zen diaries of Dieter Rams or something. It took me ten years to get enough trust to film him in the backyard with a bonsai tree. Maybe in another ten years, we'll finish shooting something else.\n\nAre there any other designers that you can see yourself making a feature-length film about in the future?\n\nGH: Every designer or architect in any of my films deserves a full-length documentary. I can't exactly say why Dieter was the one that I decided to do. Part of it was that I felt that if I didn't push and try to do it, then it would never happen. I kept thinking about how if I didn't do it, there won't be a Dieter Rams film or there'll be some crappy one that comes out after he's dead. I mean, I personally really wanted to watch it, and that's what motivates me. There are so many incredible designers who all deserve having films about them, and I'm assuming you guys want to watch more design documentaries about designers, so I'll try to keep making them.\n\nThe architecture in the film was particularly striking. Who is the architect of Rams' house?\n\nMA: It's unattributed who actually designed the whole estate. It's one of those don't believe everything you read on the internet things. Dieter does not live in a house that he designed. He designed the interior, but he did not design the dimensions of it.\n\nOn a similar note, the Vitsœ headquarters was a major setting in the film due to Rams' involvement during the design process. Who is the actual architect of the building?\n\nMA: No architects for the Vitsœ building. We started with academics about eight years ago, sitting down at Cambridge University and Imperial College and contemplating, \"How might we go about this?\". We had about 30 really good brains who contributed to it. Only when we got to the point where we completely designed it, we then had to deliver it. We were then told that you legally have to have architects involved. So at that point, we brought in a firm of delivery architects who were specialists in timber architecture.\n\nDia:Beacon was one of the main inspirations for the building. I measured out every aspect of Dia:Beacon one cold Sunday in February. Being in that space and talking to the gallery assistants was the final confirmation for me. They have very artistically educated gallery assistants who just oozed the joy of being in a naturally lit space. That's what we'd been wanting to do. We came away from that day and just said, \"Absolutely this is what we have to do.\"\n\nVitsœ is a rare kind of furniture company that doesn't relentlessly come up with new products, which is very much in line with Rams' philosophy. In a culture where you typically need to make more product to make more money, how can this type of business be sustainable?\n\nMA: I get this question asked often: How can you have a viable business from persuading as many customers as possible to buy as little as possible from you that they're going to use preferably for generations? We actually see people put our furniture in their wills and hand it on. The way we do it? There are 7.2 billion people on this planet, and the vast majority of them have not heard of Vitsœ. That is our opportunity—every single person that we can take from operating a certain way to coming over to our side. We see that word \"fulfillment\" come across them. There are those few objects experiences that you have in your life that genuinely give you fulfillment rather than short term satisfaction. That is the trick. Once we get people into our world, they very rarely leave it. Then we see them literally physically drag other people into our spaces and say, \"Here you are, Vitsœ.\" They all bloody well sought us out. So that is the only way in which the model works. It's that tremendous power of word of mouth.\n\nAs Neils Vitsœ was coming towards the end of his life, there was very much the chip on his shoulder that he knew he had always been 30, 40 years ahead of the curve, and yet commercially that is a very very difficult place to be. Dieter often talks about the late '50s, early '60s at Braun, and how there were senior resignations from the company at that point because what they were doing was way too far ahead of the market. There were people inside the company who were saying, \"This is insanity, this is not going to work.\" There's no doubt in my mind that the Vitsœ journey is a difficult one. If anyone wants to go and setup a business to make money, do not do it like Vitsoe. I would, however, argue that we need many more businesses like Vitsœ on our single planet with its single planet's worth of resources when 7.2 billion of us are here and we need three planets.\n\nYou get a sense of humility from watching the documentary, but in person, do you get the feeling that Dieter recognizes his impact on design and the world at large?\n\nGH: I don't think he regrets the work that he did—I think he's really proud of it—but, I think he sees the connections from the 1960s post-war mass production to where we're at now. I think feeling complicit in that development is his regret, along with the sustainability part of this; being someone who is working at a company that was churning out a lot of mass-produced plastic goods. I think the difference is that they designed them to last. You can buy a Braun juicer from the 70s or a coffee maker or any of these products or an alarm clock, they still work just as well as they did back then. It's just a different philosophy. I think as you see that change, he's really annoyed by it, as you can tell from the film.\n\n\"Dieter is not interested in any more products—he's interested in transmitting his 65 years of experience to the next generations.\" —Mark Adams\n\nA student came up to me after watching the film and said, \"Wow, the 10 Principles are such a great idea. We need to be able to talk more about what's good and bad design like Dieter does, but I don't really know how to do that.\" That was really what the ten principles were about. They weren't meant to be this overreaching design philosophy or for Rams to push out to the masses; they were created for his team to have some rules because, at the time, they didn't have any guidelines during their design process. The 10 principles worked for Rams, but people can and should make their own principles. Go home and write down the things that are important to you—the things you want to do or don't want to do with your work. Create a written set of ideals and then, when you see something that you think is bad, you have a framework to justify why it is bad.\n\nMA: Can I take you back to the birth of this film? I didn't know it was the birth of it and nor did Gary at the time, but it was about seven years ago in the back of one of Dieter's favorite designs—the black London Taxi. He and I had been in traffic for a while, and we were talking about the state of the world around us as we often do. I was trying to be reassuring to him, and he looked at me earnestly with his steely eyes (because you can look across at each other in a London taxi), and he said, \"Mark, but is anyone even listening?\"\n\nHis fear is that when he dies, his 65 years of professional experience and everything that he has learned will be gone. If we have one unique characteristic as human beings that sets us apart from animals, it's the ability to transmit our knowledge—to learn and to teach. When Gary suggested maybe four years ago that this documentary could be a possibility, that was the argument that I took to Dieter. Maybe this is your opportunity for more people to listen. Now I'm out here promoting this film so I can take back the reassurance to Dieter that there are people listening. That people really do want to hear what he has to say, what he has learned. Dieter is not interested in any more products—he's interested in transmitting his 65 years of experience to the next generations.\n\n*****\n\nLearn more about RAMS here.\n",

          "description": "The forgotten Americans that helped elect Donald Trump are now getting a lot of attention from economists and policy analysts that once overlooked the region.\n\nThis week, the Walton Family Foundation, along with the Brookings Institution, contributed to the growing field of research with The State of the Heartland Factbook, which collects more than 20 socioeconomic indicators across 19 states in the middle of the country. It’s an attempt to move beyond the “the proliferation of red vs. blue maps and apocalyptic talkshow punditry” that its authors say have made it harder to understand the region.\n\n“Let’s look at the facts and not allow perception to rule the day,” said Ross DeVol, a Walton Foundation fellow who contributed to the report. And the data show that many parts of the heartland are doing just fine.\n\nIncome equality\n\nAs defined by the authors, the heartland includes Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South and North Dakota, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. Many of the indicators included in the factbook show that in some areas, the region hasn’t fared any worse than the rest of the country. In others, like wage growth, it has done better.\n\nThe differences between the coasts and the middle aren’t as stark as public perception suggests. Adjusted for purchasing power, average wages in the heartland were $48,000 in 2016, just $1,000 lower than in the rest of the country.\n\nWhile the region remains significantly more rural than the rest of the country, its large metros—places like Nashville, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Oklahoma City—are adding people at a faster pace than in the rest of the country.\n\nWinning exporters\n\nWhile Trump has focused on the manufacturers that left, many remain in the heartland. More than 12% of the area’s GDP is based on exports, higher than the 9.6% in the rest of the country.\n\nThe heartland is particularly strong in the high-tech manufacturing that produces good-paying jobs. The sector makes up nearly 10% of the economy compared to a little above 6% in the rest of the country, and it’s been growing much faster too.\n\nThe region’s farmers, which produce 55% of all crops in the country, are also strong exporters, though the president’s tariff-driven trade policy is making their line of business iffier.\n\nMore education, fewer tariffs\n\nThe state of the heartland starts looking less bright when it comes to education and innovation. Research and development spending as a share of GDP is 2% vs. 2.9% elsewhere. It has only 25 of the top-100 research universities—which can develop commercial applications for technology—though it makes up 30% of the country’s population. The research universities it does have are not evenly spread; six heartland states don’t have any.\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the heartland has been getting a dwindling share of the available venture capital in the US, with most of it being poured along the coasts.\n\nBut perhaps more worryingly, the region’s residents are far behind their counterparts elsewhere in more basic ways. Nearly 7% of them don’t have access to broadband, almost double than the rest of the country. They also lag in education: the share of adults with a bachelor’s degree is 28% vs. nearly 33%. The gap gets a lot wider depending on the state—in Mississippi and Arkansas, university graduates make up closer to 22% of the adult population—or by race and ethnicity.\n\nHeartland Summit\n\nThe study’s authors, along with some 350 entrepreneurs, investors, academics, and business executives will be discussing what kinds of policies need to be put in place to address those challenges at the Heartland Summit, a three-day event in Bentonville, Arkansas. (Its motto: “Meet in the Middle.”) From the get-go, it’s pretty clear that trade tariffs won’t cut it.\n\n“More people are recognizing that if you don’t widely share economic growth geographically it can pull countries and places apart,” said DeVol.\n",

          "description": "Imagine that you’re living in some dystopian future, and you have been accused of being an advanced AI, which is outlawed in this society. The penalty is death, and in order to convince the judge who will decide your fate, you can utter just one word, any word you like from the dictionary, to prove that you’re flesh and blood. What word do you choose? \n\nIt sounds like the setup for a cheesy sci-fi short, but this is actually part of a curious paper from a pair of researchers at MIT on something they call the “Minimal Turing Test.” \n\nInstead of a machine trying to convince someone they’re human through conversation — which was the premise of the original Turing Test, outlined by British scientist Alan Turing in his seminal 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” — the Minimal Turing Test asks for just one word, either chosen completely freely or picked from a pair of words. \n\nThe researchers responsible, John McCoy and Tomer Ullman, clarify that the Minimal Turing Test isn’t a benchmark for AI progress, but a way of probing how humans see themselves in relation to machines. This question is going to become increasingly relevant in a world filled with AI assistants, deepfaked humans, and Google auto reply handling your email. In a world of human-like AI, what do we think sets us apart? What makes us different?\n\nIn the first of McCoy and Ullman’s two tests, 936 participants were asked to select any word they liked that they thought could be proof of their humanity. Despite the free range of choices, results clustered around a small number of themes. The four most frequently picked words were “love” (134 answers), “compassion” (33 answers), “human” (30 answers), and “please” (25 answers), which made up a quarter of all responses. Other clusters were empathy (words like “emotion,” “feelings,” and “sympathy”), and faith and forgiveness (words like “mercy,” “hope,” and “god”). \n\nAll in all, the 936 answers covered 428 individual words, which is a striking amount of cohesion.\n\n        Answers from the one-word test show the most popular single answer was “love.” \n\n        Image by McCoy and Ullman / MIT\n\nIn the second test, 2,405 participants had to choose between pairs of words, deciding which of the two they thought was given by a human and a machine. Again, words like “love,” “human,” and “please” scored strongly, but the winning word was simpler and distinctly biological: “poop.” Yes, out of all of the word pairings, “poop” was selected most frequently to denote the very essence and soul of humanity. Poop.\n\nSpeaking to The Verge, McCoy of MIT’s Sloan Neuroeconomics Laboratory, stressed that the test was more about social psychology than computer science. \n\n“We don’t see it being used as the next CAPTCHA,” McCoy says. “The practical applications it has in the AI computer space is more when you’re thinking about user interface design and things like that. In those contexts, it’s perhaps useful to know how people think about computers and what they think sets them apart.” \n\nThe Turing Test isn’t a good benchmark of AI intelligence by itself\n\nThis makes sense, as even the original Turing Test has long fallen out of favor with computer scientists as a test of machine intelligence. Critics say that it tests the ability of programmers to find conversational hacks that can trick humans more than intelligence. \n\nFor example, in 2014, news coverage pronounced that the Turing Test had been passed by a chatbot. The programmers tricked judges by having their bot identify itself as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy named Eugene Goostman. This provided the perfect cover for the bot’s many mistakes and its inability to answer certain questions. As critics like computer scientist Gary Marcus noted, “What Goostman’s victory really reveals ... is not the advent of SkyNet or cyborg culture but rather the ease with which we can fool others.”\n\nBut this isn’t to say that the Turing Test is useless. Creating computer programs that can chat convincingly is a fruitful challenge for AI researchers that may benefit humanity. The test is also still a fantastic thought experiment that can help us explore complex questions surrounding our understanding of intelligence. We can also modify it to sharpen its focus by asking computers not to simply chat, but to answer queries that require a nuanced and rich understanding of the world. (One example is asking a computer, “What are the plurals of ‘platch’ and ‘snorp’?” A human would probably answer “platches” and “snorps,” despite the fact that these words are nonsense and can’t be found in a dictionary.)\n\nIt’s in this framework that the Minimal Turing Test is best appreciated as a thought experiment, not a benchmark for AI progress. McCoy says what surprised him most about the research was just how much creativity there was in the answers. “People came up with all sorts of interesting shibboleths and puns,” he says, with words like “bootylicious” “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” (Try spelling that without Google.) \n\n“It tells you something about the gap between humans and smart robots,” says McCoy, “that people who have never had to think about this situation before came up with a lot smart and funny results.” It’s something, in other words, that a computer would struggle with. \n",

          "description": "Yesterday (Sept. 27), US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the professor of clinical psychology who accuses him of sexual assault, delivered nearly nine hours of emotional testimony. There were tears; there was rage; there were explanations of neuroscience and eulogies to beer.\n\nThroughout it all, America was watching. According to Nielsen ratings, nearly 20% of US households with televisions were watching the hearings at any given time between 10am and 6:45pm. That’s without factoring in the many more who watched it in public places, on their phones, via digital livestreams, or who caught up on the highlights online after work.\n\nFor CNN, it was the channel’s biggest live video day since the Trump inauguration. For CBS News, it was its most-viewed livestream of the year. And at Fox, where opinion hosts have openly championed Kavanaugh’s nomination, viewers averaged 7.2 million during his appearance and 4.7 million during Ford’s.\n\nYesterday’s hearings meant many different things to many different people—a referendum on #MeToo, a masterclass in the evils of “bro culture” (paywall), a worrying outcome for American men and boys. But one thing remained consistent across party lines: The Kavanaugh hearings were very, very important—even if the “why” has proven more contentious.\n",

          "description": "Unless you are devoid of tastebuds and a heart, you probably love a bread basket. A good complimentary bread, served before the meal, does more than whet your appetite; it breeds loyalty. Case in point: I will go to Red Lobster. Those cheesy, salty, aggressively seasoned Cheddar Bay Biscuits are worth the trip to the seafood chain, but you can actually make them at home, and you can make them better.\n\nJust as there are ‘process’ killers and ‘product’ killers, I like to think that there are process…\n\nRead more Read\n\nIf you need ‘em quick and dirty, there is a Red Lobster branded mix. I have nothing against a mix, but I was curious if the convenient, just-add-water route was the way to go. Would the mix produce a biscuit worthy of the Red Lobster name? Or was there an even better, homemade biscuit recipe to be found on the internet?\n\nAs we found with our brownie taste test, homemade is not always better, but I figured these cheddar drop biscuits from Queen Martha were a good place to start, comparison-wise. First, I made the mix. It was simply a matter of adding water and cheese, mixing until a shaggy dough just formed, and dolloping out 1/4-cup portions onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I baked them until they were golden brown, then brushed them with a mixture of butter and whatever was in that mysterious seasoning packet.\n\nThey certainly looked the part and, when fresh out of the oven, they tasted pretty much exactly like the biscuits you would get in a Red Lobster franchise. The box stresses that one should consume them immediately, and after they cooled, I understood why. Once the biscuit turns room temperature, the flavors become muted, the texture gets rather cake-y, and—if you eat more that one—a headache sets in. (At least that’s what happened to me.) If you needed a quick trip to Cheddar Bay, and were confident in your ability to quickly eat several biscuits before they cooled, this box mix is not a bad choice.\n\nBut for just a little more time and effort, you can have a much better, butterier, more cheese-forward biscuit. I did not need 16 biscuits, so I halved Ms. Stewart’s recipe. If you also wish to make eight cheesy, buttery, clouds of joy, you will need:\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1/2 teaspoon white sugar\n\nPinch of cayenne pepper (I did not halve her original measurement, which was a pinch.)\n\n3 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces\n\n3 ounces shredded sharp cheddar\n\n1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons buttermilk\n\n1 1/2 tablespoons chopped chives\n\nWhisk all of the dry ingredients together, then work the butter in to the mixture with a pastry cutter or your hands, until the butter is fully incorporated and “pea-sized lumps remain.” Add the cheese, buttermilk, and chives, and stir until everything is just combined. Dollop out 1/4-cup-sized portions onto a parchment lined baking sheet, and bake for 15 minutes at 425℉, until the biscuits are golden brown.\n\nThey’re just cheesier!Photo:  Claire Lower\n\nThough Martha did not say to do so, I brushed these babies with a mixture of 2 tablespoons melted butter, one teaspoon of garlic powder, and one tablespoon of chives. This was a good call on my part. These were, in a word, transcendent when they first came out of the oven. They didn’t quite achieve the height of the box-mix biscuits, but I was too focused on the flavor to care that much. Though the boxed-mix biscuits were borderline uncanny in their likeness to those found in Cheddar Bay, their beauty faded in mere minutes, and they just didn’t taste as gloriously cheesy and buttery as Martha’s. (As a self-identified Cheddar Goblin, cheesiness is important.)\n\n The cheddar in these carby wonders had poked out here and there, forming wonderful little Frito-like bits around the biscuit. That, coupled with the flavor of real chives and tangy buttermilk made these some of the best drop biscuits I’ve ever had. (They were also still tasty the next morning, which is another thing that is important to me.)\n",

          "description": "Ah, fall! It’s the time of year when a horde of fashion editors, store buyers, and social media influencers travel to New York, London, Milan, and Paris for each city’s fashion week. This time around, pockets are big on the runways. Literally, they are very big.\n\nOn the runway at Fendi, models wore leather coats that bulged with pockets of all sizes, which looked like they could easily fit a phone, an iPad, and a few packs of Rolos, or tampons. At Alberta Ferretti, there were outsize cargo pockets ballooning off of miniskirts and vertically stacked on denim jackets.\n\nDesigners have played with the proportion of pockets before; Ferretti’s cargo skirts, for example, resemble ones that Marc Jacobs showed in September 2014. But it’s a micro-trend that’s worth paying attention to, because pockets are the site of a centuries-old gender divide in fashion — one that has deep political implications. \n\n        A model walks the Alberta Ferretti runway at Milan Fashion Week.\n\n        Victor Virgile/Getty Images\n\n        A model walks the Alberta Ferretti runway at Milan Fashion Week.\n\n        Victor Virgile/Getty Images\n\nDespite most women’s insistence that they do want pockets, a lot of clothing is entirely lacking this feature. And sometimes clothes do have pockets, but they’re tiny and therefore useless, save for storing a few individual sticks of gum. \n\nexec: So what do we think women want in fashion?women: Pocke--exec: Cold shoulder tops in pastels. Got it.women: Pock--exec: Clothes with pre-made holes in delicate fabrics.women: Po--exec: Cut-outs in flabby areas. Good.women: POCKET--exec: Shapes that require new bras!\n— Delilah S. Dawson (@DelilahSDawson) June 20, 2018\n\nThis is something women have railed against for a long time. As Chelsea G. Summers reported for Racked, the Rational Dress Society, which was founded in 1891 with the aim to ditch corsets and get women into more movement-friendly clothing, was all about pockets. Suffragette suits had pockets in spades.\n\nWomen and men used to wear pockets equally, Summers writes: Everyone wore belts with satchels hanging from them in medieval times. But in the late 17th century, sewn pockets migrated into men’s trousers and coats, while women kept wearing external pouches concealed under a slit in their skirts. When in the late 18th century full gowns gave way to slimmer empire waist dresses — popularized in the west by Joséphine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoleon — those pouches had nowhere to go. So women started carrying small purses called reticules.\n\nThis, writes Summers, had the effect of limiting women’s freedom. “Take away pockets happily hidden under garments, and you limit women’s ability to navigate public spaces, to carry seditious (or merely amorous) writing, or to travel unaccompanied,” she writes.\n\nThus, when women started wearing visible pockets in the early 20th century, women reignited the fear that their pockets “could carry something secret, something private, or something deadly.”\n\n        Fendi’s runway show on September 20, 2018, featured some huge pockets.\n\n        Victor Virgile/Getty Images\n\n        Fendi’s runway show on September 20, 2018, featured huge pockets, seen here on Bella Hadid.\n\n        Victor Virigle/Getty Images\n\nAt Fendi’s runway show in Milan on Thursday, designer Karl Lagerfeld did a tidy job mashing up historical pocket trends. While walking the runway, model Bella Hadid wore black bicycle shorts, a creamy button-down shirt with pockets hanging to her hips, and a belt with a number of dangling pouches (an accessory that, like the fanny pack, has been trending elsewhere, too).\n\nHadid’s belt looks like a modern-day utility belt, but it also mimics the look of a medieval belt strapped with pouches. Her shirt’s big, swaggy pockets, however, looked totally modern. Lagerfeld could have stopped there, but he also gave Hadid a leather purse to carry. That makes perfect business sense — luxury brands rely on handbag sales — and perhaps it only bolsters the look of a woman on the go. But it also complicates the historical narrative told by the rest of Hadid’s outfit.\n\nThough, it should be noted, even Hadid’s purse had extra pockets sewn on the side.\n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?

          "description": "It sounds absurd, but Democratic voters might actually be underestimating the significance of the midterm elections.    \n\nBy now, it’s well understood that the outcome will be enormously consequential for the future of Donald Trump’s presidency. But these coming elections are not just a battle to control Congress next year — they’re a battle to control it for the next decade. \n\nWhoever emerges victorious in key November races will have a huge amount of power over the next congressional redistricting — a crucial event in national politics that comes up only once every ten years. Last time around, Republicans dominated the process and walked away with such slanted district maps that they’ve held the House of Representatives easily ever since.\n\n“The next decade is essentially on the ballot in the fall of 2018,” David Daley, an author who wrote a book about the last redistricting, told me. “And if Democrats don’t win key elections this fall that allow them to have seats at the table in 2021, the party could face another decade in the wilderness.”\n\nThe specific reason this year’s contests matter so much is that hundreds of the politicians who will have a say in redistricting in key states — mostly governors and state senators in places like Ohio, Michigan, and Florida — will be elected and locked in to serve four-year terms. That is: they’ll be the people who will redraw the lines in 2021. So the more of these races Democrats win, the better positioned they’ll be to to wipe out the existing, heavily pro-Republican House and state legislature maps in all these states.\n\nFew of these races feature candidates who’ve gained viral fame, and most of them continue to fly under the radar nationally — but they’ll be incredibly consequential. “So many people don’t understand that around 800 legislators elected this year will draw the lines,” says Jessica Post of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nWe’re currently living amidst the consequences of Democrats losing the redistricting game. Republicans dominated these key elections before the 2010 maps were drawn, and they took full advantage of their triumph. Their triumphs in governor’s races and state legislatures across the country allowed them to lock their newfound House of Representatives majority in place, and build in similar advantages in state legislative maps too. \n\nThese maps have made it extremely difficult for Democrats to win majorities ever since — in the House in 2012, even winning more votes nationwide left the party well in the minority. That could change this year, but only if Democrats win the popular vote not just narrowly but overwhelmingly.\n\nAnd Democrats’ woes are broader than just gerrymandered House maps. Institutional features of the Senate and presidential contests appear to disadvantage them too, posing the risk of an anti-majoritarian political crisis.\n\nReformers held out hope that the Supreme Court would restrict partisan gerrymandering, but justices have so far avoided the issue. So it’s now clear Democrats’ only path toward reversing the GOP’s structural advantage in the House is to win back power in the states, through hundreds of specific races, a large share of which take place this year. \n\nThe good news, in Democrats’ eyes, is that this time around they have a plan — and, if a blue wave does materialize in November, it would go a long way toward helping them execute it.\n\nDemocrats got crushed in redistricting last time\n\nDemocratic operative Kelly Ward had an up-close view of the last redistricting disaster for her party while it was unfolding, back in early 2010, just two years into Barack Obama’s presidency. (Don’t confuse her with Kelli Ward, the Republican who just lost an Arizona Senate primary.) \n\nWard had just taken a job at the DCCC, the party’s committee for House of Representatives campaigns. She says she was brought in because the situation for the party — which then controlled the House — looked so dire that Democrats needed more help.\n\nThe economy was in grim shape, with unemployment near 10 percent, and President Obama and his new health care law were both unpopular. “You had a lot of incumbents getting very scary polling,” Ward recounts. “Some hadn’t been in trouble in 20 years.”\n\nThis terrible political climate came at the worst possible time — not only could Democrats lose big in 2010, but the specific contests up that year meant that loss could doom the party in 2011’s redistricting as well. The problem was that while Democrats were struggling to try and hold onto their majorities in Congress, many lower-profile state legislature races were also on the docket around the country — but getting far less attention and money.\n\n“By that point, everyone’s house was on fire,” recalls Carolyn Fiddler, who then worked at the DLCC, the party’s state seat campaign committee. “Soliciting resources for this long-term, esoteric thing was incredibly difficult. There was a general lack of awareness on the part of progressives about what these downballot races meant for the next 10 years of policies.” \n\nThe wave turned out to be a tsunami. Democrats lost a staggering 63 House seats, tipping control to Republicans. This dashed Obama’s hopes of passing any more sweeping liberal laws the remaining two years of his first term.\n\nIn state elections, though, the news was even worse. “I call the 2010 election the longest night of my life,” Fiddler, who now works for Daily Kos Elections, says. “Knowing what those results meant for the next decade of American politics was incredibly depressing.”\n\nDemocrats lost six governorships on net, and nearly 700 state legislature seats. But their true disaster was in where those losses were concentrated: in swing states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida, where the GOP gained total political control. These were the states that mattered most for redistricting — and Republicans could now redraw maps there while cutting Democrats out of the process entirely.\n\nThat’s exactly what they did — often through secretive and legally dubious methods, as Daley chronicled in his book, Ratf**ked. In Michigan, a GOP staffer enthusiastically emailed about cramming “ALL of the Dem garbage” into certain districts. In Ohio, Republicans spent months secretly map-drawing in a hotel room they called the “Bunker.” In Florida, the GOP set up a phony public redistricting process for show, and made the real decisions in a “shadow” operation behind the scenes.\n\nAll this paid off spectacularly — aided by gerrymandered maps (and, some analysts argue, the geography of where each party’s voters happen to live), the GOP has held the House easily ever since, even when they won fewer votes in House races nationwide, as in 2012. This killed any hope of more liberal legislation under President Obama, and allowed President Trump’s tax bill to become law. \n\nThe House even helped make President Trump: Aggressive investigations by the Republican majority helped unearth the email scandal that dogged and perhaps doomed Clinton’s presidential campaign. Since then, that same Republican majority has been mostly uninterested in seriously investigating the conflict-of-interest-ridden Trump presidency.\n\nAll in all, Republicans have now controlled the House of Representatives for 20 of the past 24 years. Analysts believe the built-in GOP advantage in the House maps means Democrats need a 6-or 7-point popular vote victory just to narrowly retake the chamber. Simply winning more votes nationwide, as the party did in 2012, doesn’t even get them close. Even beating Republicans by 5 percentage points nationwide could still mean Democrats fall short. \n\nHow to win the game of redistricting\n\n        Kelly Ward, of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, reviews the state level races that helped Republicans dominate the last redistricting process.\n\n        Christina Animashaun/Vox\n\nLeading Democrats are well aware that the party leadership inexcusably dropped the ball on redistricting last time around. So in October 2016, a group of Democratic leaders — led by former Attorney General Eric Holder — decided to do something about it. \n\nThey announced the launch of a new group called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee — acronymed in Washington’s alphabet soup style as the NDRC.\n\nThe new group would be the frontline organization tasked with preparing, coordinating and strategizing for that next redistricting, giving them a five-year head start. “This unprecedented effort will ensure Democrats have a seat at the table to create fairer maps after 2020,” Holder said at the time.\n\nKelly Ward is now the NDRC’s executive director — making her, essentially, the person in charge of making sure of repeating last time’s devastating result for the party doesn’t happen again.\n\n“The 2018 map is a perfect storm in all the right places. The races are in the most important states,” Ward said. When we met several months ago, she laid out Democrats’ plan to avoid to repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\n“We came in knowing that we needed to develop a comprehensive plan,” she said.\n\nThere are four basic elements.\n\n1. Get the courts to rule that the maps are unfair\n\nThe first prong of the strategy, and one that could produce immediate results, is litigation — that is, suing over maps the party believed to be rigged against Democrats, to try and get them struck down by judges.\n\nProgressive or reformist groups like the NAACP and League of Women Voters have been filing such lawsuits for many years, often citing racial discrimination. Recently, though, suits have been filed challenging partisan gerrymandering too — and have resulted in some surprising successes.\n\nFor example, in Pennsylvania this year, the state Supreme Court threw out one of the most blatant partisan gerrymanders in the country on these grounds, and instituted a new map that hugely improved Democrats’ chances to pick up House seats there. And a court recently ruled North Carolina’s map is unconstitutional, too, though the maps may not be redrawn for this year’s elections.\n\nYet the prospects for national litigation darkened considerably in June, with the one-two punch of a Supreme Court punt on a major partisan gerrymandering case, followed by the retirement of the swing vote on the issue, Justice Anthony Kennedy. His replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, will likely join his conservative colleagues in refusing to limit partisan gerrymandering.\n\n2. Reform the process, state by state\n\nThe second plank of the NDRC’s strategy, then, is trying to rewrite the rules for redistricting itself in various states.\n\nIn places where the legislature itself seems too hopelessly gerrymandered for Democrats to have a prayer of taking control before 2021, the NDRC thinks a total overhaul of the process is the best way to improve the party’s odds.\n\nThe group’s preferred reform is to take redistricting out of the partisan legislature’s hands altogether and give the job to an independent commission. A handful of states, like California and Arizona, have already gone this route. \n\nNaturally, though, existing GOP state legislative majorities tend to want to hold on to their control of redistricting. So Democrats and nonpartisan reformers have often tried to go around them by asking for the voters to approve reform, through a statewide referendum. “You can’t get other types of reform through these legislators,” Ward said.\n\nThere are a few redistricting ballot initiatives up for a vote this November, but by far the most nationally important is Michigan. Both the US House map and state legislature maps there are badly gerrymandered in the GOP’s favor. Now, the proposal going before Michigan’s voters would set up an independent commission of 13 ordinary citizens (four Republicans, four Democrats, and five independents) chosen at random from applicants — a massive change from a process dominated by politicians.\n\nBut there’s a danger to the commission strategy. Back in 2015, four conservative Supreme Court justices voted to strike down Arizona’s independent redistricting body, saying the US Constitution guaranteed state legislatures must be involved in redistricting (rather than being cut out through a ballot initiative reform). The Court’s five-justice majority upheld the independent redistricting body, but only with the vote of Justice Kennedy, who has since retired. A more conservative majority could conceivably strike down redistricting commissions nationwide.\n\n3. Get the tools needed to do redistricting right\n\nThird in the NDRC’s strategy, Ward says, is the preparation for the nitty-gritty work of the redistricting itself.\n\nBasically, Democrats want their party to have the best mapping software, to do their best to make sure the Census doesn’t go off the rails, and to make sure advocates are informed and active enough to make their voices heard when the maps are being debated. These, Ward says, are the “building blocks” to succeeding in redistricting. This work has begun behind the scenes, but much of it still lies ahead, in hopes of a 2021 payoff.\n\n4. Win the key elections\n\nFinally the fourth part of the NDRC’s plan — and perhaps most consequential — is Democrats have to actually win. \n\n“We’re looking at the map through a redistricting lens and being very intentional about where we need to get Democrats elected in order to check Republican power,” Ward said. \n\nSpecifically, these key elections are for the members of the state house, state senate, and (usually) governors in the 37 states where politicians redraw the congressional maps.\n\nAll in all, about 1,500 state senators and 4,400 state House members get to vote on new maps. Thirty-five of these states also elect governors who can veto a map. Broadly speaking, it is these races that are the electoral battlegrounds for redistricting. \n\nBut not all states are created equal. Redistricting is most nationally consequential in states that have two features: they’re populous and they’re politically divided. More populous states are more important for the House balance of power, since they have more representatives. Meanwhile, swing states matter most because it’s possible, with a creative gerrymander, to turn a 50-50 state to one that sends a 75-25 delegation in Congress. \n\nLast year, the Brennan Center released a report assessing just where the GOP’s advantage in House maps was concentrated, and they found it derived mostly from seven states: Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (before the state supreme court struck down the map), Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. Some other analysts have added Wisconsin. \n\nJackpot, shutout, or something in between?\n\nStates like these are the crucial ones Democrats need to win — or at least not get shut out in. And depending on how the various races play out, there are several possible outcomes in each.\n\nThe jackpot: If one party ends up in control of the state House, the state Senate and the governorship at redistricting time, they’ve hit the jackpot. This is called the “trifecta,” and if a party gets it at the right time, they can draw maps without needing to give their rivals any say. (Another way to effectively hit the jackpot is by just winning a veto-proof majority in both state legislative chambers.)\n\nLast time around, Republicans won oh-so-many jackpots. They came out of the 2010 midterms with trifectas in nearly every big swing state — Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and (after 2011) Virginia. In North Carolina, the GOP effectively had a jackpot too, since they controlled the legislature, and that state is one of the few that gives its governor no role in redistricting.\n\nThe shutout: Conversely, the worst-case scenario for a party is to be on the opposite end of a trifecta — winning neither the governorship, state House, or state Senate. \n\nThis is what happened to Democrats in so many key states after the 2010 midterms, letting Republicans gerrymander them to their hearts’ content.\n\nSplit partisan control: Finally, there’s the potential for a partisan split among the three key bodies. The key thing to keep in mind here is that, in most of these states, the new map needs to pass both chambers of the legislature, and be signed by the governor, to become law. You need all three, or else there’s no deal, and the courts impose a map.\n\nSo if a party wins even one of those three — the governorship, state House, or state Senate — they’ll avoid the disaster of a shutout, and guarantee themselves a seat at the table (or at least effective veto power) for redistricting.  \n\nThis is particularly important in states where Republicans held the trifecta last time, and wound up aggressively gerrymandering. If Democrats can manage to win even one of the three key bodies in these states this time, they’d be able to force dramatic changes in the existing maps. \n\nThat’s why Virginia’s elections last year were more important than you might think. The state Assembly and state Senate remain in GOP hands, but Democrat Ralph Northam won the governorship. His four-year term means he’ll be in office through 2021, and likely to veto any congressional map that seems skewed against his party — including the current one, drawn by a Republican trifecta. “That was the first victory,” says Ward.\n\nWhy 2018 is so important for the 2021 redistricting\n\nThe electoral battle for redistricting dominance isn’t a one-off contest. It’s a multi-year slog of trench warfare that began in Virginia last year, and will spread to many other states this fall, and last for two more years after that.\n\nYet 2018 matters so much because, even though redistricting is still years off, many of the specific people elected this fall will actually draw the lines in the states that matter most.\n\nThese are governors and state senators, who mostly tend to serve four-year terms. Twenty-six governors and nearly 500 state senators with a role in redistricting will be on the ballot in 2018, elected to four-year terms, and “locked in” past 2021. (The rest — mostly state house members, and the rest of the state senators — will mostly be on the ballot in 2020.)\n\nThe most important of these lock-in 2018 races are:\n\nThe governorships of Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, and Georgia\n\nThe entire state Senate in Michigan\n\nHalf the state Senates in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas\n\nNeither party will get another bite at the apple for these races before redistricting. \n\nThe governors: Democrats’ best shot\n\nDemocrats’ realistic best-case scenario to get a seat at the table in any GOP-dominated state may be winning just one race: the governorship. “If Democrats win one statewide race in what looks like it could be a wave year, they can assure themselves at least of veto power” in 2021, Daley says. (After all, the governor’s race is a statewide contest, meaning Democrats don’t have to deal with gerrymandered borders.)\n\nIn Daley’s view, “The most important elections for Democrats this November would be the governorships of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida.”\n\nThese are states that should be swing states, but in which Republicans have gerrymandered state legislature maps too, making it extraordinarily difficult for Democrats to win state House or state Senate majorities. \n\nCurrently, Democrats look competitive in all five of these contests. \n\nThey already hold Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Wolf is running for reelection. He’s currently holding a 15-point lead over his opponent, Scott Wagner, in polling averages.\n\nIn Florida’s open seat contest, Andrew Gillum, a progressive who hopes to be the state’s first black governor, is facing off against Trump-backed Ron DeSantis.  \n\nIn Ohio’s open seat contest, former consumer protection bureau director Richard Cordray is Democrats’ nominee. He appears to be in a tight race against former Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.\n\nFormer state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer recently clinched the nomination in Michigan, and polls have shown her ahead of GOP nominee Bill Schuette.\n\nFinally, Democrats are at last seeing an opening against Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin, whose poll numbers are low as the state’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers attempts to finally defeat him. \n\nWinning the governorship in any of these states would guarantee Democrats a seat at the table in redistricting. (You can also arguably add the Georgia and Texas governor’s races to this list, though they are redder states. Stacey Abrams has energized Democrats in Georgia, but in Texas, few give Democratic nominee Lupe Valdez good odds against incumbent Republican Greg Abbott.)\n\nThe next best thing: flipping key state senates\n\nNext in importance are those hundreds of lock-in state senators — many of whom will be elected in districts that are themselves gerrymandered. \n\nWith so much seeming anti-Trump energy, and many Democrats newly motivated to run for office, the party smells opportunity even in downballot races —  a rare opportunity to overcome a structural disadvantage with the help of a hoped-for blue wave.\n\nThe entire Michigan state senate is on the ballot for four-year terms — Republicans currently hold a 27-11 advantage there, but most of their caucus is prevented from running again due to term limits, so Democrats are optimistic about making a strong showing.\n\nThe GOP is up 18-15 in Wisconsin’s state senate, 23-16 in Florida’s, 34-16 in Pennsylvania’s, and 24-9 in Ohio’s. Half the seats in each chamber are up in 2018 (with the rest in 2020). Democrats’ chances for an outright takeover look best in Wisconsin and Florida. \n\nMoving to the redder states, Georgia’s entire state legislature has two year terms so there are no lock-in races. But half of the Republican-dominated Texas state senate is up in 2018.\n\nLast but not least: Make other gains in state legislatures \n\nFinally, there are hundreds of other state legislature races that will be on the ballot in 2018, but for two-year terms — meaning they’ll face election again before redistricting. These aren’t lock-in races, but Democrats are hoping to make as much progress as they can here, so their candidates can gain the benefits of incumbency and send longtime formidable Republican incumbents off into retirement. \n\nFor an example, take the Virginia House of Delegates. All its seats were on the ballot in 2017, and Democrats fell agonizingly short of a takeover, ending with 49 seats to Republicans’ 51 (with one tied race determined by drawing a name from a bowl). But all those seats will be up for election again in 2019. And the massive 15-seat gain Democrats already made means a takeover is much closer to their reach next time around, in part because since so many longtime GOP incumbents are already out of the way. \n\n“I’m the most pessimistic one in our office, because I’ve been burned so many times,” Ward says. “Who knows if some of these chambers are possible under the current environment? But we have a few years.”\n\n        Kelly Ward and José Morales Jr., community engagement and projects director at the National Democratic Redistricting Committee\n\n        Christina Animashaun/Vox\n\nA crisis of democracy?\n\nBack in 2010, the main Republican group focused on winning the redistricting game — “REDMAP” — was perfectly clear about what it wanted: partisan advantage. REDMAP’s website bragged that the party could “create 20-25 new Republican Congressional Districts through the redistricting process.” Their goal was to draw lines that would help their party win. \n\nIn one sense, the efforts of the NDRC and Democrats are a similar partisan project. But when you talk to people involved, they express more high-minded motivations. After years of struggling with what they feel are unfair rules, what they want, they say, is for things to be fair.\n\n“Our goal is fair maps that reflect the will of the people,” Ward says. “We don’t want the outcome in 2022 to be a bunch of gerrymandered Democratic maps that break democracy in our favor.” \n\nRepublicans, of course, could be forgiven for some skepticism on their sincerity. Democrats have often eagerly gerrymandered where they have happened to hold power, like in Maryland in 2010. And it’s not idealists who would truly be in charge of redrawing the lines should Democrats regain power in these states, but self-interested politicians. We will have to wait and see how that turns out.\n\nYet this issue of “fairness” in the United States electoral system now goes broader than just House district maps. \n\nDonald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2 percentage points — getting nearly 3 million votes fewer than she got — and is only president because of our bizarre Electoral College system. That’s not an aberration; this was was the second time in the past five presidential elections that the Republican candidate won despite getting fewer votes than the Democrat.\n\nSimilarly, the Senate systematically advantages smaller, whiter, more rural states — 60 senators represent states Trump won. If our politics become more racially polarized, or split more along a rural/urban divide, the Senate could soon become an institution systematically slanted in Republicans’ favor.\n\nThis bias in presidential and Senate contests can wind up creating an imbalance on the Supreme Court — an institution that one would think might offer checks on the other two. Trump, a president who was elected with fewer votes than his opponent, has already gotten to appoint two justices, confirmed by a narrow Republican Senate majority (which refused to even hold a vote on Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016).\n\nAnd then there’s the House. It was designed to be the most majoritarian body in the federal government — in contrast to the stuffy Senate and the elector-chosen president, it was supposed to have “an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people,” as Federalist Paper Number 52 reads. But now, deliberate gerrymandering has given Democrats a structural disadvantage there, too.\n\nTrends can be ephemeral, and political coalitions can change unpredictably. Yet if every electoral institution of the federal government of the United States of America has indeed developed to consistently disadvantage the Democratic Party from winning power even when it wins more votes, that’s an enormous problem — a problem that could one day become a crisis .\n\nThis next redistricting battle — starting in November, as Democrats try to win the races that will let them redraw the next decade’s maps — might provide a path toward staving off that crisis. To do that, though, the party has to win.\n",

          "description": "Asia’s worst-performing currency is simply unable to break its fall.\n\nOn Sept. 03 the rupee closed below the Rs71 per dollar mark for the first time ever. This came a mere 18 days after it ended below the key Rs70 threshold. Since January, the Indian currency has already depreciated by 10%.\n\nThe news that the Indian economy grew at a sprightly 8.2% in the April-June period, the highest in nine quarters, provided some cushion, but only so much. “…with the environment we are in right now, the rupee is more likely to track global cues,” IFA Global, a forex advisory firm, said in a report.\n\nHere are some reasons for the rupee’s incessant slide.\n\nThe triggers\n\nCrude prices: In the past many weeks, international crude oil price, which had stabilised in the April-June quarter, has been on the rise again. In the last fortnight alone, it gained $7 per barrel and the crude oil futures were trading above $75 per barrel on Sept. 03. Considering that India imports nearly 80% of its fuel needs, rising oil prices leads to a higher dollar bill which, in turn, weakens the rupee.\n\nCurrent account deficit: Rising oil prices and a weakening rupee mean that India’s current account deficit may widen to 2.8% of the GDP this financial year, up from 1.9% last year, according to a report by Nomura Research. This year, the deficit has already jumped to nearly a five-year high of $18 billion. This only adds further pressure on the rupee.\n\nInternational developments: The situation in Turkey is taking a toll on currencies of the emerging markets. Lira, the Turkish currency has already lost over 40% of its value this year. Last month, the US imposed higher tariffs on imports of steel, aluminium, and other commodities from Turkey which has set off turbulence in the latter’s economy.\n\nBesides the US-Turkey confrontation, there is also the bigger US-China trade war brewing. The two countries have also been increasing duties on each other’s goods. Some observers view this as the beginning of a new Cold War.\n\nNone of this augurs well for the Indian currency.\n\nPassive RBI: Typically, when the rupee weakens, the central bank sells dollars from its reserves to rescue it. So far, though, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not intervened aggressively to shore up the domestic currency.\n\n“The intensity of RBI’s intervention has dissipated,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, India’s biggest private lender. “While there is complete lack of communication from the RBI, comments from officials from the government and quasi-government agencies appear to give the impression that they support this fall in the rupee’s value in the interests of competitiveness.”\n\nUS economy: The dollar is having a good run this year due to an uptick in the US’s GDP numbers. That country’s economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter of this year, the fastest since late 2014. It has also been adding more jobs while average wages have picked up, too.\n\nBy all indications, most of these global cues are unlikely to change much in the immediate future. So businesses and individuals in India need to brace themselves.\n",

However, Marriott has since made a few viable paths for those looking to get top-tier lifetime elite status.\n\nTo understand how this will all work, you first have to realize that the merger is effectively broken into two parts, with some changes not taking effect until 2019. Through the end of this year, you can book top-tier hotels at reduced rates and rebook hotels using new Marriott points, but other parts of the programs are still in flux.\n\nPeople who are transferring lifetime status to the new program are impacted by this two-part rollout method. When you combine your Marriott and SPG accounts, lifetime elite members from either program will have one of three lifetime status levels for the rest of 2018 — Silver, Gold or Platinum. For those who want to make sure they’re grandfathered into the new Lifetime Premier Platinum status in 2019, you’ll need to fall into one of these four groups:\n\nCurrent Marriott Rewards Lifetime Platinum members.\n\nLifetime SPG Platinum members with 750 or more nights by December 31, 2018.\n\nMarriott members who reached 750 nights + 2 million base points at legacy Marriott properties by December 31, 2018.\n\nAny Marriott/SPG/Ritz member who reached 750 nights + 10 years of Platinum status across the combined portfolio by December 31, 2018 (meaning someone with 250 nights and 5 years of SPG Platinum and 500 nights and 5 years of Platinum with Marriott would end up as a Lifetime Platinum Premier).\n\nIn Roger’s case, since he’s already a Marriott Lifetime Platinum, he’ll get Lifetime Premier Platinum status automatically, but he won’t receive his new lifetime status until next year. For any Lifetime Platinums who might not currently meet one of the above criteria, you still have until December 31 to get there. And if you’re not sure how your specific lifetime status will translate into the new program, you can read TPG Editor-at-Large Nick Ewen’s guide to “Lifetime Status With the New Marriott: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”\n\nThanks for the question, Roger, and if you’re a TPG reader who’d like us to answer a question of your own, tweet us at @thepointsguy, message us on Facebook or email us at info@thepointsguy.com.

It is intended to be a truly universal global interface where users of all abilities and locales can have the same high-quality experience.\n\nABOUT\n\nTrapOS is a productivity and performance driven mobile operating system designed for simplicity and ease of use across cultural and physical boundaries. It is intended to be a universal global interface where users of all abilities and locales share the same high-quality experience.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nWhen phones have an extremely low battery level, they can go into what is called Battery Trap Mode. This auxiliary mode can only support rudimentary operations with very low processing and power needs.\n\nThe goal was to create a complete operating system that could run entirely in Battery Trap Mode; hence the name TrapOS.\n\nThough we may never achieve a fully functional OS in such extreme conditions, the pursuit is noble. There is always a premium on performance and battery life.\n\nGains in performance and battery life can improve existing devices as well as resurrecting devices that were once obsolete. Product life cycles are extended and older devices are relevant again – potentially having a positive environmental impact.\n\nThis could also lower the entry price point for smartphone ownership, putting technology in economies where it was once out of reach.\n\nNO BRANDING, NO BIAS\n\nWe realized very early that creating a universal operating system would require us to remove any branding and other potential biases.\n\nLuckily, most branding was removed in our text-only system –omitting any branding via app icon artwork.\n\nRoboto Monospace was our chosen. Roboto because it is readily available on most Android devices Monospace was critical because all characters are equally spaced. This removes any spatial bias between characters – ensuring that any offenses or misinterpretations are merely coincidental.\n\nTEXT AS TECHNOLOGY\n\nMany people don't consider text as technology but there are many benefits to using a text only system. Here are a few to consider:\n\n1. Text on a black background has far fewer illuminated pixels and much lower power consumption.\n\n2. Rendering text takes less processing power than graphics. As a result, TrapOS has better performance and increased stability.\n\n3. White text on black has the highest contrast ratio possible. This maximizes legibility for all users.\n\n4. Apps are ordered alphabetically. This method of organization is used by many cultures and has withstood the test of time.\n\n5. Text scales uniformly with no customization to base Android. Its supports users of all visual needs.\n\n6. Localization is standard on all text in Android, making translation effortless.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nBy switching to a text-only system, we realized that we had an opportunity to simplify the architecture of the apps as well. Currently, smartphones use an arbitrary system or a most-frequently-used model. We felt like a single alphabetized list was the most simple, intuitive, and democratic strategy.\n\nPROTOTYPE\n\nAs a prototype, we explored removing all graphic elements including system navigation and status bar iconography. This proved to be problematic because controls, percentages, and fractions do not translate into text elegantly. We realized that if we retreated a bit from this hardline text-only stance that it would actually be more intuitive and reduce cognitive load.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nThe use of a single alphabetized list for apps with system iconography for status and navigation proved to be the most elegant compromise for text and graphic delineation.\n\nUNEXPECTED RESULT\n\nAn unexpected result of TrapOS is that users are required to be more deliberate in their actions – freeing them of visual traps and improving digital health. This is a delightful revelation in the face of cognitive hijacking and unwanted digital addiction.\n\nPOTENTIAL MARKETS\n\nPeople who prefer simplicity - Kids who are addicted to their phones - Adults who worry about digital health - Software engineers who like text UIs - People who are productivity driven - Anyone who need increased legibility - People who use many languages - People who are not tech savvy - Work devices, not social devices - Low cost devices\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nVisit the Core77 Design Awards website to view the 2018 Interaction Honorees\n",

The clerk showed me a screen where I could double-check my data, and I saw that she had accidentally listed my gender as female. \"Can you backspace over that,\" I asked, \"or do I have to get the operation?\"\n\nAside from said operation, I think the biggest hassle of switching from male to female would be adjusting to women's clothes. Especially the lack of carrying space. The notion that females should be bereft of usable pocket space and forced to carry a dedicated, expensive storage object--whose fashionableness is meant to invite judgment from others--seems crazy to me.\n\n\"There are few things more frustrating than collecting your belongings only to realize that the pockets in your pants are too small to hold them,\" writes designer Jan Diehm and journalist-engineer Amber Thomas. \"Or worse, the fabric designed to look like a pocket is merely for decoration and doesn't open at all.\" The pair decided to get to the bottom of shallow women's pockets using data: \"[We found] complaints and anecdotes galore but little data illustrating just how inferior women's pockets really are to men's. So, we went there.\"\n\nIn an article in The Pudding, Diehm and Thomas created visualizations based on studying pockets from men and women's pants from 20 popular-in-America brands. By overlaying the pocket shapes of 80 pairs of jeans, they revealed the following:\n\nImage credit: Jan Diehm/Amber Thomas/The Pudding\n\nImage credit: Jan Diehm/Amber Thomas/The Pudding\n\nThey also created an interactive to show how some commonly-carried items do (or don't) fit into each gender's pocket:\n\nImage credit: Jan Diehm/Amber Thomas/The Pudding\n\nWe don't want to steal all of The Pudding's images, and there are plenty more that we recommend you read on their site: Skinny jeans vs. straight, front pockets and rear pockets, a breakdown by brand and more.\n\n\"Pockets, unlike purses, are hidden, private spaces,\" the pair concluded. \"By restricting the space in which women can keep things safe and retain mobility of both hands, we are also restricting their ability to 'navigate public spaces, to carry seditious (or merely amorous) writing, or to travel unaccompanied.'

In past American elections, losing candidates (Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain, Mitt Romney) were viewed favorably by more people than viewed them unfavorably. The 2016 election was a very unusual race in which both candidates’ favorable ratings were underwater. An unpopular opponent plus the Electoral College let Trump win despite being unpopular. \n\nAlthough Trump is unpopular with white women, he remains more popular with white women than with voters overall.\n\nWhite women like Trump more than average\n\nTrump’s 45 percent approval rating among white women isn’t very good, but it’s better than his overall national approval rating with voters of just 42 percent.\n\n        Civiqs\n\nThat said, among whites, there is a large gender gap in evaluations of Trump. While he’s modestly unpopular with white women, he is enormously popular with white men.\n\n        Civiqs\n\nCiviqs find that Hispanic men’s Trump approval rating is 6 points higher than Hispanic women’s, while the gender gap for African Americans is just 2 points. \n\nAmong white women, meanwhile, there are huge divides based on age and education.\n\nYoung women hate Trump\n\nAge has emerged as a significant partisan divide in recent cycles, and this is particularly true for white women. \n\nAmong the youngest cohort of white women, Trump’s approval rating is a pathetic 32 percent, whereas among white female senior citizens it’s a very strong 51 percent.\n\n        Civiqs\n\nThere are, similarly, significant splits by education. Just 44 percent of white women voters with college degrees approve of Trump, while an even smaller 36 percent of white women with graduate degrees approve. By contrast, among working-class white women, views are split evenly.\n\n        Civiqs\n\nDiscussions of politics are often driven by stereotypes and demographic paradigms, and as such, the predominant image of the “Trump supporter” has tended to be a working-class white man. \n\nThis is, indeed, Trump’s very best demographic and in some sense his electoral base. But in a practical sense, it’s Trump’s substantial strength among working-class white women that’s critical to his political success. Especially given Democrats’ self-conception as the party of women’s rights and women’s interests, their failure to do better with this group deserves to be seen as a central political issue. \n",

          "description": "A few days ago, I came across this rather striking finding from a recent public opinion survey by the Public Religion Research Institute:\n\nIt is striking for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the question is not about illegal immigrants, or even immigrants at all, it’s not about crime, or welfare, or jobs ... it’s just about racial diversity as such. And more Republicans are against it than for it! (So much for “economic anxiety.”) \n\nBut the question is also notable for its unstated premise: that the growing presence of people other than whites in the US (what else could “increased racial diversity” mean in a majority white country?) is a subject of active political debate. It is not taken for granted as constitutive of a multiethnic democracy, but treated as a kind of add-on, an extra feature. “Is it working? Maybe we should roll it back. Let’s discuss.”\n\nI tried to imagine how that question might strike, oh, someone whose grandparents immigrated from Uganda. That person is just as much a citizen as any other American. She did not choose to be black and cannot choose to be some other race. But now she hears that it is, at the very least, an open question whether her very presence — and her choice to have children, to further diversify America — is detrimental to her country. Is it bad to have her around at all, because she’s black? Let’s discuss.\n\nIt must be alienating to feel like one is on probation in one’s own country, that one’s presence is subject to the approval of white people. And it must be a familiar feeling, especially these days, for everyone who is not white (and male).\n\nIt occurred to me that white people rarely if ever experience questions like this, about their very legitimacy. Do they belong? Is having more of them around good for America?\n\nOne thing white people have never experienced is a poll on whether their presence in their own country is intrinsically detrimental.\n— David Roberts (@drvox) July 24, 2018\n\nIn fact, I thought to myself, I bet asking the question at all — not answering it either way, just asking it — would make a lot of white people flip out. Imagine if they saw that on a poll! \n\nSo, as a bit of goofy provocation, I made just such a poll:\n\nDo white people have a positive or negative effect on America?\n— David Roberts (@drvox) July 24, 2018\n\nI should have said “impact,” not “effect,” to mirror the original poll question. (Twitter really needs some kind of edit feature.) It was not the best zinger ever, and probably not a very constructive way to make a point, but whatever, it was only a tweet. I went and walked my dog.\n\nAs you’ve likely predicted, a lot of white people flipped out. \n\nBy the time I got home, the poll had spread into Trump land, the thread was flooded with MAGA tweeters, and white people were being decisively vindicated in the poll. By Wednesday morning, I was the outrage of the day on the entertainment site The Wrap and on a couple of right-wing news sites. \n\nFor reasons that remain somewhat mysterious to me, the MAGA brigade seems to view their victory in my poll — as of closing, 82 percent deem white people’s net impact as positive, so congrats to my fellow white people! — as a grand self-own on my part. Presumably because I cared about this poll, wanted white people to lose, and assumed my followers would send them down to defeat.\n\nThose erroneous assumptions and many more are reflected in the Twitter thread beneath the poll, which I recommend to anyone with a masochistic streak. The words “cuck” and “soy boy” come up a lot, as well as a wide variety of colorful anatomical suggestions.\n\nThe funny thing is, I never said a disparaging word about white people. I only said that, while other groups are accustomed to being discussed and polled and judged, white people aren’t, and they would freak out if they saw a question like the one in the PRRI poll about themselves. \n\nThen they saw one, completely missed the context, and freaked out, right on cue, thus proving my point in real time. But they won my Twitter poll, so ... burn, I guess?\n\nIt’s all pretty silly. In 24 hours, everyone involved will have moved on to being outraged about something else. The only lesson I feel certain about: Twitter is terrible, and no one should ever tweet again, even though we all know we’re going to.\n\nBut maybe there’s a little insight to be gleaned. I do think the reaction illuminates a larger point.\n\n        Shutterstock\n\n“You’re the real racist, and white people rule”\n\nI kept up with the first few hundred responses (there are over a thousand now), and it’s interesting to see what they shared and where they differed.\n\nSubstantively (if you can call it that), there were two basic reactions. One is to say that I’m a racist, or liberals are the real racists, because they keep calling attention to race and dividing people up by race, while conservatives are just trying to be individuals and judge people by the content of their character. It’s the “No puppet! You’re the puppet!” of racism.\n\nThe other kind of response was, to paraphrase: Of course white people are good for America, white people are America, and America, like every other shithole nation white people conquered, would still be a shithole if not for white people.\n\n(I’m not going to pluck out individual tweets and embed them here because I don’t want to drag individuals on Twitter into a public dispute like this; you can read the thread to see if I’m characterizing it accurately.)\n\nThese are mutually contradictory points, of course. “You’re the real racist, and white people rule.” But they are both very familiar in conservative rhetoric and both delivered behind the same aesthetic, using the same keywords, in the same jumbled tone of fury and contempt. \n\nI didn’t answer the question I asked, but asking it was enough to trigger all the same outrage. Why is that?\n\n        Shutterstock\n\nRacial “priming” happens well before racial decline\n\nOn his podcast, Vox’s Ezra Klein recently interviewed Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson, noting she “has done pioneering work on the way perceptions of demographic threat and change affect people’s political opinions, voting behavior, and ideas about themselves.” \n\nOne of Richeson’s key insights is that reminders of coming demographic decline — the notion that America will soon become a “majority minority” country, with people of color outnumbering whites — not only cause increased hostility toward other racial groups (which might be expected) but also push white people in a conservative direction on seemingly unrelated policy questions like tax rates and oil drilling. \n\nShe also makes the point that the majority-minority narrative is bogus. By the time it is forecast to happen, who-knows-what demographic changes will have taken place, including changes in who gets coded as “white.” Since the idea is wrong and it freaks people out, she reasons, we should probably stop uncritically repeating it.\n\nStill, what recent political evidence seems to show — and my Twitter brouhaha reflects in some small way — is that the effects Richeson found kick in well before news of any demographic apocalypse arrives (if you consider being a plurality rather than a majority apocalyptic).\n\nIndeed, as research on “priming” shows, simply discussing race at all kicks up those effects among the racially dominant group. Or to put it more bluntly, in the US context: White people really don’t like being called white people. They don’t like being reminded that they are white people, part of a group with discernible boundaries, shared interests, and shared responsibilities. \n\nAfter all, one of the benefits of being in the dominant demographic and cultural group is that you are allowed to simply be a person, a blank slate upon which you can write your own individual story. You have no baggage but what you choose.\n\nIn most situations in the US, a woman is a female person. Someone part of a racial minority is a black person or a Latino person, etc. Gay people. Trans people. Immigrant people. All these groups are [adjective] people, people with an asterisk, while a white, heterosexual male is simply a person, as generic as he chooses. His presence is taken for granted; it rarely occurs to anyone to question it. A white man in khakis and a polo shirt can walk into almost any milieu in the US and, even if he’s greeted with hostility, be taken seriously. His legitimacy is assumed. \n\nThe power and privilege that come along with that — being the base model, a person with no asterisk — are invisible to many white men. Simply calling them “white people,” much less questioning the behavior or beliefs of white people, drags that power and privilege into the open.\n\n        Some white men have even been known to rise above their level of competence.\n\n        Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIdentity politics is something only white men have been allowed to avoid\n\n“Identity politics” — dragging around the baggage of one’s identity, being forced constantly to reckon with it, work around the stereotypes and discrimination it attracts, speak for it, represent it — is something that is forced on other groups, not something they choose. Do you think a young black man likes walking into a store knowing he’s already carrying the weight of a million suspicions and expectations, that he has to behave perfectly lest he invoke them? He’d probably like to be thinking about tax policy too, if he didn’t have to worry about getting shot by the cops on his way home. But that worry comes with his identity.\n\nWhite men bridle at the notion of being part of a tribe or engaging in identity politics. (Ahem.) Alone among social groups, they are allowed the illusion that they have only their own bespoke identity, that they are pure freethinkers, citizens, unburdened and uninfluenced by collective baggage (unique and precious “snowflakes,” if you will). \n\nNo one else is allowed to think that — at least not for long, before they are reminded again that they are, in the eyes of their country, little more than their identity, their asterisk. No one else gets to pretend their politics are free of identity.\n\nWhite people do. But simply saying the words “white people” is a direct attack on that illusion. It identifies, i.e., creates (or rather, exposes) an identity, a group with shared characteristics and interests. It raises questions (and doubts) about the group’s standing and power relative to other groups. It illuminates all that hidden baggage. Lots of white people really hate that.\n\nIn politics, we talk about groups all the time — minorities, immigrants, criminals, what have you — and by and large, no one blinks. The only time I get blowback is when I generalize about men or white people (okay, or baby boomers). Suddenly, “lumping people together” becomes a sin. Even among white liberal friends, I’ve noticed that merely saying the words “white people” causes a frisson of discomfort. \n\nIn fact, it’s difficult to think of a US setting in which the words “white people” are received neutrally. The term is always charged somehow, freighted with meaning and potential conflict, vaguely subversive. White people. White people. White people.\n\n        Shutterstock\n\nA shrinking group cannot avoid being reminded it is a group\n\nWhat primes white people is simply the reminder that they are white people — that they are, and will increasingly be, one group of Americans among others, with particular interests, settling differences via democracy. \n\nRight now, the white maleocracy is clinging to power, with disproportionate wealth and representation in Congress relative to its size. And all the while its leaders decry identity politics. They are used to being the default setting, people with no asterisks, no baggage, and they are extremely loath to give that up. \n\nIn fact, they want their America, the America where white dominance is so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable, back. They keep saying so. \n\nAs many have pointed out and this political era has made painfully clear, to a dominant demographic, the loss of privilege feels like persecution. Being just one group among many feels like losing. After all, what good is being white in the US, especially among poor whites, if some third-generation Ugandan immigrant has just as much control over their fate as they have over hers? If a poll asks whether they’re any good for her, rather than the other way around?\n\nFor the dominant group, being judged and asked to justify itself, as so many subaltern groups are judged and asked to justify themselves, feels like an insult. If you doubt that, go read this Twitter thread.\n",

          "description": "The Mrs. and I recently took a trip to Japan after being inspired to visit by a friend who lived there for a few years.  And after visiting, we’re ready to go back for round two!  We loved just about everything – the culture, the food, the public transportation…and the world-class toilets.\n\nBecause of the trip, I’ve had lots of friends interested in traveling to Japan.  So I thought I’d put together a little guide on how to get to Japan using transferable points.\n\nWith Your Flexible Points, You’ll Be Riding Go Karts Around Tokyo While Dressing Up in Mario Costumes in No Time!\n\nEarning transferable points is a great way to give yourself flexibility with your travel dates.  You won’t be stuck searching for available award seats or dealing with blackout dates.\n\nHow to Use Transferable Points for Flights to Japan\n\nTo keep things simple, I’ll cover the best ways to fly in and out of Tokyo.  And I won’t cover every option for every different type of flexible rewards.  Instead, I’ll review the most useful and practical transfer partners.\n\nI’ll cover the basics that will help you make an informed decision, things like:\n\nTransfer ratio:   How many points do you need to transfer to get the number of miles you need?\n\nTransfer time:   How long does it usually take to transfer your points to the airline?  This is important because you don’t want to find an award only to see it disappear while you’re waiting for the miles to show up in your account.\n\nAward Prices:   How many miles will it take to book a flight to Japan with a particular airline?\n\nPartner Award Prices:   You can use most airline miles to book award flights on their partner airlines.  For example, you can use United Airlines miles to book award seats on ANA.  However, typically airlines have different award charts for their partner airlines.  And partner award seats are usually harder to find because in many cases, you’ll only be able to book the lowest priced (i.e. Saver level) awards.  Also, sometimes airlines don’t allow partner bookings for Business or First Class seats.\n\nFuel Surcharges:   When you book an award ticket, you’ll always have to pay for taxes and fees, which can be very high depending on where you’re going (i.e. London).  But some airlines also add fuel surcharges, in addition to the taxes and fees.  This can add $100s to the ticket cost.  So I’ll let you know whether or not you can expect these types of charges with each particular airline.\n\nPros:   What are the reasons you’d want to transfer points to an airline?\n\nCons:   What are the downsides of transferring points to an airline?\n\nOther notes:   If there are any special rules, tips, or ticks you should know for the airline, they’ll be covered here.\n\nHow to Get to Japan With Chase Ultimate Rewards Points\n\nYou can earn transferable Chase Ultimate Rewards points with the following cards:\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve®\n\nInk Business Preferred℠ Credit Card\n\nAnd the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn with the following no-annual-fee cards can be pooled onto the “premium” cards listed above, and then transferred to Chase’s travel partners:\n\nChase Freedom®\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited®\n\nInk Business Cash℠ Credit Card\n\nInk Business Unlimited℠ Credit Card\n\nBritish Airways\n\nBritish Airways operates a distance-based award chart, so British Airways Avios points aren’t the most universally useful rewards for booking awards to Japan.  With British Airways, you’ll pay based on the distance of the flight segment, NOT the total flight distance.  So shorter non-stop flights can be a good deal, but if you need a connecting flight you’ll pay extra for it!\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   Instant\n\nAward Prices:   British Airways operates a distance-based award chart.  You can use the Great Circle Mapper to estimate the distance of each segment of your flight.\n\n \n\nBritish

Award Prices:   British Airways uses the same chart for their awards and partner awards unless you book a flight with 2+ or more partner airlines.  In that case, you’ll want to reference this chart.  You’ll notice that the prices aren’t good and the fees are hefty.\n\nWith almost all partner awards, you can only book the peak price.\n\nWith British Airways Avios points, you can book Japan Airlines flights under 650 miles within Japan for 4,500 Avios one-way + taxes & fees.  And from some West Coast cities, you can book one-way awards on partners like American Airlines or Japan Airlines starting at 25,000 British Airways Avios points + taxes & fees.  But your options for flying cheaply to Japan are limited.\n\nFuel Surcharges:   Yes\n\nPros:   Great for booking short-haul flights within Japan or non-stop flights from the West Coast\n\nCons:   Not good for folks who can’t fly non-stop or need to fly farther to get to Japan, higher fuel surcharges & fees on some flights\n\nOther

off-peak dates.  You can book round-trip coach flights from the US to Japan for only 70,000 Korean Air miles during off-peak times.  Typically, the off-peak dates cover ~9 months of the year!\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   2 to 7 business days, but you can hold award seats while waiting for the transfer\n\nAward Prices:   All of the award prices listed in this chart are for round-trip flights, one-way awards cost half as much:\n\nRound-Trip Award Flight Prices With Korean Air Miles\n\nKorean Air calls their Business Class “Prestige” and the peak and off-peak dates change each year.  You can check the dates here.\n\nPartner Award Prices:   \n\nKorean Air is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.  So you can use Korean Air miles to book non-stop award flights to Japan on partners like Delta.  There are no peak or off-peak prices for the partner award chart.  This is nice because you can book these awards starting at 80,000 Korean Air miles round-trip in coach, even during the busy season!\n\nBut you can NOT book one-way award flights on partner airlines.  The following chart lists the round-trip partner award price:\n\nRound-Trip Partner Award Flight Prices Using Korean Air Miles\n\nAsia 1 includes Korea & Japan.\n\nFuel Surcharges:   They do add fuel surcharges on award flights, but for Korean Air flights and Delta partner flights to Japan, the fees are reasonable.\n\nPros:   Lots of available award seats on Korean Air flights, especially Business & First Class (but recently folks have been reporting that Korean Air isn’t as generous with opening award seats as they used to be), free stopover (layover of 24+ hours) on one-way award flights (on Korean Air flights only), free stopover & 1 open jaw (flying into a city, leaving from another) on partner award flights\n\nCons:   Partner awards can be harder to find (I’m looking at you Delta), you can only book awards for specific family members\n\nOther notes:\n\nKorean Air only allows you to book awards for eligible family members.\n\nFor more tips on booking awards with Korean Air miles check out our guide!\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines miles are not particularly useful for getting to Japan.  The biggest advantage they have is how easy they are to earn.  You can transfer points from Citi ThankYou, Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, and Marriott / Starwood to Singapore Airlines.  So if you don’t have enough flexible points to get to Japan in any single program, you can easily combine points together and book award flights with Singapore Airlines miles.\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   Up to 2 days\n\nAward Prices:   Japan is in Zone 7 of the Singapore Airlines award chart.  Award flights from the West Coast are comparable in price to other options for coach flights, but Singapore Airlines only flies from Los Angeles to Tokyo.  And I’m not sure how easy it is to find available award seats.  I searched on the Singapore Airlines website for ~15 minutes and could only find partner award flights.  Maybe you’ll have better luck.\n\nOne-Way Saver Award Prices With Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nBecause of Singapore Airlines’ more restrictive routing rules, I couldn’t find flights with Singapore Airlines from the East Coast.  But even if you can find those award seats, you’re better off booking a partner award, which will cost fewer miles.  But you’ll want to pay attention to fuel surcharges with certain airlines.\n\nPartner Award Prices:   Singapore Airlines is a member of Star Alliance.  You can book awards with their partner airlines from North America to Japan for:\n\nCoach – 108,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nBusiness Class – 210,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nFirst Class – 250,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nOne-way partner awards are half the price of the round-trip partner awards.\n\nFuel Surcharges:   Singapore Airlines does not add fuel surcharges to their own flights.  But if you’re booking a partner award flight you’ll pay fuel surcharges when the airline you’re flying with has them.  Most European & Asian airlines add hefty fuel surcharges.  But others, like United Airlines, don’t have any fuel surcharges.\n\nPros:   Some of the easiest airline miles to earn as they transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, and Marriott / Starwood\n\nCons:   High cost of awards and restrictive routing rules\n\nOther notes:\n\nYou are allowed 1 stopover (layover of 24+ hours) & 1 open jaw (origin or destination is not the same) on round-trip Saver award flights\n\nYou can add stopovers on award flights for $100 each (up to 3 total), but you can’t book them online\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines prices their awards as “Saver” awards and “Everyday” awards.  Saver awards are much cheaper, so those are what you’ll want to find and book.  Everyday awards can be absurdly expensive and are typically NOT a good deal.\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   Instant\n\nAward Prices:   \n\nCoach – 35,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 80,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nBusiness Class – 70,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 175,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nFirst Class – 90,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Saver Award, up to 200,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nPartner Award Prices:\n\nCoach – 35,000 United Airlines miles one-way\n\nBusiness Class – 80,000 United Airlines miles one-way\n\nFirst Class – 110,000 United Airlines miles one-way\n\nFuel Surcharges:   No, United Airlines does not add fuel surcharges for their award flights or partner award flights!\n\nPros:   United Airlines awards are easy to find and book and typically there are lots of available award seats\n\nI Did This Search for United Airlines Award Seats From Chicago to Tokyo on July 17, 2018, and You Can See There Are Plenty of Last-Minute Seats!  Plus, It Only Gets Better the Farther Out You Search or If You Have a United Airlines Credit Card!\n\nCons:   Business & First Class partner awards and Everyday Awards are expensive!\n\nOther notes:\n\nUnited Airlines charges a booking fee of $75 for award flights booked within 21 days of departure.  But you might be able to avoid it with this trick!\n\nUnited Airlines allows a free stopover or a free one-way on round-trip award flights in the form of the “United Airlines Excursionist Perk” \n\nIf you have one of the Chase United Airlines credit cards or United Airlines elite status, you’ll have access to more available award seats!\n\nFor more on how to book awards with United Airlines miles check out our Ultimate Guide to United Airlines Miles!\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic doesn’t fly to Tokyo or Japan, but they are worth mentioning because they have one of the best options for partner award flights from the US to Japan.  And Virgin Atlantic miles are super easy to collect.\n\nTransfer ratio:   1:1\n\nTransfer time:   Instant\n\nAward Prices:   There are no Virgin Atlantic flights to Tokyo or Japan.\n\nPartner Award Prices:   Virgin Atlantic has a different award chart for each partner airline.  You can check them out here.  But the only useful partner is ANA, and when I say useful, I mean amazing!\n\nAll the prices below are for round-trip awards – you can NOT book one-way partner award flights:\n\nRound-Trip Partner Award Prices on ANA Using Virgin Atlantic Miles\n\nThose prices aren’t typos!  You can book a First Class partner award on ANA from the West Coast to Japan for only 110,000 Virgin Atlantic miles!  That’s only 2,000 miles more than what it would take for a Singapore Airlines partner award in coach!\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot book partner award flights online.  You’ll have to book them over the phone (800-365-9500).\n\nFuel Surcharges:   Yes, but the fuel surcharges on ANA flights are reasonable.  I checked a few different flights from the US to Japan and saw fuel surcharges in the $170 range, and you’ll spend an additional ~$100 in taxes & fees.\n\nPros:   Incredible ANA awards, you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, and Marriott / Starwood points to Virgin Atlantic – so they’re easy to earn!\n\nCons:   Can’t search for or book partner awards online, only one useful award flight option to Japan, fuel surcharges on award flights\n\n Other notes:\n\nYou can search for ANA awards on the United Airlines website or Air Canada’s Aeroplan site and then call Virgin Atlantic to book the flights.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJapan is one place that should be on your bucket list!  Even outside of cherry blossom season, it is one of the most beautiful and cleanest countries I’ve visited.  And the people couldn’t be more helpful!\n\nPlus, getting there doesn’t have to cost a fortune!  With transferable points, there’s no shortage of options for booking award flights.  So I’m putting together this guide on how to use flexible points to visit Japan.\n\nFor the next installment of this series, I’ll be covering how to get to Japan using AMEX Membership Rewards points.\n",

          "description": "Building a better resume\n\n posted by J.D. Roth on 18 July 2018  Leave a Comment \n\nYesterday at the Financial Careers forum on Reddit, a user named /u/unfoldcareers posted some useful advice for job-seekers. “I’ve reviewed and screened thousands of resumes,” /u/unfoldcareers writes, “and I’m sharing my preferred resume format…along with my best resume advice.”\n\nThe poster notes that “bad resume format” leads most folks to get little or nor response to their job applications. To help current job hunters, /u/unfoldcareers created a free resume template that can be downloaded via Google Docs.\n\nThe Reddit post itself contains a number of useful tips. To craft a better resume, you should:\n\nBe precise. Don’t speak in general terms, but include specific numbers and metrics. Instead of saying, “Was top salesperson at my company,” note how many people were on the sales team, how much better you performed than everybody else, and for how long.\n\nEmphasize impact. According to /u/unfoldcareers, too many people focus on their achievements when they should really emphasize the impact they had on their company or team.\n\nStick to one page — unless you really do have decades of experience.\n\nMake it scannable. “A hiring manager will review your resume for approximately 10 seconds or less,” writes /u/unfoldcareers. Be sure that they’ll be able to scan all of the important info quickly.\n\nExplain gaps. Don’t leave a mystery. If you took time off to be a stay-at-home parent, say so.\n\nRemove the “objective” line. It’s irrelevant. (I did a very little hiring for our family’s box factory. I never did understand why people put an objective on their resume.)\n\nRemove references. It’s fine to create a separate document that contains your references so that you can provide them if asked, but don’t include them on the resume itself.\n\nThe full post on Reddit includes more info, of course, along with the reasoning behind some of the recommendations.\n\nFrom my experience, most people forget is that a resume isn’t really about you. That might sound strange, but the truth is that a resume is about how well your skills and experience match an employer’s job requirements. Because of this, the best resumes are individually tailored to specific jobs.\n\nSure, you might create a “base” or “default” resume that serves as a framework when applying for work. But you’ll have greater success with your job hunt if you take the time to make subtle tweaks to this default each time you apply for a different job.\n\nAlso: I believe strongly that, whenever possible, you should hand-deliver your resume.\n\nObviously, this doesn’t work for online-only applications or for positions outside your local area. But I know that when we hired at the box factory, we paid more attention to folks who had come by in person than those who simply mailed their resume. (And from watching Kim go through a couple of job searches now, I’d say that one of the reasons she has such success is that she literally goes door to door, dropping her resume off at different dental offices.)\n\n\r\n\r\n",

          "description": "Chase issues nearly 30 different credit cards, including co-branded hotel and airline cards, but only three — two consumer and one small business card — give you full access to the company’s lucrative Ultimate Rewards program and all its airline and transfer partners. Another four cards — two business and two personal — are what you might call UR-adjacent: they’re cash-back cards that can turn into points cards when paired with one of three primary UR cards.\n\nTogether, these seven cards pack a mighty punch when it comes to generating travel rewards, whether through welcome bonuses or good, old-fashioned spending. And whether you’re applying for your first credit card or you’re a seasoned card pro looking to complement a UR card already in your wallet, one or more of these cards might be right for you, Let’s take a deep look at this program, with an analysis of each of the seven cards, what they offer, how to redeem the points and how it all fits together in the Ultimate Rewards universe.\n\nIn This Post\n\nEarning with Credit Cards\n\nFirst, here’s a quick glance at the sign-up bonus, rewards structure, annual fee and benefits for each of the seven Ultimate Rewards credit cards:\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nBonus Categories\n\nAnnual Fee\n\nPerks\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\n\n50,000 points after you spend $4,000 in the first three months\n\n3x points on travel and dining purchases\n\n$450\n\n$300 annual travel credit, a fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck, Priority Pass Select lounge access\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card\n\n50,000 points after you spend $4,000 in the first three months\n\n2x points on travel and dining purchases\n\n$95 (waived the first year)\n\nDelayed baggage insurance, trip interruption/ cancellation insurance and primary car rental insurance\n\nInk Business Preferred Credit Card\n\n80,000 points after you spend $5,000 in the first three months\n\n3x points on the first $150,000 spent in combined purchases on travel, shipping purchases, internet, cable and phone services, advertising made with social media sites and search engines each year\n\n$95\n\nCell phone protection up to $600 per claim for damage or theft\n\nChase Freedom\n\n$150 (15,000 Ultimate Rewards points) after you spend $500 in the first three months\n\n5% back/5x points on select rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 per quarter\n\n$0\n\n0% intro APR for 15 months from account opening on purchases and balance transfers, then a variable rate of 16.49% to 25.24%\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\n$150 (15,000 Ultimate Rewards points) after you spend $500 in the first three months\n\nUnlimited 1.5% back/1.5x points on every purchase\n\n$0\n\nPurchase protection, extended warranty protection, zero liability for unauthorized charges\n\nInk Business Cash Credit Card\n\n$500 (50,000 Ultimate Rewards points) after you spend $3,000 in the first three months\n\n5% back/5x points on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on cellular phone, landline, internet and cable TV services annually; 2% back/2x points on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants annually\n\n$0\n\n0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers, then a variable rate of 14.74% to 20.74%\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\n$500 (50,000 Ultimate Rewards points) after you spend $3,000 in the first three months\n\nUnlimited 1.5% back/1.5x points on every purchase\n\n$0\n\nPurchase protection, extended warranty protection, free employee cards\n\nThat’s a lot of information, so let’s take a deeper dive into each card and what each one offers.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\n\nThe crown jewel in Chase’s credit card lineup, Sapphire Reserve is packed with value that far exceeds its $450 annual fee. It’s an excellent travel rewards credit card that every frequent flyer should consider carrying in his or her pocket. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nThe 50,000-point bonus after you spend $4,000 in the first three months is worth a mammoth $1,050, according to TPG’s latest valuations. The welcome bonus alone is equivalent to more than two years of the annual fee. Note that you can have either the Sapphire Reserve or the Sapphire Preferred, but not both cards at the same time.\n\nEarning\n\nYou’ll earn 3x points per dollar spent on all travel and dining purchases worldwide and 1x points on everything else. Chase is generous with what counts as a 3x purchase for both bonus categories. For travel purchases, you’ll earn 3 points per dollar on airlines, hotels, motels, timeshares, campgrounds, car rental agencies, cruise lines, travel agencies, discount travel sites, passenger trains, buses, taxis (including Uber and Lyft), limousines, ferries, toll bridges and highways and parking lots and garages.\n\nAs for what counts as a dining purchase, essentially any establishment that serves (as opposed to sells) food or drinks counts, including bars (even ones that don’t serve food), coffee shops and restaurant delivery services. As long as a merchant classifies itself in a restaurant category when applying to accept credit cards, the purchase will qualify.\n\nPerks\n\nSapphire Reserve benefits could be worth hundreds of dollars annually. The primary benefits include:\n\nA $300 annual travel credit that will be automatically applied toward any purchases that qualify as travel.\n\nPriority Pass Select membership, which gives you access to more than 1,000 airport lounges across the world. Beginning August 26, 2018, you’ll be limited to two free guests per visit. You’ll be charged a $27 fee for each additional guest.\n\nAn application Fee Credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck once every four years. If you’re already enrolled, you can use the credit to cover a friend or family member’s application fee.\n\nVisa Infinite Perks, which include primary rental car insurance, trip cancellation and delay coverage, lost luggage reimbursement, a concierge service and access to the Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\n\nIf the Sapphire Reserve’s $450 annual fee leaves you feeling cold, the Sapphire Preferred is a great option for travel rewards. It will set you back $95, although the annual fee is waived the first year. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nLike the Sapphire Reserve, the Sapphire Preferred offers a 50,000-point bonus after you make $4,000 in purchases within the first three months. You can also earn another 5,000 bonus points by adding an authorized user and making a purchase within the first three months. Again, you can have either CSP or the CSR, but you can’t have both cards at the same time.\n\nEarning\n\nThe lower annual fee this card carries means it also offers slightly less value when it comes to rewards. You’ll earn 2x points per dollar spent on all travel and dining purchases worldwide and 1x points on everything else. The broad definitions of travel and dining purchases apply here, as well.\n\nPerks\n\nSapphire Preferred doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the Sapphire Reserve, but its list of benefits is still potentially valuable, including:\n\nPrimary rental car coverage, which means you can avoid involving your own personal auto insurance policy when loss or damage occurs. Most cards offer secondary car insurance, which means you have to first look to your own or other primary coverages, if any, before the card’s coverage will step in and cover any losses.\n\nTrip delay insurance ($500 per ticket) and trip cancellation insurance (up to $10,000). It also features $100 per day in coverage for up to five days in baggage delay insurance and up to $3,000 per person in lost luggage reimbursement.\n\nPurchase protection up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account.\n\nNote that the Reserve offers the same (or, in some cases, superior) travel protections.\n\nInk Business Preferred\n\nLaunched in 2016, the Business Preferred card is the anchor of Chase’s small business card portfolio. It does a fine job trying to offer a little something to many different kinds of businesses both in terms of its rewards and its benefits. It’s the only small business card Chase offers that is part of the Ultimate Rewards program, meaning you don’t need another credit card to take advantage of valuable Chase points. The card charges an annual fee of $95. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nEarn 80,000 Ultimate Rewards points after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. That large spending requirement comes with a large reward, the biggest currently among any Chase card. Those points are worth $1,680 based on TPG’s most recent valuations.\n\nEarning\n\nBusiness Preferred offers a diverse list of bonus categories designed to reward spending on common office purchases. Earn 3 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar on the first $150,000 spent in combined purchases per account anniversary year in the following categories:\n\nTravel, including airfare, hotels, rental cards, train tickets and taxis\n\nShipping purchases\n\nInternet, cable and phone services\n\nAdvertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines\n\nIf you max out these categories by spending the full $150,000, you’ll take home a total of 450,000 Ultimate Rewards points at a value of $9,450, a fantastic return of 6.3%. All other spending earns 1x points.\n\nPerks\n\nBusiness Preferred comes with a fairly long list of familiar Chase card benefits, including trip cancellation/interruption insurance, primary rental car coverage and purchase protection. The perk that stands out, though, is cell phone protection. When you charge your monthly cell phone bill to the card, you and eligible employees on the plan receive up to $600 per claim for damage or theft of cell phones. Claims are limited to three in a 12-month period and you must pay a $100 deductible per claim.\n\nChase Freedom\n\nThough the Freedom isn’t technically a credit card that earns Ultimate Rewards points, Chase allows users to convert Freedom’s cash-back rewards into transferable UR points when combined with the account of a card that does earn points, which are the three cards listed above. This move can turn a fee-free card that earns 5% cash back on quarterly categories into something much more powerful. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nEarn $150 cash back after you spend $500 on purchases during your first three months after account opening. You can earn an additional $25 after you add your first authorized user and make a purchase within the same three-month period. You’ll boost the value of the bonus to $315 when you convert your cash back to 15,000 points by transferring them to a Chase account that is part of the the Ultimate Rewards program.\n\nCurrent Freedom cardholders or previous cardholders who received a bonus within the last 24 months will not qualify for this offer.\n\nEarning\n\nChase Freedom has a rotating series of bonus categories that switch every quarter. Those categories pay 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined purchases. Earn 1% cash back on all other purchases. The bonus categories for July, August and September 2018 are Lyft, Walgreens and gas stations. Other recent bonus categories have included grocery stores, PayPal transactions and internet, cable and phone services.\n\nWhen earning cash back, you’ll be able to score a maximum of $75 per quarter on the bonus categories ($1,500 in purchases at 5% cash back). But if you pair the card with another Chase credit card that’s part of the Ultimate Rewards program, the points can then be transferred to Chase’s travel partners and can be worth more than double the annual value of the card’s cash-back rewards. As an example, $1,500 in purchases at 5x points equals 7,500 UR points per quarter — those points are worth $157.50, according to TPG valuations.\n\nPerks\n\nYou’ll receive some fairly standard rewards card benefits perks, including purchase protection, which covers your new purchases for up to 120 days against damage or theft up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account, and extended warranty protection, which extends the time period of a US manufacturer’s warranty by an additional year on eligible warranties of three years or less.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited eschews category bonuses for a flat cash-back rate for all purchases. As with Chase Freedom, you can transfer your rewards from this card to an account earning Ultimate Rewards to improve the redemption rate significantly. There is no annual fee. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nThe welcome bonus on the Chase Freedom and the Chase Freedom Unlimited are identical. Earn $150 cash back after you spend $500 on purchases during your first three months after account opening and an additional $25 after you add your first authorized user and make a purchase within the same three-month period.\n\nEarning\n\nThe card earns a flat 1.5% cash back on all purchases, which can be converted to 1.5 Ultimate Rewards points when paired with a UR card. That makes the total return 3.15% when transferred, according to TPG’s latest valuations.\n\nInk Business Cash\n\n(Photo by Eric Helgas for The Points Guy)\n\nThe Ink Business Cash offers generous returns on a broad spectrum of office expenses — from supplies to utility services — without charging users an annual fee for the privilege. It’s a cash-back card, but (once again) can be converted to a UR-earning machine if you own one of the three Ultimate Rewards cards Chase issues. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nEarn $500 cash back after you, spend $3,000 in the first three months after account opening. Pair up the card and turn that bonus into 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points worth $1,050.\n\nEarning\n\nEarn 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable, cellular phone and landline services each account anniversary year (then 1%). Earn 2% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account anniversary year (then 1%) and 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nHowever, you can boost your rate on the 5% cash back categories to an effective return of 10.5% (based on TPG’s valuations) if you move your points to another Chase card with Ultimate Rewards and transfer to one of the 13 Chase travel partners described below. At that rate, if you max out the 5% category and convert the rewards to points, your return is worth as much as $2,625.\n\nPerks\n\nYou won’t find any of the airport-related perks associated with some premium travel rewards credit cards. Instead, Ink Cash offers a number of modest benefits offered on other Chase cards, including purchase protection, primary rental car insurance and extended warranty coverage. If you redeem your points for cash, you can receive your money in the form of an account statement credit or through an electronic deposit into an eligible US  checking or savings account.\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\nIntroduced in spring 2018, Business Unlimited rounds out Chase’s small business suite of cards. It mirrors the rewards structure and redemption options offered by its consumer card sibling, the Chase Freedom Unlimited. Like the consumer card, it too charges no annual fee. Read the full review.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nEarn $500 cash back after you spend $3,000 in the first three months after account opening. You can turn the bonus into 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points — and more than double your return — if you pair the Ink Business Unlimited with a card that earns UR points. According to TPG’s current valuations, 50,000 UR points are worth $1,050.\n\nEarning\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back per dollar spent on all purchases, which can be converted to 1.5 Ultimate Rewards points when paired with a UR card. You can boost this rate to an effective return of 3.15% (based on TPG’s valuations) on all spending if you move your points to another Chase card with Ultimate Rewards points.\n\nPerks\n\nThe card benefits on the Ink Business Unlimited are identical to those offered by Ink Business Cash, including purchase protection, primary rental car insurance and extended warranty coverage. If you redeem points for cash at 1 cent each, you can receive your money in the form of an account statement credit (which would reduce your card balance, but not your minimum monthly payment) or through an electronic deposit into an eligible US checking or savings account.\n\nRedeeming at the Travel Portal\n\nWhile all seven of these credit cards can redeem Ultimate Rewards points for statement credits or toward third-party gift cards at a flat rate of 1 cent per point, the options available through the premium cards offer far more value for travel redemptions in two separate ways.\n\nFirst, if you don’t want to worry about learning award charts and chasing award availability, you can redeem Ultimate Rewards points on any of the seven UR cards through the Chase travel portal. Depending on which Ultimate Rewards card or cards you have, you’ll get a different value for your points. Here’s how the redemptions break down:\n\nTravel Portal Value\n\nAccess to Transfer Partners?\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\n\n1.5 cents per point\n\nYes\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\n\n1.25 cents per point\n\nYes\n\nInk Business Preferred\n\n1.25 cents per point\n\nYes\n\nChase Freedom\n\n1 cent per point\n\nOnly when paired\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\n1 cent per point\n\nOnly when paired\n\nInk Business Cash\n\n1 cent per point \n\nOnly when paired\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\n1 cent per point\n\nOnly when paired\n\nUnsurprisingly, you’ll get the most value via the travel portal with Chase’s most premium card: the Chase Sapphire Reserve. But you’ll still get increased value with either of the other two Ultimate Rewards-enabled cards, and all three cards have the same ability to transfer points to Chase’s travel partners.\n\nTransferring to Partners\n\nThe second way of redeeming Ultimate Rewards for travel is through those 13 airline and hotel transfer partners. That’s where, with some time and effort, you can get the very best value, such as premium cabin redemptions to international destinations that normally cost thousands of dollars.\n\nOne of the best features of the transfer partners is that your points transfer to every one of them at an even 1:1 ratio — 1 point for 1 point — and in the majority of cases, your points will transfer instantly from Ultimate Rewards to the airline or hotel program.\n\nProgram\n\nTransfer Ratio\n\nTransfer Time\n\nAer Lingus\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nBritish Airways\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nFlying Blue (Air France/KLM)\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nHyatt\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nIberia\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nIHG\n\n1:1\n\n1 day\n\nKorean Air\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nMarriott\n\n1:1\n\n2 days\n\nRitz-Carlton\n\n1:1\n\n2 days\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\n1:1\n\nSame Day**\n\nSouthwest\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nUnited\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\n1:1\n\nInstantaneous\n\n** While points transferred from Ultimate Rewards to Singapore Airlines processed on the same day for us, the confirmation email from Chase states that it can take up to 2 business days for Ultimate Rewards transfers to appear in your Singapore KrisFlyer account.\n\nThere are literally dozens of ways to utilize these transfer partners to get maximum value for your Ultimate Rewards points. Here’s just a sampling:\n\nTransfer your points to British Airways and take advantage of round-trip transatlantic awards on Aer Lingus for 26,000 Avios on off-peak dates from Boston to Shannon or Dublin.\n\nTransfer 30,000 points to Hyatt and spend just $375 for three nights at the Park Hyatt Dubai, which normally would cost $1,580 with taxes and fees.\n\nTransfer 25,000 miles to the Air France/KLM Flying Blue program and book a one-way economy-class fare from Newark to Tel Aviv. That flight can get you a redemption rate of 7.4 cents per point.\n\nTransfer 45,000 miles to Korean Air’s SkyPass frequent flyer program and book a round-trip first-class award seat on non-alliance partner Delta for a redemption return of about 6.3 cents per point.\n\nBook a first-class flight on Korean Air using 80,000 points (typical fare is ~$5,000), which will get you more than 6 cents per point in value.\n\nTransfer 76,000 points to the Singapore KrisFlyer miles program to fly in Singapore Airlines’ luxurious Suites Class one way from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt. That redemption can be worth nearly 13 cents per point.\n\nTransfer 80,000 points to Korean Air to book a first-class flight that goes for nearly $5,000, getting you more than 6 cents per point.\n\nWith so many options, you’ll want to review some of our favorite tips and tricks on redeeming Ultimate Rewards points. We’ve listed a number of the very best ones in the “Further Reading” section below.\n\n5/24 and Household Rules\n\nYou may be considering applying for one or more of these cards to boost your bonus category rewards-earning potential or to fill in the gaps on your rewards for everyday spending. This is a smart idea, but make sure you mind Chase’s 5/24 rule, which bars you from gaining approval for another Chase card after you’ve opened five or more personal credit cards across all banks in the last 24 months. In other words, you can’t run out today and apply for all seven Chase UR-related cards and expect to get approved for them all.\n\nThe 5/24 rule applies to all seven of the cards listed above, including the business cards. However, if you’re approved for a Chase business card, it will not add to your 5/24 total — meaning you must be under 5/24 to be approved for an Ultimate Rewards business card, but you will still be at the same 5/24 total after approval.\n\nAlso, Chase allows you to transfer points to one other member of your household, so if either you or your spouse has one of the main three Ultimate Rewards cards, you can use that one card to maximize your points by running all your redemptions through it. However, be careful that you only transfer back and forth between you and that one other person, as in the past Chase has shut down accounts who were transferring Ultimate Rewards to multiple people or to folks outside their household.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNow that you’ve learned the basics of Chase Ultimate Rewards, you’ll find more advanced information in our multitude of guides on the subject. Here our some of our favorites:\n\nMaximize Your Wallet With the Perfect Quartet of Chase Cards\n\nThe Chase Ink Card Showdown: Cash vs. Preferred vs. Unlimited\n\n10 Tips for Using the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Center\n\nRedeeming Chase Ultimate Rewards for Maximum Value\n\nThe Best Business-Class Seats to Book Using Chase Ultimate Rewards Points\n\nTop 5 Ultimate Rewards Redemptions Achievable With One Sign-Up Bonus\n\nTPG Readers Reveal the Best Ways to Redeem Ultimate Rewards Points\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Chase lineup of Ultimate Rewards cards (and UR-adjacent cards) offers something for just about every type of rewards card user. Examine your spending patterns and apply for the mix of cards that will help you maximize earning welcome bonuses and rewards. For most people, that means focusing on the four consumer cards in the Chase portfolio, but if you’re a small business owner, you have seven different cards to think about. In any case, you’ll always want to consider cards that complement the types of spending you do in your work and business life.",

          "description": "Sorry, this deal is no longer available.  Do you want to be alerted about new deals as they’re published?  Click here to subscribe to Frequent Miler's Quick Deals.\n\nTalk about saving the best for last: if you still have the ability to get 20% via either of the 2 Amex Membership Rewards promotions, you can get a monster deal. I can’t take credit for this discovery — a reader commented on my post from late last night / early this morning, and it seemed good enough to share as all of the best Amazon deals can be maximized for a further discount by adding an Amazon gift card to make up the difference between the “original” price and $500, thereby netting a full $100 discount.\n\nAs an example, let’s look at the Apple version of the Bose noise-cancelling headphones that we posted last night. As you can see, the “original” price is $279 (the “price” under the list price):\n\nAs we noted last night, the 20% off that you can get by paying with 1 Amex Membership Rewards point (if you aren’t eligible for that promotion, see the section titled “Second 20% off promo” below) is taking 20% off of the original $279 and subtracting it from the sale price of $125.\n\n20% of $279 = $55.80\n$125 (sale price) – $55.80 = $69.20\n\nAnd that’s how it comes up in the cart:\n\nHowever, reader Larry figured out how to make this deal much hotter. Remember that the 20% off promo works on an order size up to $500 — you can get a max discount of $100. As Amazon is figuring the discount based on the “original” price of the headphones, Larry figured out that if you add an Amazon gift card worth the difference between the original price and $500, you’ll get a total discount of $100.\n\nIn other words, $500 (max order for discount) – $279 (original price of headphones) = $221. If you add a $221 Amazon gift card to your card, you’ll get a total of $100 off. Start off by adding the headphones (Apple version) to your cart plus a $221 Amazon gift card.\n\nThis is what your cart will look like.\n\nWhen you go to checkout and apply at least 1 Membership Rewards point either using the original promotion or the new promotion (more below), this is what your total will look like:\n\nThat’s a total of $247.99. For $247.99, you get:\n\nA $221 Amazon gift card\n\nthe Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones\n\nAnd if you stack with the Quick Deal that Stephen posted earlier (See: New Amazon Amex Offer: Earn 3x Membership Rewards), you’ll also earn 744 Membership Rewards points. Now that’s a steal. If you were to value the Amazon Gift Card at face value, that would mean a net cost of $27 for the headphones. An Amazon gift card isn’t the same as cash that can be spent anywhere, but if you’re an Amazon Prime member, I’m sure it’s pretty close in value to you.\n\nThat same technique works on tons of other items. Here is the Sonos One with a total of $301 in gift cards ($50 as part of the bundle + $251 added to hit the $500 mark) for $353.91.\n\nThat speaker alone normally sells for $199. Getting that plus $301 in gift cards for $353 is an awesome deal.\n\nThis works for tons of the other good deals we’ve posted. As a reminder, here are some of them. Do the math on adding a gift card to the “original prices” crossed out below to hit $500 and trigger the full $100 discount. Some of them become really awesome — though note that some may no longer be available.\n\nOculus Rift + Touch Virtual Reality System: Original price $399 Prime Day sale price: $349 Final price: $269.20\n\nRobot Roomba 671 Robot Vacuum With Wi-Fi: Original price $349.99 Prime Day sale price: $229.99 Final price: $159.99 with inflated 20% off (We have another 600-series model.

This one requires you to pay with at least 1 Membership Rewards point and add coupon code AMEXSWP20PD. Word is that this deal may work for people who maxed out the previous 20% off promo and/or may work for those who weren’t targeted for that one. There’s no guarantee — but it’s worth a shot.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you are still eligible for either of these promotions and you value Amazon gift cards anywhere near cash, adding a gift card to hit the max discount looks like the best deal yet.

          "description": "The new dream job is none at all. A contingent of ambitious upper-middle-class types are devoting themselves single-mindedly to achieving early retirement, with the goal of liberating themselves from work to later travel the world or pursue a creative passion.\n\nPerhaps the contemporary quest for future unemployment stems from the fact that many jobs seem meaningless and unfulfilling. According to anthropologist David Graeber, author of the recently published book Bullshit Jobs, much work today features a lot of unnecessary busywork. Society didn’t consciously design work this way, Graeber argues, but it’s preventing people from making a “meaningful contribution to the world.” In his 2013 essay, “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs,” Graeber explains:\n\nHuge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.\n\nSo let’s talk about it. Is your job bullshit? I’d argue that it’s not—no matter what you do. The scar across our collective soul comes not from the work itself, but from our perceptions of meaninglessness.\n\nAny job is better than none\n\nI say this as someone who’s had lots of jobs. Some were so meaningful, in fact, that I quit after a few years because the weight of working to solve serious problems became unbearable. Here is a partial list of the positions I’ve held: maid, hotel receptionist, waitress, store clerk, line cook, barista, personal assistant, English teacher, writer of all kinds, lawyer of many stripes, language interpreter, translator, studio manager, and bookkeeper.\n\nHaving done all this stuff, and been unemployed on several occasions, I can safely say that the only thing worse than working is not having a job. That’s a bit of wisdom my friend Kalim Shabazz shared with me when I was 28, in New York, complaining about needing meaningful work. At the time, Shabazz was a master’s student in psychology at Fordham University and a DJ, and I was writing at ABCNews.com. I should have been pretty pleased, but I wanted to do something “real.” Reporting seemed to be merely describing the work of others.\n\nSo I joined the Peace Corps, where I had plenty of time to ponder meaning in a remote Senegalese village of 43 people, 30 of whom were small children. There, I discovered that Shabazz was right. In the village, my role was amorphous. I was supposed to help people with agroforestry and health projects, but the efforts often went awry. It’s fair to say that most of the time the villagers helped me more than I did them.\n\nWhen I returned to the US, my notions about work were completely transformed. Although I’ve had many jobs since, and feelings about them all, I’ve done each with utter conviction for a time. My friend’s wise words stayed with me.\n\nSolving puzzles\n\nIt’s not the job itself that gives us a sense of purpose, but the pleasure of work. Yes, that’s right. Pleasure. Because work at its best—whether it’s pouring coffee or defending the indigent accused in a county jail—is a kind of play. In the moment of doing, meaning doesn’t matter, just the task. That’s a relief from spending time dwelling on the big picture: who you’re meant to be and what you should try to achieve in your life.\n\nWhen we’re working, we’re doing what’s needed, which in some jobs, some of the time—like clerking at any empty hotel—is just being there. When we perform our task well, we’re successful in ways big and small. That feels momentarily great. Your work may not change the world. But your approach to it makes a meaningful difference in how you and those your work with, and serve, feel.\n\nThe pleasure of work “lies partly in flow, in the process of losing oneself in a puzzle with a solution on which other people depend,” Ryan Avant argues in The Economist’s 1843. He believes work is fun, and likens professionals to “master craftsmen of the age” creating “bespoke” products.\n\nHowever, Avant’s view is limited. He believes that “middling wage service workers” don’t have access to the same kind of pleasure. He takes a position similar to that of 19th century philosopher Karl Marx—being occupied by “good work” is living well, and purposeful occupation enables people to realize their full potential.\n\nIt would be fantastic if we all found our best and highest use on the job. But dismissing all service work misses an important point. The puzzle we’re all constantly solving is survival, ideally with minimal friction and conflict and the maximum positive exchanges. When a supermarket bagger makes the effort to pack your shopping in a way that ensures the eggs don’t break, or offers to carry your stuff, that’s a plus. It doesn’t change the course of humanity, but it sure is nice—and ought to make you appreciative of the person doing the job. The bagger, with every customer, solves the puzzle of packing and earning a wage, hopefully making their portion of the world run smoothly.\n\nWhat’s more, it’s impressive when anyone does anything with verve. Just ask Michael Gates Gill, author of the 2008 riches-to-rags tale How Working at Starbucks Saved My Life. There’s dignity in doing whatever must be done, according to the former advertising executive. Gill, who became a barista in his fifties, says his younger coffeeshop boss taught him an appreciation for occupation. She offered him a job interview when he was unemployed, depressed, and buying a latte as consolation—not planning to ask for work. He was shocked to discover he was incredibly grateful for the opportunity, and envious of the young woman’s confidence and pride in her position. He clinched the interview by describing how he’d handle customers in tough situations—in other words, proving that he was up to solving the puzzles that service work presents.\n\nPerhaps, as Avant himself points out in his essay, he’s overly-identifying with his great writing job. For him, work is a delightful “prison” he doesn’t wish to escape. But work isn’t exclusively satisfying when you’re paid a lot and can feel a bit smug about your wonderful position.\n\nDifficult, thankless, low-paid work may be undervalued societally, but it’s critical to everyone. And every job has some possibilities, not recognized by snobs. When I worked as a maid at Israel’s only ski resort in the Golan Heights, it wasn’t fun scrubbing toilets. But it was an interesting location and soon enough, my manufactured zeal for cleaning led to a job at the front desk, where I spent a lot of time talking to local Druze workers who I never would have met otherwise.\n\nIn a similar vein, Gill’s boss at Starbucks, who grew up poor, went from barista to store manager, and she was proud of her position. She was able to help a seemingly privileged man in a fancy suit get his bearings again when he was sick and broke, although neither of them would have imagined she’d ever be able to help someone like him.\n\nNo exit\n\nJohn Danaher argues in The Philosopher’s Magazine that all this talk of jobs and purpose is precisely the problem with postmodern society. In his recent essay, “The Case Against Work,” Danaher, a law lecturer at the National University of Ireland in Galway, contends that—love it or hate it—we’re all obsessed with work. People either humblebrag about their busyness, or they “virtue signal” defiance of the societal preoccupation with labor by boasting about work-life balance. “I think we have got caught up in game that deadens our spirits and limits our horizons. We need to escape,” he writes.\n\nThere’s that word again—escape. Instead of playing this necessary game with spirit, Danaher argues that we should understand work as “bad.” He—like Avant and Graeber—believes that only a few workers have it good, and so on behalf of all those who don’t have the supreme fortune to be academics, journalists, or “master craftsmen,” everyone should consider work problematic.\n\nDanaher defines work as “the performance of an activity for economic reward or in the hope of receiving some such reward.” He believes that work is bad because many employment contracts allow employers to undermine worker freedom. But because jobs are increasingly precarious, workers accept this awkward position, as we need to make a living. Then, our brains are “colonized” by work, Danaher contends, contemplating employment even when we aren’t paid to labor.\n\nBut as anyone who has been under- or unemployed knows—which is many of us, thanks to the very vagaries of employment Danaher discusses—much worse than work is worry about its absence. Struggling to figure out how to pay for food and shelter, wondering when or if you’ll work again, and trying to avoid spending money leaves little mental space for creativity and is more tedious than bitching about office politics or a boring gig.\n\nFor most of us, work is necessary. Treating our working years like a kind of purgatory and dreaming of early retirement is perhaps fine if you’re a magical being with a guarantee that you’ll live a long time. But you probably aren’t, so you’re better off learning to live, work, and play now.\n\nThe answer isn’t escape from a “voluntary prison,” but a new way of thinking about how we spend our working days and breaks—making today matter, both on the job and during time off. The quality of our lives depends, in part, on our perception of existence. Or, as William Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet when the Danish prince called his land a prison, “There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.”\n\nThat’s not to say that all jobs are so great that you should stay in them forever. You probably couldn’t even if you wanted to. Change is the only constant on the postmodern career path, and job security is a thing of the past.\n\nBut working isn’t inherently bad. It’s labor that makes free time so great, for example, and—if it’s lucrative, or if you’re frugal—what allows you to pursue travels and passions.\n\nThe gift of contrast\n\nContrast—as the Tao Te Ching teaches—is key. “Clay is made into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness that use depends. The door and windows are cut out to form a house; but it is on empty space, that its use depends. Everything is shaped by nothing,” according to the Taoist sage Lao Tzu. Labor gives leisure time flavor—it is because you hustle on the job that days off doing nothing but reading or hanging with friends are fun.\n\nMoreover, whatever your job, it has some satisfying aspects, even if only because it lets you pay your way. That is nothing to scoff at—in a capitalist society, people who prize freedom can surely be pleased when they don’t need the assistance of a government reluctant to give.\n\nMore than that, you have a vested interest in finding ways to appreciate even the most boring work. Perhaps with time, you will find a perfect way to spend your days. But for now, dwelling perpetually in dissatisfaction will only compound unhappiness and make you less likely to find your way.\n\nWe shouldn’t, in the words of transcendentalist writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, “shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.” His classic 1841 essay “Self-Reliance” scoffs at those who need to immediately and obviously succeed or be special. Instead, he exalts the “sturdy,” someone “who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles…in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet.” That admirable person, “does not postpone his life, but lives already,” according to Emerson.\n\nDisrespect for your own work can lead you to disrespect the work of others, too.  If you can only admire the few powerful people who make it big, you’re dissing almost everyone and missing out on humanity’s dignity.\n\nBeing adaptive is a critical life skill that’s practiced at work, whatever job. Understanding this, you can take an interest in pretty much anything for some time and, as a result, become more interesting and accumulate experiences that will inform your next steps. As Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck points out, interests aren’t inherently fixed. Having a growth mindset, being open, is wiser than pinning your hopes on a single passion; it makes you more resilient, creative, intelligent, and happy.\n\nEven if you’re not naturally passionate about serving cranky customers, for example, or reading corporate law documents, you can discover that these puzzles, too, present fascinating discoveries and solutions. Service work is a kind of diplomacy training ground that helps you in office jobs and beyond. Doing temporary legal document review projects in New York—considered by many to be the saddest drudgery of lawyering—ended up leading me to a job at Google headquarters in California. There I got to read the privileged mail of some of the world’s most powerful technologists, among other delicious private business records. Not only was it fascinating, it taught me all about the brave new world we live in.\n\nCultivating appreciation for the mundane is also good preparation for the dreamed-of moment of freedom. Assuming you can someday retire, you’ll need to be practiced at the fine art of keeping yourself busy and fulfilled. Your empty days may be very painful if you can’t manage to appreciate small pleasures.\n\nIt is what it is\n\nThe point of your work doesn’t have to be earth-shattering or dramatic. It just has to matter to you because you’re doing it, and some things must be done.\n\nAs the eighth-century Chinese Zen master Chao Chou told a monk who sought philosophical secrets, “Wash your bowl.” The exchange is sometimes thought to explain the spiritual significance of simple tasks, but it’s not that complex.\n\n“To attribute meaning to an event or to a lifetime of events is an expression of dissatisfaction with things as they are,” writes author and Chico State University Buddhist ethics professor Lin Jensen. What Zen teaches, by contrast,  is that reality is sufficient. “We’re not here to represent something else. We’re here in our own right. A human being, or a garden hoe for that matter, is complete in itself,” writes Jensen. He believes Chao Chou is showing the monk that everything he seeks to know or be is already present in him.\n\nWork is a game, like Danaher says. So treat it like grown-up play, not something to escape. It can be fun, but it doesn’t have to be so important or representative of anything. That’s okay too.\n\nGiven the precariousness of employment today, you may find yourself needing to do something new soon enough anyway. Then, when the robots take over the job you don’t hate, you’ll be flexible enough to figure out your next steps and do whatever else must be done with admirable aplomb.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "The Manager's Perspective\n\nNed Yost\n\nBob Melvin\n\nBrian Snitker\n\nRon Gardenhire\n\nBuck Showalter\n\nTorey Lovullo\n\nRick Renteria\n\nIn many respects, Rick Renteria wears multiple hats as manager of the Chicago White Sox. The AL Central team he’s leading is in full-rebuild mode, its roster populated with a plethora of inexperienced players. That makes him a good fit for the position. As Cubs skipper Joe Maddon opined at the outset of spring training, “There are managers, and there are managers who are also good coaches. Not everybody can do both. [Renteria] can coach it, and he can manage it.”\n\nThe 56-year-old former big-league infielder has 20 years of both under his belt, the majority — but not all — in the minor leagues. He was at the helm for Chicago’s NL entry in 2014 — Maddon replaced him the following year — before moving across town in 2016 to serve as Robin Ventura’s bench coach. Last season, he took over as manager, where his job is less about winning now than it is to mold young players into winners. That requires patience and an ability to instruct, and along with good leadership skills, Renteria possesses each of those attributes.\n\n———\n\nRick Renteria: “Coming up through the system… every organization is different in terms of their philosophy, yet they’re all the same. We all want a player to understand, fundamentally, how to go about playing the game — how to run the bases, how to have an approach at the plate, how to defend, when to throw to what base. Things of that nature.\n\n“Until you get here, though… you can be very well taught, but there’s a different dynamic in the big leagues, and it involves emotion and your mindset. No matter how well prepared, you’re going to make a mistake or two. Of course, that could be said for guys who have been in the big leagues for years.\n\n“When you get here from the minor leagues, you continue to understand, and get a feel for, who you are as a player — what you’re supposed to be and what you can and cannot do. That comes through experience. And again, a lot of it has to do with emotions and your mindset. The emotions can speed the game up for you and take you out of your normal element.\n\n“As a player, you have to establish that you actually belong. We all believe that we should be here, but there’s a deeper trust factor in truly knowing that you belong in the big leagues and then running with it.\n\n“There is also so much information at the major-league level right now. You know what other clubs want to do. You know how they want to defend. You know what tacks they take. For instance, their catchers like back-picking or their outfielders like throwing behind a runner if they see somebody taking a hard, wide turn. If they have a good arm, they might have a chance to back-door you. You have to know who can do that, and you also have to know who you can take advantage of. There’s another level of understanding of what you can do against players at the major-league level.\n\n“When you’re getting players here younger and younger, they just don’t have as many experiences behind them. There might be a particular situation they’ve never dealt with before and it throws them into a little bit of a quandary. Well, once they’ve experienced it, you talk it through, they understand it, and there’s a good chance that the next time it arises they’ll be better prepared to deal with it.\n\n“We have conversations every day. Before the games, after the games. If there are things we have to touch upon, we go to the video we have available to us. Sometimes we have to go back to it to make sure we’re clear on what we saw with the naked eye. We can watch a video and get a feel for what they were thinking when they were doing what they were doing, where there might have been a failed action. I’ll give you an example.\n\n“We had a play, a ground-ball chopper to Yoan Moncada, the other day in which he started charging the ball. It was against Milwaukee. Christian Yelich was running from first to second. The ball was bringing him forward and he probably could have either tagged Yelich or run him back and thrown to first to get the out, and then have Yelich in a rundown for a double play. He ended up reverse spinning and throwing to second. We got the out at second, but weren’t able to turn a double play.\n\n“In his mind’s eye he didn’t think he had a chance to tag and/or get him in a rundown. When you go back and look at the video, you validate what happened. Joey [Cora] brought him in, looked at it, talked to him about it. It’s just one play, but it’s a play that’s important because it can get you out of an inning. Joey showed him the video. He got a view that showed him he could have continued to move forward and initiate a particular play.\n\n“We go back with video all the time. What were they doing when they fail to execute a particular action? What caused it? We look at it beyond what we saw in the moment, because we might get more clarity if we slow it down. We bring the player in and ask him what he was thinking, because there’s always a thought process to it.\n\n“There are also our [veteran players]. I think a lot of [veteran leadership] is allowing guys to get more and more comfortable in their own skin, and having someone — one senior player, I’d say — holding them accountable. That’s whether it’s done loudly or quietly. Is that important? Absolutely.\n\n“Pito Abreu is a huge influence on a lot of these guys. From the pitching standpoint, we have James Shields, who is a big influence on a lot of these guys. Would you like to have more [veteran leaders]? Well, that’s not where we’re at right now. But we do have two or three, and as managers and coaches, we also have to be a part of that influence. Until it all comes together, we also have to be the ones who hold a particular bar for them and have them meet that expectation.\n\n“Which players have I influenced the most? Let me reverse that question and say they’ve influenced me more than I’ve influenced them. I tell players that I wish for them to make it. This is my motto: I wish for them to make it, not because of me, but to make it in spite of me. That’s my motto.”\n",

And so in this city of staggering wealth, you can eat like a gourmand, with real stemware and ceramic plates. But first you’ll have to go get your own silverware.\n\n…Restaurateurs here have taken a model familiar to taquerias and fast-casual, cafeteria-style places like Sweetgreen and Chipotle Mexican Grill, and pushed it further up the fine-dining food chain. Call it fast-fine, they suggest, or fine-casual. Or counter service “in a full service environment” that includes $11 cocktails and $22 pan-roasted salmon.\n\nBy the way, rent is not the only problem:\n\nOn July 1, the minimum wage in San Francisco will hit $15 an hour, following incremental raises from $10.74 in 2014. The city also requires employers with at least 20 workers to pay health care costs beyond the mandates of the Affordable Care Act, in addition to paid sick leave and parental leave.\n\nEven the dosa is troubled:\n\nIn December, he opened a counter-service version of Dosa in Oakland. The new restaurant serves cardamom- and fenugreek-spiced cocktails. But there’s also a self-service water station, and a busing station for diners inclined to clear their own tables.

          "description": "One of the great things about the Internet is that it’s broken down many of the barriers to information that existed in the past. Investors can now become more informed than ever before if they know where to look and who to trust. You no longer have to go through the gatekeepers to access relevant financial market information.\n\nThis has leveled the playing field for the individual investor. With an abundance of information available, the winners and losers will be determined by those who are able to better process, filter and analyze the firehose of information that’s being put out there these days.\n\nI spend a lot of time looking at historical market data and am always trying to figure out more efficient ways of doing so. While it can’t help me predict the future, it can help me analyze the present and assess probabilities from the past. Historical data does a better job predicting risk than returns but that’s about the best you can do in the absence of a functioning crystal ball. I prize evidence over opinions so I use a lot of back-tested data in my work.\n\nI get a lot of questions from readers asking what data sources or models I use. I’ve been building my own excel models and formulas for a while and have access to a handful of professional subscription-based offerings. But you don’t have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on historical data providers to access useful financial data in the Internet age. There are plenty of really useful free websites out there that have historical market data, back-testing tools, risk statistics and scenario analysis capabilities.\n\nHere are a number of them that I have found helpful over the years:\n\nNYU’s stock, bond & cash historical returns\nNYU professor Aswath Damodaran uses this site to update the performance numbers for stocks (S&P 500), bonds (10-year treasuries) and cash (3-month t-bills) once a year. It shows the annual returns for these three asset classes going all the way back to 1928. You can also download an excel file that contains historical interest rates, bond yields, and dividend yields. I use these numbers frequently.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\nThis site has one of the best free asset allocation back-testing programs I’ve come across. There are probably 20-30 different asset classes and sub-asset classes you can back-test to the 1970s with historical returns, drawdowns, real (after-inflation) returns, and growth of your initial investment. This site also allows you to perform Monte Carlo simulations on withdrawal strategies, correlation matrixes between different assets, risk factor analysis and back-test real world portfolios using actual mutual funds and ETFs. That this website is available for free is pretty remarkable.\n\nRobert Shiller’s online data\nShiller has one of the longest running data sets I’ve seen. His famous CAPE spreadsheet has the monthly stock price, interest rate, earnings and dividend data going back to 1871. This site also has his comprehensive real estate data on home prices going back well over 100 years.\n\nTwitter\nPeople on social media love to complain about social media but I find a ton of value in the information I receive from Twitter. I’m constantly finding helpful research, graphs, data and analysis that I wouldn’t be exposed to otherwise. Twitter is my go-to source for what’s going on in the world of finance and the markets along with under-the-radar research.\n\nFama-French\nKen French updates this site using much of the research he’s done over the years with Eugene Fama. This one is a factor investing nerd’s dream, although the site does take some time to figure out how to use efficiently (at least in my experience). French updates his data regularly with historical returns on factors such as small-cap stocks, value stocks, quality stocks and momentum stocks going back to the 1920s. This site also has great data on sector and industry historical returns. All of the data is easily exportable to excel.\n\nCredit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook\nResearchers Elroy Dimson, Paul March, and Mike Staunton update this report once a year with numbers on stocks, bonds, and inflation going back to 1900 for a number of different countries. It’s worth it to go through the entire report at least once.\n\nMSCI\nMSCI provides the most comprehensive free source of historical market data on foreign stock markets. They have performance numbers going back to 1970 for different countries, regions, and markets, both developed and emerging.\n\nAbnormal Returns\nThe best curated content each and every day on investing, personal finance, research and anything else in the world of finance. If you miss anything worth reading you can be sure it will be here.\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)\nEcon geeks love this site because the Federal Reserve has data on almost anything related to economics you can think of. There’s also plenty of good market data on stocks, bonds, and interest rates as well. And the site allows you to personalize the graphs and datasets.\n\nMorningstar\nI find that Morningstar has the best data on mutual funds and ETFs for performance purposes. You can see annual returns going back 10 years, and monthly and quarterly returns going back 5 years. They provide after-tax returns and fund behavior gaps, which I find really useful for seeing what investors are actually earning in these funds. You can also find breakdowns of fund holdings, investment styles, geographic allocations and more.\n\nYahoo! Finance\nI like Yahoo! Finance for daily historical data on stocks, interest rates, and indexes. They also have annual and quarterly performance numbers for mutual funds going back to inception, many of which give you decades of returns.\n\nPortfolio Charts\nThis is another great asset allocation back-testing tool that allows you to see how a number of different well-known portfolios have performed over the years. This site has the best visuals of any I’ve played around with. You can also stress-test a large number of asset classes and strategies.\n\nAnd here are a few more I’ve used over the years:\n\nFeel free to shoot me an email if there are any that I’ve missed and I’ll be sure to add them to this list.\n\nFurther Reading:\nOn the Merits of Being a Financial Historian\n\nUpdate: Here are the many suggestions I received from my readers for some of their favorites:\n\nThis post originally appeared on March 17, 2017.\n\n \n\n\r\n",

          "description": "It sounds like hyperbole, but it isn’t: Half of American women struggle to find jeans that fit at the mall. More specifically, only 13% of women’s jeans in brick and mortar stores are available for women of average size or larger.\n\nThe number comes from a Quartz analysis of women’s denim offerings in the Mall of America that bluntly illustrates the reality faced by millions of women in the fitting room. We looked at every store selling women’s apparel in one of America’s largest malls and compared the jean waist sizes on offer to the typical American woman’s waist size. We excluded department stores.\n\nThe median waist size for American women aged 20 years and older is 37.3 inches (94.8 cm), while the average is 38 inches. Most popular retailers don’t produce jeans at either size. It’s 8 inches larger than the median waist size of jeans available at the Mall of America—30 inches. It is only one inch smaller than the median of the largest sizes carried by these brands.\n\nData are based on sizing charts found on each retailer’s website. When sizes were indicated by a range, we used the average. H&M was excluded because it is currently in the process of changing its sizing.\n\nWhile every retailer that sells womens’ denim offers sizes for customers with a waist smaller than the average, only half provide at least one option for women with a larger waist. The stores with larger sizes often further relegate them to website-only collections.\n\nRetailers use a series of euphemisms to tell shoppers larger than their offerings not to bother coming to the mall. “Only at oldnavy.com,” “in stock online,” and perhaps the most devious “online exclusive!” are all different ways of telling customers, “don’t come to our store, we don’t serve your size.”\n\nBlue jeans may be a universal icon of US culture; however, this wearable symbol of capitalism, freedom, and James Dean is only easily accessible to half of American women despite the business opportunity. Fashion designer Christian Siriano recently said he tripled his business by adding more inclusive sizing. But faced with limited options for denim, (and of course changing preferences) women have turned to other products. For the first time ever the US has imported more yoga pants than blue jeans.\n",

          "description": "The frantic phone calls to the Community Water Center began in the summer of 2014. In the 7,000-strong unincorporated community of East Porterville, nestled against California's Sierra Nevada mountains, homeowners' wells were failing amid a historic drought. Folks were hauling water from their workplaces or from agricultural wells. Parents were sending their kids to shower at the local high school. Residents with still-functional wells were snaking hoses over fences to nourish their neighbors.\n\n\"People were in dire straights. They were desperate,\" says Ryan Jensen of the Central Valley's Community Water Center. \"Elderly people or people battling chronic illnesses that need water to be able to deal with their health issues had no access to it. There was just absolute desperation.\"\n\nIn total, the wells at 300 properties had failed. So a local nonprofit distributed 275-gallon tanks and officials trucked in water. That didn't cut it.\n\nOn account of being unincorporated, East Porterville only had a handful of buildings connected to the water system in Porterville proper. So beginning in August 2016, workers hurried to connect 750 homes, the last of which tapped into Porterville this past February.\n\nLA's sprawling Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant processes the wastewater of 4.5 million people.\n\nwired\n\nEast Porterville's situation is extreme, but it is not an outlier. If anything, it is a harbinger. \"It was only an outlier in the concentration and sheer number of people who lived in a very small area that were affected by this,\" Jensen says. \"There's approximately 300 communities in the state of California and more than a million residents who don't have reliable access to safe drinking water, and that's not even counting people who are on domestic wells.\"\n\nCalifornia is in trouble. Computer models show that with climate change will come harsher droughts and less frequent, yet more powerful storms. The state is not ready for this new reality, but one city south of Porterville could teach California how to survive desiccation: Los Angeles.\n\nThat is not a typo. Agreed, Los Angeles doesn't exactly have a sterling reputation as a responsible consumer of water. After all, in the early 1900s it drained Owens Lake, 200 miles away, materializing a dust bowl in its place and giving local residents the old ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.  These days, it imports the vast majority of its water from Northern California and the Colorado River to the east at a cost of hundreds of millions a year.\n\nBut Los Angeles is in the midst of an aqueous awakening, setting an ambitious goal to cut its reliance on imported water in half by 2025 by following an increasingly urgent rule of good water policy: diversification. In a nutshell, that means getting your water from a range of sources—rain capture, aquifers, wells, desalination, even right out of the air. A study from UCLA earlier this year even said the city could feasibly reach 100 percent locally sourced water. To do it, the city is diving into a series of high- and low-tech campaigns that could transform Los Angeles into a model city for water management.\n\nAgain, not a typo.\n\nWater Begins With Dirt\n\nArt Castro of the LA Department of Water and Power stands atop his city's future: the San Fernando aquifer, which sprawls for 175 square miles. It is, essentially, a giant underground water tank that can provide some 28 billion gallons of water. (Usage fluctuates from month to month and year to year, but in July 2017, Angelenos consumed 102 gallons a day per capita.) Behind Castro, tractors push massive amounts of dirt. Dirt to the left, dirt to the right. In fact, this place is nothing but dirt, which is weird considering it's just 25 miles north of downtown LA. This should be concrete. Maybe a condo complex or two.\n\nConcrete, though, is the enemy of Los Angeles' future. Back when the city sprouted, designers laid it out to channel stormwater away as quickly as possible. City Planning 101. SoCal's notorious downpours and flash floods were a menace. There were properties and human lives to consider, after all. \"Now there's been there's been a shift in that thinking,\" Castro says. \"Now we see stormwater as an asset.\"\n\nAt the Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility, engineers turn wastewater into something so pure, it'd do terrible things to your body if they didn't add minerals back in.\n\nWired\n\nThe answer is this rare empty plot of land, the 150-acre Tujunga Spreading Grounds, laid out in 1930 and preserved as open space to this day. Stormwater flows in, gathering in giant basins and slowly percolating into the dirt and, eventually, the aquifer. When these crews are done excavating 1.9 million cubic yards of soil to consolidate 19 basins into 9 deeper basins (fewer berms = more surface area for soakage), enough water will be captured each year to hydrate an average of 50,000 households.\n\nSure, the LADWP serves more than 4 million customers, so it's but a drip. But the Tujunga Spreading Grounds are just the start. A mile and a half away in a frenetic LA street is a beautified median—some nice little trees, shrubs, and dirt, with a walking path meandering through—that doubles as a spreading ground in miniature. Stormwater from the neighborhood flows here and soaks into the ground, instead of flowing to the sea.\n\nIt may only collect enough for 150 households, but that ain't bad for a single median. And the thing about medians is, LA has a few of them: The city can duplicate this project wherever the soils are permeable enough to accept water. A storm that dumps 1 inch of rain will deposit over 8 billion gallons of water on Los Angeles. (The LADWP supplies about 160 billion gallons a year.) Of course, you're not going to collect all the stormwater that falls on Los Angeles, but catchment projects like the Tujunga spreading grounds and green medians can grab a fraction that would otherwise drain to the sea.\n\nAnd grab the city must. Climate change will not be kind to Southern California. \"More droughts, more floods, and more warm temperatures all will result in more water when we don't want it, and less water when we do,\" says Michael Kiparsky, director of the Wheeler Water Institute at UC Berkeley.\n\nWhich means that when Los Angeles gets those rare deluges, it needs to somehow get that water into that aquifer, where it can be drawn on in times of want. \"We understand that we're sitting on a gold mine,\" Castro says.\n\nWater, Water, Everywhere\n\nNot every city is so geologically fortunate, though. A hundred miles south of Los Angeles is the coastal city of Carlsbad, near San Diego. Just off the beach, up a well-manicured hill, sits a nondescript building—not the kind of place you'd think would suck in 100 million gallons of seawater and turn it into 50 million gallons of fresh drinking water every day.\n\nBut step inside the Carlsbad Desalination Plant and the scale becomes clear: row after row of stacked tubes loaded with membranes poked full of minuscule holes. Pump saltwater through these at a staggering 900 pounds per square inch (for reference, the air in your car tire is around 30 psi) and you can filter out viruses, bacteria, and, of course, salt. This is known as reverse osmosis.\n\nUnlike Los Angeles, San Diego isn't sitting on an aquifer goldmine, says Jessica Jones, director of communications for Poseidon Water, which operates the plant. \"So we have very few local supplies. Having such a high dependence on imported supplies makes a project like this perfect for this county, because we'll always need it.\"\n\nFor this county being the operative phrase. Desalination has been around for decades, yet hasn't really taken off—for good reason. Pumping millions of gallons of water at 900 psi isn't exactly energy efficient, though that's changing with new technologies. At this plant, they use exchangers that recycle pressure that would otherwise be lost, and they claim it has reduced the energy consumption of the reverse osmosis process by half.\n\nThe Carlsbad Desalination Plant sucks in 100 million gallons of seawater and turns it into 50 million gallons of fresh drinking water every day.\n\nWired\n\nSan Diego knows full well it has a water diversity problem. Almost all its water comes from Northern California and the Colorado River. Problem is, eight other states get a taste of the Colorado before California. \"We're at the end of a very long straw,\" Jones says.\n\nDesalination is still expensive, yes. But for San Diego, it could well be a critical fallback if, say, an earthquake cuts off the supply of imported water. That said, desalination ain't for everyone. Where plenty of rain falls, there's not much of a case for spending money to tap into the sea.\n\nStill, relying on a single source of water is extremely perilous. \"Diversification is important for water management in the same way that it's important for your financial portfolio,\" says Kiparsky, of the Wheeler Water Institute.\n\nIf you bet all your money on one company and that company craters, you're broke. Spread your money around, though, and you can ride out the rough times. Same goes for water: Los Angeles is betting big on catchment, and San Diego diversified its portfolio with desalination. At no small expense, sure, but in the end San Diego has better prepared itself for an uncertain future.\n\nBack up in Los Angeles, they're taking another, more … contentious step to prepare themselves for that uncertainty: recycled toilet water.\n\nWaste Not, Want Not\n\nFor a facility that processes the wastewater of 4.5 million people, the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant doesn't smell nearly as bad as you'd expect. Until, that is, you start making your way to the headworks, where giant mechanized rakes scoop out inorganic material—cloth and such. The stench is eye-wateringly spectacular.\n\nAfter scooping, Hyperion further refines most of the water until it's safe to pump 5 miles out to sea. Around 40 million gallons a day, however, flow down the road to the Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility, where a complex filtering system turns the fairly-clean-but-nowhere-near-drinkable stuff into water so pure, it'll make you very, very sick if you drink enough of it. (More on that in a moment.)\n\nThat level of purity is the result of the very same process that turns seawater fresh down in Carlsbad: reverse osmosis. The water is pumped through membranes, which sort out nasties like viruses and the many pharmaceuticals that come out with urine. It's even blasted with UV light to make sure nothing biological gets through. The end product is very nearly pure hydrogen and oxygen, which would actually end up leaching minerals out of pipes, not to mention the human body. \"If you were to drink enough of that water, it could pull calcium from your bones,\" says Christiana Daisy, operations manager at West Basin Municipal Water District, which runs the facility. So they actually have to add minerals back in.\n\nFor now, the purified water doesn't go into customers' taps. Instead, it's injected into the ground to act as a kind of barrier between seawater and fresh groundwater. But the idea is to one day recycle wastewater and put it right back into the system. The industry is moving cautiously, though, given what you might call a considerable \"ick\" factor for the public. But hell, if  Texas can go toilet to tap, why can't California?\n\nHere's the thing, though: You've been drinking recycled wastewater this whole time. \"Somebody upstream of you is using the water, treating it, and then discharging it back,\" says USC engineer Amy Childress, who specializes in the membranes that make desalination and wastewater treatment possible. \"And then that water is treated again and used as drinking water.\"\n\nSalt water under pressure passes through membranes, purifying it for drinking.\n\nWired\n\nAre reverse osmosis processes like desalination and wastewater treatment still expensive? Sure. But they rely on technology, and technology generally improves. Membranes will get more efficient, and prices will fall. That'll help more communities diversify their water portfolios.\n\nWhich is an immediate, not future, concern. \"Fresh\" water isn't always as fresh as you're expecting it to be. \"There are a lot of places in the US that people wouldn't think have issues with water supply—the East Coast for example,\" Childress says. \"In places where we weren't considering desalination in the past, even if it's just brackish groundwater, we're now maybe needing to desalinate.\" This could grow increasingly relevant as rising seas begin to infiltrate supplies of fresh groundwater.\n\nBut maybe pulling water from the ground isn't the only way to go about this—perhaps you can pull it from the air too. Nets in Chile, for instance, collect fog as drinking water, though the efficiency is only 2 percent, max. But MIT researchers recently developed a system that ionizes fog droplets, making them attracted to mesh, thus raising the efficiency to 99 percent. And over at UC Berkeley, engineers have concocted a fancy sponge-like material that collects moisture from cool desert air at night and releases it as drinking water when things heat up during the day.\n\nAll well and good, but technology will only get us so far. We can't just engineer our way out of this one. \"It's got to be a conservation mind-set,\" Childress says. \"We have to start valuing water more.\"\n\nLessons From the State of Plenty\n\nThis is bigger than Los Angeles. This is about fundamentally changing humanity's perverse relationship with water.\n\nYou don't appreciate water, because no one in the developed world really does, save for the residents of East Porterville, which very nearly withered and fell from the vine that is bountiful California. \"Ultimately, if things were to get far worse, I think we could see this happening in bigger cities,\" says Jensen of the Community Water Center. \"But I think the bigger, more likely problem is that wide swaths of rural California may have to pack up and move.\"\n\nNot everyone is as lucky as Los Angeles, with its piles of money and sprawling aquifer, or San Diego, with its piles of money and desalination plant. In the developed and developing worlds alike, those without the means or conditions to diversify their water sources face peril. Water wars will rage, and communities will perish.\n\nThose communities fortunate enough to be able to engineer their way toward water security damn well better start thinking about it. Take it from La La Land: It's never too late to change.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n",

          "description": "We first told you about Canal House’s rule-breaking chicken thighs in 2015. Then, our Genius Recipes fearless leader Kristen Miglore described the skin as “impossibly crisp, enough so to satisfy your darkest fried chicken cravings.”\n\nBut they’re way easier than frying.\n\nFirst, you take everything you know about skin-on chicken and toss it out the window. Instead of searing over high heat, you get a cast-iron pan mostly warm, add the thighs, and leave them to tread their own path.\n\n15 or 20 or 30 minutes later, the fat will be rendered and the skin so crunchy a potato chip would feel jealous. Now flip and repeat.\n\nThe original version features both preserved and fresh lemon and, well, that’s it. Simple and timeless and chic, like a little black dress.\n\nIf you want to make a good thing better, Canal House founders Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer suggest a few accessories: Say, bacon and olives. Or sherry and mushrooms. Between you and me, water and cardboard, too, would be wonderful with this chicken. But I had another idea:\n\nKale and croutons.\n\nWhile the chicken takes its sweet time crisping up, we’ll bring a pot of salty water to a boil. Throw in a mountain of chopped Tuscan kale, also known as lacinato, also known as dinosaur—the shiny, deep green, crinkly kind. Cook for less time than most songs. This gives the kale a head start on sautéing, seasons and hydrates it, too.\n\nNow find a loaf of crusty bread. It could be fresh, made this morning and from your favorite bakery. Or it could be a forgotten in the back of the freezer, behind the coffee ice cream and frost-covered blueberries. Cut into thick slices, then tear into pieces with your hands.\n\nOh, look! The chicken is done. Transfer from the pan to a waiting plate. Leave all that schmaltz right where it is. Add the bread and toss in the fat, cooking until it starts to crisp and turn the color of dark honey. Now add minced garlic and chili flakes (because most things are better with them) and the kale. No need to squeeze or wring the kale out—that lingering water is welcome here, something like Italian pancotto. Nestle the chicken thighs on top. Serve them in the skillet. Or eat from the skillet. I find it tastes even better that way.\n\nCrispy Chicken Thighs with Kale & Croutons\n\nServes 3\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n\n3 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning chicken\n\n2 pinches freshly ground black pepper\n\n10 cups chopped Tuscan kale (about 10 ounces)\n\n3 cups torn bread chunks (about 6 ounces)\n\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced\n\n1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes\n\n1/2 lemon, juice of\n\nGo to Recipe \n\nHave you made the Canal House chicken thighs before?

          "description": "Increased welcome bonuses on popular travel rewards credit cards are a great way to earn a quick infusion of points or miles, and The Business Platinum® Card from American Express OPEN is currently offering just that, with a welcome bonus of up to 100,000 points. It’s also relatively common to see similar offers on the personal Platinum Card® from American Express through the CardMatch tool. If you’ve recently received (or are working towards) this welcome bonus, keep reading! Today I’ll go through some of the best ways to redeem your 100,000 Membership Rewards points.\n\nIt’s important to note that the following redemptions all involve transferring your points to one of the program’s 17 airline partners or 2 hotel partners, as this is typically the best way to redeem your Membership Rewards for maximum value. While you can use points directly for travel through the Amex Travel site, this generally won’t get you as much value as you’ll get through partner programs. While transferring does involve extra steps and you’re subject to some variable transfer times, it’s often worth the effort.\n\nIn addition, the Membership Rewards program requires you to link your various frequent flyer accounts with your Membership Rewards account before you initiate a transfer. Here’s how to do this:\n\nLogin to your account at americanexpress.com.\n\nClick on your Membership Rewards-earning card (if necessary), then click on Explore Rewards\n\nClick on the Transfer Points option, then click View All\n\nClick on the partner whose account you want to link\n\nSelect a card holder, verify your card details, enter the corresponding program’s account number, then click Link Account\n\nFrom there you’ll receive a confirmation that the link was successful and will be redirected to the Transfer Points page to complete the transaction:\n\nHowever, be sure you’ve checked award availability before transferring, since you can’t change your mind after the fact. Once a transfer has been initiated, it’s final!\n\nAnother note: you’ll need to pay a small fee whenever you transfer points into a US program like Delta SkyMiles or JetBlue TrueBlue, which will offset the federal excise tax that American Express must pay when you transfer points. But don’t be alarmed; it’s only $0.0006 (or six hundredths of 1 cent) per point and is capped at $99. You’re even given the option to use points to cover the expense, but I strongly encourage you to just pay for it, as you’ll only get a redemption value of 0.5 cents per point.\n\nSo with those details out of the way, what are some of the best ways to use 100,000 points?\n\n1. Up to Four Round-Trip Economy Flights to Hawaii\n\nIf Hawaii is on your list of dream destinations, the Membership Rewards program has you covered.\n\nThe first option is a popular one for many travelers: booking award flights to Hawaii. The Aloha State isn’t always easy to reach using points or miles, but the Membership Rewards program gives you a few great options. The first is for West Coast residents. By transferring points to British Airways, you can utilize the carrier’s distance-based award chart to book round-trip award flights to the islands for just 25,000 Avios. The gateways that fall within this band include nonstop flights from Los Angeles (LAX) and Phoenix (PHX) on American as well as nonstop flights from Seattle (SEA), Portland (PDX), San Diego (SAN), Oakland (OAK) and even Bellingham, Washington (BLI) on Alaska Airlines. Just be aware that you must call to redeem your Avios on Alaska-operated flights, and you may currently need to call for American ones as well, especially if you don’t want to utilize this irritating workaround.\n\nIf you don’t live on the West Coast, don’t fret! You can still get to Hawaii by transferring your Membership Rewards points to Air France/KLM’s Flying Blue program and redeeming them on Delta-operated flights. Flying Blue recently revamped its program and award prices are all over the map, so it’s impossible to predict exactly what awards will cost when redeeming this way. But we’ve found economy flights from New York (JFK) to Hawaii for as low as 35,000 miles round-trip, so it’s definitely an option under the right circumstances. Just be sure to check availability beforehand, as Delta doesn’t always release a ton of award seats.\n\n2. Round-Trip Business Class Ticket to Japan\n\nA round-trip ticket to Japan from the US is within your reach with 100,000 Membership Rewards points.\n\nIf you’d rather cross the entire Pacific Ocean and do so in style, consider transferring your Membership Rewards points to Virgin Atlantic. The London-based carrier isn’t part of a major alliance, instead partnering with various airlines and releasing different redemption schemes for each. But one of the more lucrative ones is on ANA. For just 90,000 miles, you can fly round-trip from Canada or the western US to Japan in business class. The price is just slightly higher (95,000 miles) for the central and eastern US, which includes New York and Washington, DC (IAD), and also applies to flights from Europe.\n\nHowever, it’s critical to note that you can’t book one-way award tickets on ANA through Flying Club, so you must find round-trip availability. This is where ExpertFlyer can come in handy, as you can set alerts for a variety of dates and then call to book as soon as you’re notified that seats have opened up.\n\n3. Up to Three Round-Trip Tickets to Spain\n\nIberia business class is a great option for your 100,000 Membership Rewards points, though you could get up to three round-trip economy flights as well!\n\nAnother lucrative transfer partner of the Membership Rewards program is Iberia. Like British Airways (its corporate cousin), the carrier uses Avios as its currency and follows a distance-based award chart. However, for flights on its own metal, you aren’t subject to the horrendous taxes and fees that you’d pay booking through British Airways.\n\nOne sweet spot is for East Coast residents: a round-trip, off-peak economy award ticket from either New York or Boston (BOS) to Madrid (MAD) would set you back just 34,000 Avios, which means you’d be able to get three of these award tickets with your haul of points. (Yes, that would technically be 102,000 Membership Rewards points. However, since you’d need to spend some money to earn the welcome bonus on either the personal or business Amex Platinum, I’m comfortable including it.)\n\nIf you’re looking to fly to Madrid from Miami (MIA), Chicago (ORD) or even Los Angeles (LAX), you can actually score round-trip economy award tickets for just 42,500 miles apiece, so you and a friend or spouse can get to Spain in this fashion. And if you’re feeling like traveling in style, a round-trip business class award ticket from these gateways to Madrid will be just 85,000 Avios. That’s a steal for transatlantic business class!\n\n4. Up to 25 One-Way Short-Haul Flights\n\nEarlier I noted a “sweet spot” redemption by transferring your Membership Rewards points to British Airways and redeeming them through the carrier’s distance-based award chart to get from the West Coast to Hawaii. While 25,000 Avios for that round-trip ticket can be a great value, you can also get tremendous value by looking at short haul flights.\n\nThrough the Executive Club program, British Airways or partner flights outside of North America that cover less than 651 miles in length are just 4,500 Avios apiece. In addition, if you book on the carrier’s own metal or that of Iberia or Aer Lingus and travel on off-peak dates, you’d only need 4,000 Avios! This can be a terrific redemption out of Oneworld hub airports, as these flights can be quite expensive (though be sure to check the cost of a paid ticket to make sure you’re getting a good value).\n\nAs an example or how far this can take you, here’s a map that shows the destinations within 651 miles of Tokyo (NRT), one of Japan Airlines’ main hubs:\n\nAs you can see, you could take virtually any flight within Japan and pay just 4,500 Avios each way!\n\nIn addition, you can take flights that are 1,151 miles or less in distance for just 7,500 Avios in each direction, giving you the option of booking six of these round-trip tickets with the Membership Rewards points you’d earn from the Amex Business Platinum.\n\n5. Round-Trip Business Class (or Maybe Even First) to Europe or Southern South America\n\nAnother transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards is Etihad Guest. While you likely won’t get much value transferring your points to Etihad and redeeming for flights on its own metal, there are some terrific redemption options on partner airlines. One of my favorites involves American — if you can find availability to either Europe or Southern South America (including Argentina, Chile and most of Brazil), you can book a round-trip flight for just 100,000 Etihad Guest miles. American would charge 115,000 AAdvantage miles for the same award.\n\nIn addition, reports indicate that Etihad applies the same pricing on these flights for both business and first class, so if you can find a seat in the “Z” fare class (American’s saver level first class inventory) on any of these routes, you should be able to book it for just 50,000 Etihad Guest miles each way. The only potential drawback is that you must call to book these, but the same story linked above has complete details on Etihad’s new-and-improved Serbian call center.\n\n100,000 miles for round-trip, long-haul business class is quite good. Getting that exact same price for first class is truly spectacular.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum card’s welcome bonus is a great way to unlock incredible redemptions.\n\nThe Membership Rewards program can give its members a ton of value, especially when you utilize its diverse set of transfer partners. By transferring your points to these airlines, you can extend their value far beyond the 1 cent per point that you can get for booking flights directly. If you’re set to score 100,000 points from either the Business Platinum card or the personal Platinum card, hopefully this post has given you some inspiration to start planning your next trip.\n",

          "description": "A recent Pew poll reveals increasing American polarization on attitudes to refugees.\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants are the most likely religious group to say that the United States has no responsibility to open its borders to refugees, according to a recent poll.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by Pew, found that 68 percent of white evangelicals believed that the United States “does not have a responsibility” to house refugees, while just 25 percent believes that it does. This is higher than the American national average: 51 percent of Americans overall believe the United States does have a responsibility to allow in refugees, while just 43 percent believe it does not.\n\nThe perspective of white evangelical Protestants on the refugee crisis is particularly striking because it’s relatively unusual among Christian religious groups. For example, 43 percent of white mainline Protestants believe that America has a responsibility to house refugees, as do 50 percent of Catholics and 63 percent of black Protestants. The highest level of support from any group cited in the study was from those who identified as religiously unaffiliated, of whom a full 65 percent support American housing of refugees.\n\nThe numbers are also remarkable because they reflect a more general trend on the part of white evangelical Christians to depart from the national average when it comes to social issues. White evangelicals are increasingly echoing the GOP party platform even as other groups, including Christian groups, diverge from it.\n\nSuch a conflation means that white evangelical Christians, already historically a major part of President Trump’s base (let’s not forget that 81 percent of them voted for him in 2016), are now becoming all but synonymous with it. As Trump’s policies become increasingly designed to appeal to that base (as, for example, with his recent move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem), it’s likewise increasingly clear that the relationship between the two is symbiotic.\n\nAnd the line between white evangelical theology and GOP party platform is all but disappearing.\n",

Eloy Jimenez, RF\n\nVideo\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2013 from Dominican Republic\n\nAge\n\n20\n\nHeight\n\n6’4\n\nWeight\n\n205\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/50\n\n70/80\n\n50/70\n\n45/40\n\n45/50\n\n60/60\n\nJimenez was largely compared head-to-head with now-Yankees SS Gleyber Torres as the top talents in the loaded 2013 July 2nd class. Both players signed with the Cubs, then later were traded as headliners in blockbuster trades for Aroldis Chapman and Jose Quintana, respectively.\n\nJimenez has developed as many hoped he would as an amateur, already showing 70 game power due to a rare feel for hitting from a prospect with potential 80 raw power. He also has a rare level of baseball-specific athleticism that allows him to play a solid right field while doing these things, a combination present in players like Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge, even if Jimenez likely won’t be that level of player. He’s continued to exhibit that rare playability of rare tools early in 2018 and seems on track for a big-league audition late this summer at age 21.\n\n60 FV Prospects\n\n2. Michael Kopech, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2014 from Mt. Pleasant HS (TX)\n\nAge\n\n21\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n205\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n70/70\n\n50/60\n\n45/55\n\n40/45\n\nKopech was frustrating for scouts earlier in his high-school career, as his quick arm was obscured by a long arm action and inconsistent delivery that led to inconsistent velocity, secondary pitches, and command. Just before the draft, his quick arm became even quicker and, early in pro ball, he was able to make his arm action a little shorter, unlocking perhaps the best fastball in the minor leagues. Depending on the gun, Kopech tops out at 102 or 105 mph and his plus slider gives him a clear second weapon.\n\nAs you may guess, there are some concerns about the command. Also, his changeup remains inconsistent and there are health questions simply because throwing that hard puts a greater level of stress on an arm than throwing 90 mph. He’s now performed at the upper level and is ready to fine-tune his game with a big-league look at some point in 2018. He’s not a finished product, though the loud stuff gives him a large margin for error.\n\n3. Luis Robert, CF\n\nVideo\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2017 from Cuba\n\nAge\n\n19\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n185\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n25/50\n\n65/65\n\n30/55\n\n60/60\n\n45/55\n\n60/60\n\nChicago signed Robert for $26 million just weeks before the new CBA put a hard cap on international spending. He had been of interest to international scouts for several years because of his precocious combination of raw power and speed. About a year before he signed, Robert looked heavy and sluggish on tour with the Cuban national team in the U.S., but by the time he defected and was ready to work out for teams he had transformed his physique, putting on an absolute show in his open workout. He showed plus straight-line speed and plus power during BP.\n\nRobert doesn’t have great bat control and his ability to get the bat to the baseball might be limited, but there’s enough going on here that he has a chance to be a star anyway (teammate and fellow countryman Yoan Moncada has similar limitations). If the bat does come, he’ll be a five-tool monster at a premium position. He had a wrist injury that he’s been rehabbing in Arizona at the White Sox’ spring-training facility, but made his first appearance in a game yesterday. He’ll head to High-A Winston-Salem when he’s deemed ready.\n\n50 FV Prospects\n\n4. Alec Hansen, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2016 from Oklahoma\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’7\n\nWeight\n\n235\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n60/60\n\n45/50\n\n60/60\n\n40/45\n\n40/45\n\nA talented enigma at Oklahoma, Hansen’s prodigious stuff was finally deployed with some consistency in 2017, as he struck out a whopping 191 hitters in 141.1 innings. His fastball and curveball are both plus, while his changeup, slider, and command remain fringey. Nevertheless, fringe command is still more than a grade better than what Hansen showed in college. He’s progressing but remains a volatile prospect with No. 2/3 starter potential. Hansen has had a slow start to 2018, staying back in extended spring training in Arizona. Eric saw him pitch recently, though, and said he looked healthy and almost back to his former self.\n\n5. Zack Burdi, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2016 from Louisville\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n205\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n80/80\n\n60/65\n\n55/60\n\n40/45\n\nBurdi had Tommy John surgery in July and will miss most of 2018, if not all of it. He’s also a reliever with lots of effort in his delivery. Once you get past those two things, there’s only good news: he sits 97-100 and hits 102 mph, his slider is regularly plus to plus-plus, and he’s developed a changeup that’s also plus at times. The rare combination of a plus three-pitch mix and enough command to have some idea where it’s going makes him a near unicorn. From the White Sox’ perspective, the risk isn’t so great as one might think at first glance: they only need him to be healthy for his six controlled years, throwing 20-30 pitches at a time, and he was almost big-league ready before surgery. Look for Burdi to deliver on his first-round pedigree as an elite reliever for the Sox in 2019, with the upside of one of the top five relievers in the game, but plenty of risk for obvious reasons.\n\n6. Zack Collins, 1B\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2016 from Miami\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n220\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/40\n\n70/70\n\n40/65\n\n20/20\n\n40/45\n\n50/50\n\nScouts think it’s pretty unlikely that Collins catches, at least full-time. Even with that strike against him, though — not to mention a strikeout-heavy offensive profile — it’s still likely that his combination of tireless patience and plus-plus raw power enables him to reach base and slug enough to profile even at first base. Collins could end up resembling the 2017 version of Eric Thames, except with the added value of being able to catch once in a while.\n\nWhile it doesn’t show up in his tool grades, Collins has plus-plus pitch recognition that may be best in the minors among prospects, which helps him get to his power in games and rack up walks to prop up a low batting average. His is a profile of extremes, but the end result is a solid, perhaps bland, everyday first baseman, something like a better version of Pedro Alvarez.\n\n7. Dane Dunning, RHP\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2016 from Florida\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’4\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n55/55\n\n55/60\n\n50/55\n\n45/50\n\nDunning was a projection arm in high school who would run it up to 93 mph at times but did it inconsistently enough with a high enough price tag to get to the University of Florida. Despite occupying a number of roles in a deep Gators staff, Dunning excelled in Gainesville, in large part due to a heavy sinker that reached 96 mph with excellent extension. He’s also flashed an abov- average two-plane breaking ball, changeup, and command at times, which is why scouts envisioned him in a starting role.\n\nAs expected, he’s blossomed in the pros after going in the late first round and was one of the three pieces in the Adam Eaton deal, moving from Washington to the White Sox with Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez. He should spend 2018 in the upper levels and may get a look in September, but more conservatively in early 2019.\n\n45 FV Prospects\n\n8. Dylan Cease, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 6th Round, 2014 from Milton HS (GA)\n\nAge\n\n21\n\nHeight\n\n6’2\n\nWeight\n\n190\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n70/70\n\n55/60\n\n45/50\n\n40/45\n\nCease showed upper-90s velo and a potential plus breaking ball as a high-school underclassman and he’s still largely that guy, despite having encountered a couple road blocks since then. Cease was an overslot sixth-rounder in 2014, part of the same the Cubs draft in which they got Kyle Schwarber for a discount with their first pick. Cease has also had a Tommy John surgery and, on the field, has quieted his mechanics a bit, giving him a shot to start.\n\nThat being said, he’s still more a thrower than a pitcher, relying more on his power fastball/curveball combo with his changeup/command lagging behind. The fastball is still really good: 94-96, topping at 101 mph in 2016, with good extension to his delivery and plane that works well up in the zone, where he tends to deliver it. Odds are he ends up in the bullpen operating in the late innings, but he’s had a largely healthy and productive 2017 and first part of 2018 in a rotation, so there’s still a chance Cease puts it all together.\n\n9. Micker Adolfo, RF\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2013 from Dominican Republic\n\nAge\n\n20\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/40\n\n65/70\n\n40/55\n\n50/45\n\n40/50\n\n60/60\n\nAdolfo had loud tools and questionable hitability when he was an elite July 2nd prospect, and that’s still largely the report on him. The feel aspects of the game (including defensive instincts) still largely elude him, but that’s possibly just a product of youth. On the positive side, the raw power projects for plus-plus, and his arm strength is a plus, too. The bat speed is also plus, and there’s some twitch to his game that keeps his upside high.\n\nLike Eloy Jimenez, Adolfo has demonstrated an ability to get to his big raw power in games, even while facing older competition. Unlike Jimenez, Adolfo’s pitch selection and bat control are still both below average, but early returns this year suggest he may be making some progress in both areas.\n\n10. Jake Burger, 3B\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2017 from Missouri State\n\nAge\n\n21\n\nHeight\n\n6’2\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/50\n\n65/65\n\n45/55\n\n45/30\n\n40/45\n\n60/60\n\nBurger has a surprising amount of twitch, bat control, and baseball athleticism in his game for such a thick, husky frame. He isn’t especially loose or athletic in a football or overall sense, but he has explosive hands that create huge raw power, solid first-step quickness despite a more ordinary top speed, and plus arm strength. Burger knows what he is and is geared to lift the ball and hit for power, so the offensive questions revolve around maintaining his athleticism in the box and picking good enough pitches to get to his power in games, with which he’s struggled a bit against better competition.\n\nDefensively, he’ll always need some work to stick at third base, and most scouts think he eventually slides over the first, but it’s up to him how long it will be until that happens. Burger will miss all of 2018 and likely some of 2019 with a torn Achilles, which will likely put more pressure on him both offensively and defensively.\n\n11. Blake Rutherford, LF\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2016 from Chaminade Prep HS (CA)\n\nAge\n\n20\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n195\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/55\n\n50/50\n\n30/50\n\n50/45\n\n40/50\n\n45/45\n\nRutherford was a hyped southern California prep prospect. Some scouts thought he was a bit overheated since he was older than his peers his whole amateur career, but no one doubted his feel to hit. The Yankees went over slot to get him in the middle of the first round in 2016 but traded him to the White Sox last year in the deal than landed them bullpen help in David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle.\n\nOnce in pro ball and facing his prospect age peers, Rutherford’s offensive skills appeared less impressive, with power and loft absent from his (still pretty) game swing. He also lost a little athleticism: once conceivably an outfield tweener, he now looks like a definite left fielder. This has made the loft/power issues more important. The feel to hit is still there, though, so if Rutherford can make some gains in the power department, there’s still low-end everyday upside here; it’s just less exciting than it appeared when he was arguably the top high-school junior in the country.\n\n40 FV Prospects\n\n12. Ryan Cordell, RF\n\nDrafted: 11th Round, 2013 from Liberty\n\nAge\n\n25\n\nHeight\n\n6’4\n\nWeight\n\n195\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n40/45\n\n55/55\n\n45/50\n\n60/60\n\n50/50\n\n55/55\n\nCordell has an unusual profile, a late-blooming 6-foot-4 athlete with plus speed, above-average raw power and arm strength, but no clear position. He’s tried the infield in recent years but doesn’t have the instincts to play anywhere other than an outfield corner at this point. Cordell has shown flashes of feel to hit and starting lifting the ball more in recent years to help him get to his raw power in games. By the end of 2018 or early 2019, he’ll be ready for a big league look to see if he can turn everyday tools into an everyday player or just a solid bench piece.\n\n13. Carson Fulmer, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2015 from Vanderbilt\n\nAge\n\n23\n\nHeight\n\n6’0\n\nWeight\n\n195\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCutter\n\nCommand\n\n50/50\n\n55/55\n\n55/55\n\n60/60\n\n40/45\n\nFulmer has been a big name since his underclassman days in high school around 2011, when he’d run his fastball into the mid-90s while showing impressive athleticism and a three-pitch mix from a delivery that pointed to relief. He’s since made a number of changes to his mechanics, giving some scouts hope that he can stick as a starter — and he is, technically, a big-league starter right now. That said, Fulmer’s always leaned more to the power in his game and has always had some effort to his delivery, along with a quicker tempo that makes it hard to repeat that delivery. So, despite performing in the SEC and earning a place among the top 10 picks in his draft, it’s largely the same set of tools (albeit with a new cutter developed last year). He seems to be in that nexus where neither a traditional starting role nor one-inning relief spot make sense, so he may settle in a fireman, multi-inning type role in the end.\n\n14. Gavin Sheets, 1B\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2017 from Wake Forest\n\nAge\n\n21\n\nHeight\n\n6’4\n\nWeight\n\n230\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/L\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/50\n\n70/70\n\n40/55\n\n30/30\n\n40/50\n\n50/50\n\nSheets has patience and huge raw power from the left side, but he doesn’t actualize the latter as much as you’d like to see, instead exhibiting a flatter swing plane than the platonic ideal of this profile, like Zack Collins. For a 22-year old first-day college pick with not much value in the speed or defensive departments, Sheets needs to figure how to find that happy medium of contact, patience, and power to avoid going down the same road as Casey Gillaspie (a former first-rounder who missed this list) and something more like what Jameson Fisher is doing when it comes to approach and launchangle adjustments.\n\n15. A.J. Puckett, RHP\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2016 from Pepperdine\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’4\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n50/50\n\n45/50\n\n55/60\n\n45/55\n\nPuckett wasn’t a well-known name to the public in the 2016 draft, but some teams loved him for his aggressive pitching style and the separators he possessed, both in his changeup and feel to pitch. He was traded to the White Sox from the Royals last year in the Melky Cabrera deal and projects as a back-end starter who eats innings and gets the most out of his stuff. It’s a nice type to have in a system full of more volatile, relief-risk type power arms, but the strikeout rates and prospect rankings will probably never excite White Sox fans.\n\n16. Luis Gonzalez, RF\n\nDrafted: 3rd Round, 2017 from New Mexico\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’1\n\nWeight\n\n185\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/L\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/55\n\n50/50\n\n30/45\n\n50/50\n\n45/50\n\n50/50\n\nGonzalez doesn’t have huge tools. With the exception of a 55 on the bat, everything else gets average grades across the board from scouts. He profiles as an outfield tweener who can play all three spots but doesn’t have the traditional everyday profile for any of those same three spots. Gonzalez has above-average bat control and pitch selection but more of a line-drive approach that doesn’t tap into all of his raw power, so he fits more as a solid platoon/role-player type than a true everyday player.\n\n17. Seby Zavala, C\n\nDrafted: 12th Round, 2015 from San Diego State\n\nAge\n\n23\n\nHeight\n\n5’11\n\nWeight\n\n215\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/40\n\n60/60\n\n40/50\n\n30/30\n\n40/45\n\n45/45\n\nZavala was a later-round pick due in part to questions about his defensive quality behind the plate and his arm strength after Tommy John surgery. He’s worked his way to serviceable but is still likely more of an offensive-minded backup than an everyday quality defensive catcher. He exploded to hit 21 homers in 2017 largely by putting the ball in the air more often, helping him get to his plus raw power in games. His pitch selection and bat control are both fringy, so Zavala is more of a passable catcher who will hit for power in a part-time role than a traditional potential starting catching prospect, but there’s an obvious role for players like this in today’s game.\n\n18. Luis Alexander Basabe, CF\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2012 from Venezuela\n\nAge\n\n20\n\nHeight\n\n6’0\n\nWeight\n\n160\n\nBat/Throw\n\nS/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n25/40\n\n45/50\n\n30/50\n\n60/60\n\n40/50\n\n60/60\n\nBasabe came over as one of the lesser pieces in the Chris Sale trade but with tantalizing upside. A plus runner, he has a center-field profile with average raw power and some twitch. He had a tough 2017, as his swing broke down a bit when he got too big and power-oriented. A combination of below-average bat control and some nagging injuries seemed to produce inconsistent contact quality. Basabe can still turn into an average defensive center fielder with plus run and throw tools, so the profile has some give on the offensive side. Early reports are he’s making progress in terms of quality contact this year, so he may be on the rise.\n\n19. Ian Clarkin, LHP\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2013 from Madison HS (CA)\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’2\n\nWeight\n\n215\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/L\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n45/45\n\n60/60\n\n50/55\n\n45/50\n\nClarkin was a first-round pick out of a southern California high school in 2013 due, in part, to a heater that ran into the mid-90s and starter traits, but mostly because of his plus curveball. He still has all of those things and projects as a back-end starter, but his velocity has backed up a bit (88-91, touching 93 mph) due to Tommy John surgery and the rigors of regular pitching in pro ball. Given the plus breaking ball, if Clarkin’s stuff doesn’t play as a starter, he can always be a matchup reliever.\n\n20. Spencer Adams, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2014 from White County HS (GA)\n\nAge\n\n21\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n171\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n50/50\n\n50/55\n\n45/50\n\n45/55\n\nIn his draft year, Adams had a velo spike, hitting 96 mph. That, combined with athleticism and four pitches that graded out to average or better, allowed scouts to project mid-rotation potential. He’s still a solid athlete who runs it up to 95 mph at times with a four-pitch mix, but the velocity has settled at 90-92 mph and the slider has improved in pro ball and overtaken the curveball as his main offspeed weapon. Adams throws a lot of strikes and doesn’t have a traditional out pitch, so he fits as a back-end type along with the other starters in this range.\n\n21. Tyler Danish, RHP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2013 from Durant HS (FL)\n\nAge\n\n22\n\nHeight\n\n6’0\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n45/45\n\n50/55\n\n50/55\n\n45/50\n\nDanish has always had great feel to pitch. He’s also always had a truly awkward-looking arm action and a delivery that puts a lot of stress on his arm. His low arm slot generates lots of life on his sinker, but he’s endured diminished velocity in recent years as many scouts predicted, the pitch sitting 88-90 and hitting 93 mph but also playing down a bit due to his short stride. He still knows how to sequence hitters — and his slider and changeup flash above average — but he, like Fulmer, may fit best in a one-time-through-the-order relief role.\n\n22. Jameson Fisher, LF\n\nDrafted: 4th Round, 2016 from Southeast Lousiana\n\nAge\n\n23\n\nHeight\n\n6’2\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n40/55\n\n45/45\n\n30/45\n\n45/40\n\n40/50\n\n40/40\n\nFisher was one of the best performers in the country in his draft year out of Southeast Louisiana, but his lack of impact power as a corner outfielder pushed him down to the fourth round. He’s continued to perform in pro ball, abandoning the more line-drive-oriented approach of his amateur days and adding loft to his swing. Now he looks something like a solid platoon left fielder, though it’s still a hit-over-power profile. Rays right fielder Jake Bauers is a superior version of Fisher due to more twitch and athleticism, but there is some track record of advanced hitters with good pitch selection and ordinary power learning to lift the ball while adding some strength and developing more raw power along the way. The upside isn’t huge, but Fisher is making the necessary improvements to get there.\n\n23. Aaron Bummer, LHP\n\nDrafted: 19th Round, 2014 from Nebraska\n\nAge\n\n23\n\nHeight\n\n6’3\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat/Throw\n\nL/L\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n60/60\n\n50/50\n\n50/50\n\n40/40\n\nBummer is a sturdy lefty with a plus sinker that sits 92-94, hitting 96 mph, and two average offspeed pitches. Normally that adds up to a starter, but Bummer doesn’t have the cleanest delivery, instead fitting best in short stints where his command is better and he’s not forced to turn over a lineup. This year he’s been able to bring the effectiveness he had in the minors into a big-league role and should be losing prospect eligibility soon. He is one of the only players on this list who is a finished product, with the same present value as future value (40).\n\n24. Jordan Stephens, RHP\n\nDrafted: 5th Round, 2015 from Rice\n\nAge\n\n24\n\nHeight\n\n6’1\n\nWeight\n\n190\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\n55/55\n\n50/50\n\n55/60\n\n40/45\n\n45/50\n\nStephens pitched at Rice. That fact alone is often enough to scare most teams, due to the injury history of the program’s alums. Stephens got his Tommy John surgery before the draft and slid a few rounds to the fifth, so the White Sox thought they were getting a nice value and it appears they were right so far. Stephens sits 90-93 and hits 95 mph with a hard curveball that flashes plus and a separate slider that’s also solid. His command should be enough to continue to start, but his changeup is below average, so he’ll need to figure out a way to get high-level left-handed hitters out reliably. After a quick start to the season in Double-A, Stephens is now in Triple-A and may get a big-league look late in 2018.\n\n25. Danny Mendick, SS\n\nDrafted: 22nd Round, 2015 from UMass Lowell\n\nAge\n\n23\n\nHeight\n\n5’10\n\nWeight\n\n189\n\nBat/Throw\n\nR/R\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n45/55\n\n40/40\n\n20/30\n\n45/45\n\n45/50\n\n50/50\n\nMendick is a familiar type amongst fringe prospects: a later-round, small-school, senior-sign middle infielder with good makeup who compensates for a lack of tools by hitting more than expected. Mendick is okay at short and a hair above average at second base, where he fits better due to his average arm strength. He doesn’t have much raw power but has learned to lift the ball more in recent years. The headliner here is his above-average hit tool — due mostly to above-average pitch selection and bat control — which should allow him to hang around for a while and possibly carve out a nice big-league career.\n\nOther Prospects of Note\nGrouped by type and listed in order of preference within each category.\n\nCorner Bats\nMatt Rose, 1B\nDaniel Palka, 1B/RF\nJustin Yurchak, 1B\nCasey Gillaspie, 1B\nAlex Call, RF\nLuis Curbelo, 3B\n\nRose was the last cut from the list: he’s playable at third but below average and fits better at first base, where he has fringe contact skills but plus power. The wrong side of a first-base platoon is a tough profile, but he’s in Double-A and has performed the whole way. Palka has a little more pop and is left-handed but also older and with worse pitch recognition that should dampen some of that power against elite pitching. Yurchak is another tweener who fits best at first and lacks huge power but has bat-to-ball skills and very good pitch selection. Since college, Gillaspie has had trouble getting to his power in games, with a flatter swing plane and more contact-oriented approach, which it sounds like he’s trying to remedy this year but is having a rough go of it.\n\nUp-the-Middle Bats\nEvan Skoug, C/1B\nTito Polo, CF\nCharlie Tilson, CF\nLenyn Sosa, 2B\nAmado Nunez, 2B\n\nSkoug has poor bat control and receiving skills but solid power and patience that could help him carve out a bench role. Nunez and Sosa are athletic young infielders with bat control and some defensive value, but are pretty raw at the plate.\n\nProjected Relievers\nThyago Vieira, RHP\nJace Fry, LHP\nTyler Johnson, RHP\nBrandon Brennan, RHP\nVictor Diaz, RHP\nConnor Walsh, RHP\nJake Elliott, RHP\nZach Thompson, RHP\nJake Johansen, RHP\nIan Hamilton, RHP\nYosmer Solorzano, RHP\n\nVieira sits 96-100 and hits 102 mph, mixing in a solid-average breaking ball with some control but little command and fastball life. Fry has five pitches, all average to a bit above, and decent command but has fit best in the pen since his second Tommy John surgery. Johnson has three average or better pitches and runs his heater into the high-90s but has delivery issues and was overused at South Carolina, which led to arm issues. Brennan sits 93-97 mph with a heavy sinker and mixes in a plus changeup, but his command and breaking ball are both below average. Similarly, Diaz is up to 100 mph with an even better changeup but sits normally in the mid-90s with a below-average breaking ball and command. Walsh is up to 98 mph and mixes in a plus curveball but may have the worst command of this whole bunch of flamethrowers. Thompson is long and lanky with a power sinker up to 94 mph and a three-pitch mix that all flash above average, but has always had fastball command issues and seems like a pen fit.\n\nProjected Starters\nKade McClure, RHP\nLincoln Henzman, RHP\nBernardo Flores, LHP\nJordan Guerrero, LHP\n\nMcClure is 6-foot-7 and also came from Louisville with a innings-eater profile: 90-94, touching 95 mph, with good extension, and a slider and changeup that both flash above average at times. Henzman was an effective three-pitch reliever (heater up to 95 mph, hard slider and change) at Louisville whom the White Sox are trying as a starter. Flores’ velo was way down in 2017 (he was up to 96 mph after signing in 2016, then sat 86-89 mph in 2017), but he still has a shot to succeed due to an above-average curveball and changeup to go with good feel to pitch. Guerrero sits 88-91 mph with his sinker and has three fringy pitches that he uses to get to his plus changeup.\n\nCistulli’s Guy\nSelected by Carson Cistulli from any player who received less than a 40 FV.\n\nTi’Quan Forbes, 2B/3B\nForbes has more pedigree than most of the players who appear in this space, having received a $1.2 million bonus from the Texas Rangers, who selected him out of a Mississippi high school in the second round of the 2014 draft. In the meantime, however, his stock has dropped: he appeared 13th on the Rangers list in the 2014-15 offseason, then 23rd in the 2015-16, and the Other Prospects section last year.\n\nTraded to the White Sox at the end of last August in the deal that sent Miguel Gonzalez to Texas, Forbes has made considerably more contact so far this season than in years past, cutting his strikeout rate nearly in half relative to his previously established levels. He’s repeating High-A, but he’s also still just 21 years old, which places him on the young side for the level. The athleticism, the emerging contact skills, and the infield defense (he’s been used at second and third base exclusively this year) conspire to create a promising profile.\n\nSystem Overview\n\nThe White Sox seem to have some clear tendencies in the types of prospects they have acquired during this rebuild overseen by GM Rick Hahn: power arms rather than command ones, power bats rather than contact ones, prospects with pedigree over late bloomers. It’s produced a top-heavy system with 10-12 premium prospects for whom it’s easy to see a role on a championship club followed by depth types that are more single-tool back-of-the-roster players with limited upside than projection types with big upside. By contrast, the Braves and Padres did the same thing in their rebuilds with top-tier prospects, largely speaking, and continued looking for upside with lower-level players as well.\n\nThat’s more just a description of what’s here than a criticism, as the top two prospects, Jimenez and Kopech, were headliners in key blockbuster trades that have performed even better than most expected. They’re the types of trades that dictate if a GM keeps his job and/or if a rebuild has a chance to work in the end. There has been a college lean to the organization’s top picks in recent years, so it’s possible that the top 10 guys here will be in Double-A or higher at the end of the year. With some of the core already in Chicago, it seems like the plan is to be competitive sooner than later.\n",

          "description": "It’s often been said that wisdom is the art of knowing that you are not wise.\n\nThe great philosopher Socrates famously denied being wise more than two thousand years ago, and since then, we have taken him at his word.\n\nThere is a truth there, but that definition isn’t very helpful. I mean, I’m all for respecting uncertainty, doubting oneself, and realizing the limitations of my mind, but I think we can do better. Maybe even take a few steps forward.\n\nMore importantly, I think we can create our own definition that separates it from just mere intelligence and then use that definition to illustrate why the distinction matters and how we can practically engage it in everyday life.\n\nIntelligence is commonly associated with knowing something. Often, it also means that we can confidently apply what we know in a particular context.\n\nWisdom, to me, is different. It’s different because it has more dimensions. Wisdom not only knows, but it also understands. And the distinction between knowing and understanding is what makes things interesting.\n\nKnowing is generally factual. You have learned a particular kind of knowledge and you know its truth as it applies to a particular problem.\n\nUnderstanding, however, is more fluid. You have learned a particular kind of knowledge, but you don’t see it as a fact or a truth applied rigidly to one thing. Rather, you understand that knowledge’s essence and you can see how it relates to everything else, with nuances and contradictions included.\n\nThe difference is subtle but potent. While intelligence gives you specific utility, wisdom inspires flexible versatility. It provides a more textured lens for interacting with reality, very much changing how you think.\n\nBuilding relational knowledge\n\nEvery time you have a perspective shift, big or small, you gain knowledge.\n\nYou learn something new that you maybe didn’t know before, and as a result, your mind then changes itself regarding whatever that knowledge pertains to in the future. Next time, there is an added clarity.\n\nIf the acquired knowledge is understood, rather than just known, however, there is another step that occurs every time your mind shifts.\n\nIf you’re a student, for example, and you’re writing an exam, and it’s a difficult one, let’s say you decide to cheat. Now, unfortunately, when you cheat, you get caught. It leads to a failing grade in the course.\n\nThe thing to learn from this experience that would add to your intelligence would be the fact that cheating on an exam has consequences, and those consequences, while improbable, have a disproportionately negative impact on your life. It’s simply not worth it in the future.\n\nThe extra step that would translate the intelligence in that particular scenario into broadly applicable wisdom would be to realize that not only is it not worth cheating on an exam due to the harsh consequences, but that most things in the world that carry disproportionately costly risks should be approached cautiously, whether they be financial decisions or personal life choices.\n\nThis is, of course, a very simplified scenario, but the point is that knowledge is relational and the understanding of wisdom recognizes that rather than treating it simply as an isolated information point.\n\nInstead of the lesson being that cheating is bad, you combine the essence of the knowledge learned from that experience with your existing latticework of previous knowledge to really hammer home the underlying principle.\n\nThis way, you understand how taking shortcuts may harm your personal relationships, how your new understanding of risk may inform your business practices, and how what you say matters beyond why you say it.\n\nKnowledge is always best leveraged when it’s connected to other knowledge.\n\nCreating an information network\n\nIn network science, there is a now-famous effect called Metcalfe’s law.\n\nIt was first used to describe the growth of telecommunication networks, but over time, the application has been extended beyond that. It essentially states that the value of a network rises with the number of connected users.\n\nIn any network, each thing of interest is a node and the connection between such things is a link. The number of nodes themselves don’t necessarily reflect the value of a network, but the number of links between those nodes do.\n\nFor example, ten independent phones by themselves aren’t really all that useful. What makes them useful is the connection that they have to other phones. And the more they are connected to other phones, the more useful they are because the more access they have to each other.\n\nWell, the relationship between different kinds of knowledge in our mind works the same way. The more connected they are to each other, the more valuable the information network that we have in our brain is.\n\nEvery time you gain knowledge, you are either isolating it within a narrow context where it’s addressing a particular problem, or you are breaking it down a little further so that you can connect that knowledge to the already existing information you’ve accumulated so far.\n\nIn this scenario, intelligence is found within a pocket of information by itself. Wisdom, however, is accumulated in the process of creating new links.\n\nEach node of knowledge in your mind is a mental model of some aspect of reality, but that mental model isn’t fully complete until it’s been stripped down and re-contextualized in light of the information contained in the other mental models of knowledge around it.\n\nThe only way to acquire wisdom is to think in terms of the whole information network rather than the individual nodes that it contains.\n\nThat’s where nuance is considered; that’s where the respect for complexity comes in; and that’s how specialized information finds it flexibility.\n\nThe strength of your mind depends on the value of your information network.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe quest for wisdom is an age-old effort. It’s one many have recommended.\n\nIt’s been said to be as useful for finding inner contentment as it for fueling external successes. It’s a more prudent way of interacting with reality.\n\nWhile not everyone’s definition of wisdom is the same, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to distinguish it by a mode of deeper understanding. One that goes beyond just the knowing we commonly associate with intelligence.\n\nWhen we think of the acquisition of intelligence, we think of new information inspired by a perspective-shift that tells us a truth about one aspect of reality.\n\nWisdom goes further than that. It strips that same information down to its essence so that it can relate the underlying principle of that knowledge to the existing information network that exists in the mind.\n\nIt’s the connectedness of this network that separates it from mere intelligence.\n\nThe more links between each pocket of information, the more valuable the whole network will be when tackling any other problem. It adds an extra dimension to each mental model contained in the mind.\n\nSimply knowing this doesn’t make a person more equipped to soak in wisdom, but with awareness and practice, new thinking patterns can be created.\n\nThe way you do this shapes everything else. It’s worth working on.\n\nWant to think and live smarter?

          "description": "“You rarely learn anything while your mouth is open,” says Simon Letchford, managing director of Scotwork, a consulting company that specializes in corporate negotiations.\n\nThe truism is top of mind right now as he watches US president Donald Trump prep for a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea, over denuclearization. Neither leader is exactly known for his ability to stop talking and listen, Letchford says. But he’s observed executives with decades of negotiation experience in high-pressure situations nevertheless make the same mistake: “They tend to confuse negotiating with persuasion,” he says.\n\nRather than trying to convince people of your world view, Letchford argues, “there’s usually much more value to be had in a deal by being curious about the other side’s needs and priorities. And, he adds, you’re more likely to walk away from a bargaining discussion feeling satisfied if you can train your ear for “verbal tells,” which can betray a person’s position in ways they may not be aware of. Paying attention to these easy-to-miss signals can be the difference between reaching a deal or not.\n\nEven the most guarded negotiating partner will offer a few tells—for instance, with word choice. When a person says, “That would be really difficult,” most of us hear that as a “no,” but we ought to remain curious. As Letchford notes, difficult is not the same as impossible. So ask, “What would make that possible?”\n\nThe fact is, we commonly ignore hedging words like “about” or “around” that we mentally discount as fillers, because we’re primed to pay more attention to negative messages. If someone says, “I need it to come down by about 12%,” says Letchford, “what they’re really saying is, ‘I don’t need 12%.’”\n\nIndeed, one tiny qualifier can radically change the tenor of a discussion. That’s why Carol Dweck, the Stanford University professor behind the “growth mindset” theory, encourages managers to tack on the word “yet” when offering feedback, to keep clear “a pathway to the future” that can be signaled to the recipient of the feedback. It’s also just the sort of sentiment that could take a negotiation to a new level, if you’re listening for it.\n\nIn many cases, one sentence will contain several tells that likewise could serve as signposts. Take: “I can’t do that right now,” Letchford offers, which could be interpreted in a handful of ways.\n\nWhat most people will hear is “no,” which would close off unexplored avenues. But a better negotiator will say, “Okay, you can’t do that right now, so maybe later? What would make that happen?” says Letchford. An even more alert negotiator, he continues, would seize on the “I.” Maybe you need to bring in someone else who can make your request happen. Finally, a champion deal maker would be attuned to the “that.” If not “that,” you might respond, is there something else that could be done?\n\nThat kind of listening is a skill that used to come naturally to us, says Letchford. Children, he says, are inherently more curious, and typically not embarrassed to ask questions that reveal what they don’t know. Adults are far more addicted to their own Kool-Aid, and are more fearful of being exposed for not being in the know on something, for instance when they hear an acronym they’ve never encountered before. As we age, Letchford says, we lose “the art of really actively hearing what the other side is saying.”\n\nIn their training sessions, Scotwork’s consultants will film clients in mock negotiations and analyze the tape with them afterward, looking for missed opportunities. Watching the playback, most people are stunned to see what they missed when they believed they were listening—which is why, Letchford says, it’s always prudent to have an extra pair of ears on a call, or at the table.\n\nLately, computational analyses of large data banks of text have uncovered surprising language patterns. We now know, for instance, that people with depression use certain words more often than others do, including personal pronouns (“I,” “me,” and “myself”) and absolutist words (“always,” “nothing,” “completely”). In minutes, we can detect bias in textbooks and measure voter sentiment toward election candidates.\n\nUntil we figure out how to bring the same computational power to the negotiating table, you can train yourself to scan language for patterns just by paying attention.\n",

          "description": "This question originally appeared on Quora: What are some ways that men imagined themselves as fathers before they had children that turned out to be off-base? Answer by Josh Levs, Author of All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families and Businesses.\n\nWhen your dream becomes real, it becomes very real.\n\nThat’s a line I came up with when my career took off. But it applies just as much to parenthood—life’s greatest adventure for those who wish to partake in it.\n\nOf course, there are ways we all idealized what parenthood may be like and how we’d handle some of the challenges. That said, adages about everyone inevitably repeating their parents’ mistakes are false and ridiculous.\n\nToday’s fathers are carving out new terrain for a new era. Having done loads of research and interviews, including for my book All In, I see how incredibly far fatherhood has come. For generations, many women and some men have fought for gender equality. Our generation is now the beneficiary. One of the gifts we’ve received is that dads are free to build emotional, deep connections with our children—and most of us, by far, are making efforts to be there for all the moments.\n\nBut a powerful set of structures remain that prevent dads from having as much time with their kids as they hoped for: a network of laws, policies and stigmas that are straight out of the Mad Men era. This is where many fathers, and mothers as well, find that what they imagined turned out to be off-base.\n\nMany people in my generation (I’m in my 40s) grew up thinking gender equality was going to be real, allowing us truly equal opportunities at work and at home. The girls I knew were just as capable and driven. And in college, when we talked about how we envisioned our futures, we spoke in similar terms about work and family.\n\nBut while we were shaped by a new era, workplaces are still stuck in the past.\n\nFor example, the lack of paid maternity leave in the US, as I explained at the United Nations, is based on the assumption that women should stay home while men make all the money.\n\nThe net result is that the US is the only nation with any kind of developed economy—almost the only nation in the world—that doesn’t make sure that when a child is born, it has a parent at home and food on the table for at least a block of weeks.\n\nNext, men often don’t have access to any paternity leave. About 40% of workers are not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires unpaid leave. Many companies that do fall under FMLA aren’t providing paternity leave anyway. And only 15% of companies offer any paid paternity leave. Most families can’t afford unpaid leave.\n\nBut even more powerful than the laws and policies are the stigmas. Men have been fired, demoted, and lost job opportunities for taking paternity leave or seeking a flexible schedule. Far too many people in power still operate on the assumption that men should stay at work and women should be responsible for caregiving at home. They believe that a man who seeks time for caregiving is really just being lazy.\n\nSo from the day their kids are born, many dads don’t have as much time at home as they wanted to. And the overall gender pay gap—in which men much more often have higher-paying jobs—leave men working more and more hours for pay, while women do more at home. This isn’t what today’s dads and moms hoped for. It’s a vicious cycle.\n\nThe key is for us to break out of the cycle by fixing the problem on all three fronts. We need a national paid family leave insurance program, which is supported by the vast majority of the country, including majorities of Democrats and Republicans. It is not a requirement on businesses to pay people when they’re off. And it has proven great for business in the states that have it.\n\nBusinesses have financial incentive to offer paid family leave as well, since it attracts and retains employees amid a war for talent. In my work with companies, I show them how to construct these policies in ways proven to increase profits.\n\nAnd it’s time for all of us to stand up to the stigmas. We need to speak out, take legal action when necessary (as I did), and most importantly, communicate with each other about these challenges. The more we make the truth about today’s dads known, the faster the outdated structures will disintegrate.\n\nWhen we do that, we’ll make sure that the way today’s children envision themselves as parents has a bigger, better shot at coming to fruition.\n\nYou can follow Quora – the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world, on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. \n\nMore from Quora:\n\nWhat can men do to support women in the workplace and at home?

          "description": "After twelve years of reading and writing about money, I’ve come to love financial rules of thumb.\n\nFinancial rules of thumb provide helpful shortcuts for making quick calculations and decisions. You don’t always have time (or want to take the time) to create elaborate spreadsheets when choosing a course of action. In these cases, it’s nice to have some rough guidelines you can rely on.\n\nYou’ve probably heard of the “rule of 72”, for example. This shortcut says that if you divide 72 by a particular rate of return, you’ll get the number of years it’ll take to double your money. If your savings account yields 4%, say, it will take about 18 years for your nest egg to increase by 100%. But if you were able to earn 12% on your investment, that money would double in six years.\n\nLike all rules of thumb, the rule of 72 isn’t precise. It doesn’t give an exact answer but a ballpark figure. Financial rules of thumb don’t always hold true. But they’re true enough for us to make loose plans based on them.\n\nI have some engineer friends who’d get tense at this sort of sloppy guesswork, but most of the rest of us are happy to trade a bit of precision for speed. That’s what rules of thumb are all about!\n\nThe trick, of course, is knowing which rules of thumb to use. Most are handy, but some common guidelines do more harm than good.\n\nRules Gone Wild\n\nIn the past, you’ve probably seen my rant about some of my most-hated financial rules of thumb. Let’s look at three things I think conventional wisdom gets wrong (and what I believe are better alternatives).\n\nHow much should you save for retirement?\nFor instance, I get frustrated when I hear financial advisers push the idea that you should base your retirement savings on 70% of your income. Instead of estimating your retirement needs from your income, it makes far more sense to base them on spending. Your spending reflects your lifestyle; your income doesn’t.\n\nI think a better rule of thumb for determining retirement needs is this: When estimating how much you’ll need to save for retirement, assume you’ll spend as much in the future as you do now. Use 100% of your current expenses to calculate your retirement spending. (And if you want to build in a safety margin, base your future needs on 110% of your current spending.)\n\nHow much should you spend on a house?\nAs I mentioned last week, another rule of thumb that makes me cranky is this common guideline espoused by all sectors of the homebuying industry: “Buy as much home as you can afford.” No no no no no! Of all financial rules of thumb, this is probably the worst. It’s certainly one of the most prevalent. This is how folks end up house poor, chained to a mortgage they resent.\n\nLenders quantify this guideline by saying your housing payments should be nor more than 28% or 33% or 41% of your income. But, as David Bach wrote in The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner, “You should generally assume that the amount the bank or mortgage company is willing to loan you is more than you should borrow.” A better rule of thumb? Spend as little on housing as possible. Spending less than 25% of your net income is best — less than 20% is even better.\n\nHow much life insurance should you carry?\nA third rule that bugs me is the one for determining how much life insurance you should buy. Different experts give different answers. Some say your policy should cover five times your annual income. Others say ten times. And Suze Orman recommends 20 times annual income needs.\n\nThe truth is that not everyone needs life insurance. Like all insurance, it’s designed to prevent financial catastrophes. You only need it if other people — like a spouse or children — would face financial hardship when you die. If you don’t have kids, if your spouse has a good income, or you have substantial savings, then life insurance isn’t a necessity.\n\nEven if you do need life insurance, you probably don’t need to carry as much as your insurance agent is willing to sell you. To find out the amount that’s right for you, check out the Life Insurance Needs Calculator from the non-profit Life Happens organization. (How much life insurance should I carry? According to this calculator, I shouldn’t have any at all. And I don’t.)\n\nUseful Financial Rules of Thumb\n\nFinancial rules of thumb usually aren’t this bad. In fact, most are useful. Here are eighteen of my favorites.\n\nWhen estimating income, $1 an hour in wage is equivalent to $2000 per year in pre-tax earnings. The reverse is also true: $2000 per year in salary is equal to $1 an hour in hourly wage. (This rule works because the average worker spends roughly 2000 hours per year on the job.)\n\nHow wealthy should you be? According to the authors of The Millionaire Next Door, the following “wealth formula” can tell you if you’re on target: Divide your age by ten, then multiply by your annual gross income. Your net worth should be equal to this number (less any inheritances). So, if you’re 40 and make $50,000 per year, your net worth should be $200,000. If you have less than half the expected amount, you’re an “under-accumulator of wealth”. If you have twice the target, you’re a “prodigious accumulator of wealth”. (Note that the authors are well aware that this formula doesn’t work well for young people; it’s meant to be used by folks nearing retirement age.)\n\nOn average, each dollar an American spends represents about $2.50 of after-tax value in ten years or $10 in thirty years. (If you live outside the U.S., the consequences of spending that dollar are probably even greater.) This is due to two reasons: taxes and compounding. When you buy something, you spend after-tax dollars. On average, Americans have to earn $1.33 to have $1.00 left over.\n\nInflation is the silent killer of wealth. In the U.S., inflation has averaged 3.18% over the past hundred years. A lot of folks figure a 3% inflation rate when making money calculations. I think it’s safer to assume 3.5% — or even 4% — average inflation in the future.\n\nHistorically, U.S. stocks have earned long-term real returns (meaning inflation-adjusted returns) of about 7%. Bonds have long-term real returns of around 2.5%. Gold and real estate have long-term real returns of close to 1%.\n\nIf you withdraw about four percent of your savings each year, your wealth snowball will maintain its value against inflation. During market downturns, you might have to withdraw as little as three percent. If times are flush, you might allow yourself five percent. But four percent is generally safe. (For more on safe withdrawal rates, check out this article from the Mad Fientist.)\n\nBased on the previous rule of thumb, there’s a quick way to check whether early retirement is within your reach. Multiply your current annual expenses by 25. If the result is less than your savings, you’ve achieved financial independence — you can retire early. If the product is greater than your savings, you still have work to do. (If you’re conservative or have low risk tolerance, multiply your annual expenses by 30. If you’re aggressive and/or willing to take on greater risk, multiple by 20.)\n\nBuilding on the above, Mr. Money Mustache’s shockingly simple math behind early retirement gives us a useful rule of thumb for determining how long you’ll need to save before you’re financially independent. Figure out your current saving rate (or profit margin, if you prefer). Subtract this number from 60. Roughly speaking — and assuming you’ve started from a zero net worth — that’s how long you’ll need to work before your nest egg is big enough to support you in retirement. (Note that this rule breaks down at saving rates over 40%. If you save a lot, subtract from 70.)\n\nJoe from Stacking Benjamins likes what he calls the “penny approximation”: Assuming a safe withdraw rate of roughly four percent, every $100 you save gives you one penny per day in perpetuity. Once you stack enough Benjamins you have enough pennies to sustain you forever. If you change your own brake pads and save $200, thats two cents a day for the rest of your life because you avoided paying a mechanic.\n\nI hate detailed budgets because they bog people down. Instead, I’m a fan of budget frameworks that focus more on the Big Picture. My favorite budget framework is the Balanced Money Formula: Spend no more than 50% of your after-tax income on Needs, put at least 20% into savings (including debt reduction), and spend the rest (around 30%) on Wants. This is a great beginner budget, but it’s also useful for transitioning to the mindset of Financial Independence. If you decide early retirement is a goal, then part of your Wants spending becomes additional savings.\n\nIf you own your home, it’s wise to set aside money for maintenance and repairs. Each year, contribute 1% of your home’s current value to a separate account. If you don’t spend the money, keep it there for future remodeling and improvements.\n\nIs it better to buy or to rent? The price-to-rent ratio is a useful rule of thumb for making this decision. Find two similar places, one for sale and one for rent. Divide the sale price of the one by the annual rent for the other. The result is the P/R ratio. Say you find a $200,000 house for sale in a nice neighborhood, and a similar home for rent on the next block for $1000 per month, which is $12,000 per year. Dividing $200,000 by $12,000, you get a P/R ratio of 16.7. If the P/R ratio is low, it’s better to buy. If the price-to-rent ratio is over 15, it’s probably better to rent.\n\nHow much does it cost to raise a child? As a rule of thumb, budget $10,000 per child per year. That’s not quite a quarter of a million dollars per kid, but it’s close.\n\nIf you get a windfall, use 1% to treat yourself. (Or maybe 2%, tops.) Put the rest in a safe place and ignore it for six months. After you’ve had time to think about it, then take action. So, if you inherit $100,000 from Aunt Marge, only allow yourself a $1000 splurge. Stash the remaining $99,000 someplace you won’t be tempted to spend it.\n\nTo approximate a new vehicle’s five-year cost of ownership (in monthly terms), double the price tage and divide by 60. Looking at a brand-new Mini Cooper ? Double that $30,000 sticker price to get $60,000, then divide by 60. Is it really worth $1000 per month to get rid of your crummy Ford Focus?\n\nThe standard rule of thumb is to save at least 10% of your income. I think a better goal is to aim for 20% — and more is better. Financial guru Liz Weston says that if you’re young, you should follow this guideline: “Save 10% for basics, 15% for comfort, 20% to escape.”\n\nNobody agrees how much you should set aside for an emergency fund. Even the experts offer advice ranging from $1000 up to 12 months of expenses. (The most common suggestions range from three to six months of expenses.) One clever rule of thumb to determine how much you should have set aside: Your emergency fund should cover X months of expenses, where X is the current unemployment rate. In other words, because the U.S. unemployment is about 4% right now, you should aim to have enough money in the bank to cover four months of expenses.\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, wen you’re faced with the repair of an appliance (such as a refrigerator or washing machine), you should buy a new one if the appliance is more than eight years old (or if the repair would cost more than half what it would take to buy a replacement).\n\nIt’s important to remember that rules of thumb aren’t set in stone. They’re guidelines. They’re meant to help you make quick evaluations, not actual life-changing decisions. Financial rules of thumb are a starting point. Start with them, then adjust for your individual goals and situation.\n\nOther Useful Financial Guidelines\n\nStrictly speaking, rules of thumb deal with numbers. Still, there are a lot of non-numeric guidelines that I think are useful to know. If you’ve done any reading about personal finance, for example, you’ve probably heard the admonition, “Pay yourself first.” While not strictly a rule of thumb, this guideline is very similar.\n\nHere are some other useful financial guidelines:\n\nThe more you learn, the more you earn. In the U.S., education has a greater impact on work-life earnings than any other demographic factor. Your age, race, gender, and location all influence what you earn, but nothing matters more than what you know.\n\nBank a raise. When you get a salary bump, don’t increase your spending. Stay the course and put the added income into savings.\n\nAlways take the employer match on the 401(k).\n\nNever touch your retirement savings — except for retirement.\n\nNever co-sign on a loan. (Ever.)\n\nAvoid paying interest on anything that loses value. It’s okay to finance a home or a college education but avoid taking out a loan on a car.\n\nSpeaking of cars: When you buy a vehicle, buy used or buy new and plan to drive it for at least ten years. (Do both and you’ll save even more!)\n\nDon’t mess with the IRS. When it comes to taxes, don’t try to cheat. Pay what you owe. Claim all the deductions you deserve, but don’t try to stretch things.\n\nIn general, save an emergency fund first; pay off high-interest debt second; and begin investing (at the same time you pay down remaining debt) last.\n\nIt almost always makes more sense (and cents) to repair your old car than to buy a new one.\n\nIf you’re not willing to pay cash for it, then it doesn’t make sense to buy it on credit. (I have a friend whose guiding principle is: “If I wouldn’t buy five, why would I buy one?” Similar idea taken to an extreme.)\n\nSave for your own retirement before saving for your children’s college education. They can get loans for school. You can’t get loans for retirement.\n\nNow it’s your turn. What rules of thumb did I miss? Do you disagree with any of those I suggested? What are some of your favorite rules of thumb?\n\nThe post 18 favorite financial rules of thumb (and some useful money guidelines) appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",

          "description": "To celebrate Mother’s Day, Quartz staff collected story ideas from their mothers and sought to answer them. This mother asks: How do Americans experience going back to work after maternity leave? Read more stories from the series here.\n\nFor women in countries that offer several weeks or months of paid maternity leave, it can be unfathomable to think about returning to work only a week or even days after giving birth. But for many American women, it’s an everyday reality.\n\nThe US is the only rich nation in the world that doesn’t require companies to offer their employees paid maternity leave. Only 14% of US civilian workers in 2016 had access to paid family leave in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. One in four US mothers return to work 10 days after giving birth. And just over one-third of American mothers don’t return to work (pdf) after having a baby. (The economic losses of not having paid family leave are significant.)\n\nQuartz asked American women to describe their experience of going back to work after giving birth. Some were lucky to have flexible schedules and found fulfillment in going back to work; others struggled with unreliable child care, unsupportive bosses, health problems, and anxiety. Here are their stories (slightly edited for clarity and length).\n\nShannon, 52, talent development\nDuration of leave: seven weeks to three months for three kids \n\nThe hardest was returning after a four-year leave. I used the time well with education, consulting, leading parts in the community. Yet my resume was a lead balloon. I ended up in a different profession via referral by a friend. It took a few years to get back. I felt handicapped yet wasn’t, but couldn’t shake the stigma.\n\nClaudia, 43, journalist\nFive months\n\n “One advantage of being an older mother is that I am in a position financially to make that choice. Others are not so fortunate.” My boss let me work from home and start at three days a week, so I was lucky compared to most American parents. However, I was not ready to leave my son when he was still so small and ended up quitting a few months later. One advantage of being an older mother is that I am in a position financially to make that choice. Others are not so fortunate, especially earlier in their careers.\n\nAmanda, 38, lawyer\nFive months\n\nIt was challenging finding a good nanny who we trusted and felt comfortable leaving our son with—and it was hard to leave him in someone else’s hands all day long—but it was also somewhat of a relief to go back to work. It turns out working full-time is in many ways much easier than taking care of a baby full-time! But I wish I had eased back in a bit more.\n\nI actually find it to be more difficult now that my son is three and has so much personality, so much to say, and feelings about things. In retrospect, a little baby is relatively easy to leave in the morning and come home to at night. I would love to spend more time with my three-year-old each day.\n\nSara, 32, digital communications\nTwelve weeks (four parental leave, two accrued paid time off, six unpaid)\n\nI was incredibly lucky in that I was the first woman to be pregnant at my company. I negotiated a ramp-up period where I started at 24 hours a week, including one day from home, then bumped up to 32 hours per week with two days from home. It allowed me to transition gently and set a reasonable expectation for my ability to fulfill my job function. That said, money was very tight from being on one income for so long and then a part-time income. I definitely missed out on opportunities because I wasn’t easily able to travel for client meetings.\n\nTia, 37, journalist\nThree months, broken up into two six-week stints\n\nMy first pregnancy I went back after six weeks; I was depressed and this helped me dig out of it, plus I was a contractor with no paid benefits. This time (my third child), I went back after six weeks, went on to leave again at three months, then back again at four and a half months. It was hectic but I hate not being at work. What I really hate is how I had three different layers of bureaucracy to navigate in order to utilize any paid leave. I had six weeks of paid bonding leave through San Francisco, six weeks of disability through California, and my company covered the same six weeks of disability at a lower level—so they pitched in nothing rather than pushing me up to full pay.\n\nMelissa, 27, nurse practitioner\nFifteen weeks\n\n “Sometimes I feel like my milk supply suffers when I work more than one day in a row and that can be really stressful.” I work three days during the week, and every third weekend. Having the days off during the week with the baby really helps with the adjustment. My husband is also on paternity leave now, so I know my baby is in great hands. It will be harder in a month when he starts at a home daycare. Sometimes I feel like my milk supply suffers when I work more than one day in a row and that can be really stressful.\n\nAllison, 31, administrative assistant\nEight weeks, but extended to nine\n\nI was a restaurant manager then. It was horrible. There was obvious guilt of leaving your kiddo so young. And the normal issues: pumping and postpartum depression. I would tell my boss that I needed to go pump, and he would yell at me that it wasn’t a good time and he didn’t have to provide time for me if it inconvenienced the company’s day-to-day. I really didn’t choose when I needed to pump, your body tells you. Needless to say, I dried up quickly and before I was ready.\n\nWe had issues finding affordable child care. We had one babysitter leave my son (six months at the time) in a running car for hours.  She’s lucky we didn’t press charges.\n\nAfter returning to work, I would go days without seeing my son because I would leave for the restaurant before he got up, then would get home after he had gone to bed. Ultimately I was forced out, and it was a good thing.\n\nNobody tells you how hard it is to be a first-time mom, with hormones, with baby, and then with the government’s “policies,” and then the stigma of society and working mothers. It’s just unbelievable, yet we do it. And we do it with grace and a BAMF Mommy attitude.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is an outspoken advocate for paid family leave. (Reuters/Sam Goresh)\nSophie, 33, database migration and management\nTen weeks\n\nIt was hard. I had a flexible schedule, and daycare was close by, so I was still able to breastfeed the way I wanted to. But about two weeks after I went back to work, my daughter got sick. It started as a respiratory virus, and then turned into full-blown pneumonia, which left her struggling to breathe. She was admitted to the hospital, and I worked from her hospital room with my laptop, taking care of emails while nurses checked her oxygen levels and dosed her with antibiotics. I’m planning on taking more unpaid leave [for my next child], so hopefully this baby will be bigger before going into daycare, but it weighs on me a lot.\n\nKathleen, 27, human resources coordinator\nEleven weeks\n\nI had a good experience. We love our son’s daycare, which is only four minutes from my office. I would nurse him on my lunch hour—this helped break up my time away from him. I did miss out on the office camaraderie because of missing lunches and having to take pumping breaks, but now he is one year old, and I get good adult conversation over lunch!\n\nMy employer is also extremely flexible with hours and work from home which makes it less stressful. We also have a doctor that does wellness visits on weekends and evenings so I haven’t had to miss work for that.\n\nJessica, 25, finance\nSix weeks\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind was how sad and overwhelmed I was. I even felt like a failure having to leave my child so early. I had negative thoughts every day from knowing I was failing at providing breast milk to not spending enough time bonding with my child. I wish I had more time to bond and understand my new life as a mother.\n\nCoty, 34, lawyer at a non-profit\nThree months\n\nI had a really hard maternity leave—a premature baby who got sick a lot—and expected to dread going back to work because that is the predominant societal narrative. But I have actually loved it. As soon as I picked up my son from daycare the first time and saw that he was okay, I relaxed. I’ve been back in the office for three and a half months now. Of course I miss my baby.  But I get to use my brain and talk to adults and if I want to go grab a sandwich for lunch, I can do that without having to pack a diaper bag.\n\n “I have made an effort to talk about how happy I am to be back at work to friends and coworkers in an effort to dispel some of the ‘every mother secretly wants to be at home with the baby’ stereotype.” It has definitely made a big difference that I have an office of my own with privacy to pump, and a supportive workplace that allows me to continue doing so. It’s a constant juggling act, but being back at work has made me a better parent. When I am with my son, I am grateful to be with him and not dreading the long expanse of day to fill. And when he’s at daycare and I’m at work, I know that he’s safe and learning. I have made an effort to talk about how happy I am to be back at work to friends and coworkers in an effort to dispel some of the “every mother secretly wants to be at home with the baby” stereotype.\n\nErin, 32, technology\nSixteen weeks\n\nTo be honest, it was quite positive. My company provided 16 weeks paid and at the end of it I felt excited to return to work. The transition back was, as expected, an adjustment at first, but my team and family were both supportive which made a huge difference. I’m due with baby number two in November and feel very optimistic about the process being just as smooth.\n\nMargo, 35, digital marketing specialist\nThree months\n\nA full nightmare. An actual waking nightmare. My daughter had feeding and weight issues that we were still trying to sort out. (It turned out she was pooping blood because she was allergic to both dairy and soy. What a fun mystery to solve that was!) I hadn’t yet had a full night of sleep and wouldn’t for months and months after, because she didn’t sleep through the night until after she was one.\n\nI don’t know how I did it, and I’m one of the lucky ones. I cobbled together 10 weeks paid and only had to take two unpaid. It honestly humbled me to my core and made me militant in my belief that all new parents need at least six months paid, minimum.\n\nOnly 14% of US civilian workers in 2016 had access to paid family leave, according to the Pew Research Center. (Reuters/Joshua Lott)\nLindsay, 36, certified public accountant\nEleven weeks\n\nMy experience has been positive. I am able to set my own pump schedule and have a clean, nice space to do it. I am able to shift my hours to leave on time to get my baby from daycare. I can work from home when I need to. I can go to all baby appointments as needed without penalizing my paid time off. My only criticism is I wish I received my full paycheck while I was out, rather than the 60% my short-term disability provided.\n\nMelinda, 37, early intervention program manager\nTwelve weeks unpaid\n\nI could only go back part time due to my infant’s needs and my own health issues. It was extremely difficult to find quality and affordable care, pump enough milk for him to be fed when I wasn’t there, but also impossible to pay the bills without my job. And it feels terrible to not be able to rest and enjoy your baby, and to go back to work when you’re still barely getting any sleep. I am thankful my employer was flexible and understanding, otherwise it would have been impossible, not just hard! This is a big part of the reason I only have one child.\n\nAshley, 28, teacher\nSix weeks\n\n “It honestly humbled me to my core and made me militant in my belief that all new parents need at least six months paid, minimum.” It was hard leaving my newborn daughter with someone that I had only recently met. It’s even more difficult finding adequate time to pump and the stress of producing enough is at times unbearable. My workplace is more than accommodating, but being a teacher makes it difficult to leave the students during class not knowing if they’re getting the help that they need, let alone knowing that their behavior changes when I’m not there. It’s a catch-22: I love my job. But I miss my daughter.\n\nCynthia, nonprofit\nEleven and a half weeks\n\nTwo kids at two different jobs. Both unpaid. I was a wreck after my first—colic, no sleep, came back to a giant pile of work and pumping accommodations that maybe just barely met the law. Wasn’t covered by FMLA [the Family and Medical Leave Act] with the second, was warned I could be fired and advised to take an even shorter leave. [At the second job] my department and coworkers were much more supportive, though. They had pumping space and no one seemed mad when I took time with my baby on leave or to pump.\n\nAnnalyn, 25, mammographer\nEight weeks \n\nI’m a first-time mom and I knew I would miss my child but didn’t know it was going to be as difficult as it turned out to be. My heart ached everyday and still does even with her at seven months old. As much as I would love to be home with her, I always think about how hard I worked for my degree and how fulfilling my job is. I sometimes feel selfish for thinking that, but I’m so damn proud of what I’ve accomplished career-wise that I can’t give that up, at least just yet. I wish we could stay home with our babies for more than the 12 weeks some employers allow (if you’re eligible for FMLA that is), because there’s so much growth and self-discovery that our babies go through that we miss out on.\n\nJenn, 30, teacher\nFive months\n\n “I wish I had more time to bond and understand my new life as a mother.” I work for a super-awesome, alternative-options, year-round high school program. I had five months paid time off while working from home 15-20 hours a week to extend it as long as possible. All my coworkers are very supportive of breastfeeding and understood when I had to pump, as most of them have kids.\n\nSusan, 35, nanny\nFour weeks\n\nI told my boss I’d need “at least a month” off before coming back to work. [It would be] unpaid, so I really couldn’t afford any longer. He interpreted that to mean four weeks and scheduled me to be back 28 days after my baby was born. Somehow I felt like 30 or 31 days (a whole month!) would have made a difference, but I guess not much in the end. I’m lucky though, I get to bring my baby with me [to work] and I can breastfeed whenever I need to.\n\nJennifer, 43, content editor\nTwelve weeks\n\n[It was] disorienting. I was grateful to be back in a more familiar element, but I was sleep-deprived and had a hard time catching up. At three months, my baby still wasn’t sleeping through the night, so we were waking up every three hours (or less) to her cries. And while my work had a lactation room for nursing mothers to pump, it was windowless, dark, and depressing. Plus, since I was having a hard time producing milk, I would always take longer than I had planned for, which would eat into the time I needed to spend catching up on work. So I ended up giving up on breastfeeding less than a month after I had returned to work. I don’t know how women do it with even shorter maternity leaves.\n\nSheena, 38, software engineer\nFour and a half months\n\nIt was hard. My project had been taken over by someone else and all the other good projects were snapped up also. I lost a lot of momentum and it took me a year to get it back. And I was pregnant again, so I lost the opportunity to see my project through.\n\nGail, 41, chef\nFour months\n\nIt was complicated. A part of me was ready to work again, and another part of me knew I was missing out on being with my baby. For my last child, I had started a family business, so when I went back to work, she went with me. A niece met me at job sites where I worked making the food. She would hold my baby on site while I worked and bring her to me when it was time to nurse. After a few months of that, she went to day care with her brother and sister. I had to give her formula then, another decision that was complicated for me. I always thought I would be a stay at home mom, but it turns out I am not.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

          "description": "We know that babies prefer the high-pitched sounds produced by their caregivers in “baby talk” over regular speech, but a new study provides an exciting new perspective. At five months of age, it seems that babies prefer to listen to the sounds of their peers to the cooing of their mother. \n\nResearchers at the University of Quebec tested babies on their preference for different speakers by using a specialized speech synthesizer. They were able to simulate the effects of the human vocal tract—the vocal cords, tongue and mouth—to create vowels with differing pitch and resonance, representing vowels produced by vocal tracts of different sizes. \n\nThe apparatus let the researchers compare babies’ responses to vowels produced by infants their own age, as well as vowels typical of an adult female’s speech. They tested the babies’ responses to different vowel sounds by training them to look towards or away from a chequerboard image. Simply by turning their heads, the babies indicated which sounds they preferred. \n\nThe results were striking. Five-month-olds listened to the infant vowels for 40% longer than the adult vowels, showing a clear preference for vowels that closely matched the sounds they produce themselves. \n\nThese findings present a new view on how we think about babies’ early language learning. A lot of existing research focuses on the effect of parents’ speech on language development; for example, how words produced in a higher pitch grab babies’ attention more easily and go on to shape their early vocabulary. And there is no denying that baby talk is important in child development. Babies who hear more high-pitched baby talk from their caregivers have larger vocabularies at two years of age and higher IQs at age seven. \n\nBabble teaches babies to talk\n\nBut while babies prefer to listen to adult speech when it is produced at a higher pitch, a preference for infant vocalizations over and above this might have important implications for very early language learning. Authors of the study propose that it might motivate them to vocalize more in the first months of life, which could promote the transition to babble production just a few months later. \n\nBabble is the emergence of repeated language-like syllables consisting of one or two “favorite” consonants, such as “bababa.” And we now know that it is an important indication of later language ability. Earlier onset of stable babbling leads to earlier word production and a larger vocabulary in the first two years of life. With this in mind, babies’ implicit preference for their own vocalizations could be an important factor in their path to full language use.\n\nThis is not the first study to suggest that infants’ own vocalizations may play an important role in language learning. Perception of consonants produced in their own babble may help infants filter the speech stream into something more manageable. \n\nStudies have shown that infants prefer to listen to words that match the sounds produced in their babble. For example, an infant who produces many “bababa” sounds will prefer made-up words containing “b,” such as “bapeb,” “pabep” and “pobep”. This is similar to the “cocktail-party effect,” where even in a noisy room we can pick out words that are more relevant to us, such as our name or the town where we live. \n\nIn the same way, infants’ attention is drawn to words that match the sounds they produce most often, helping them pick out words from the speech stream that they’re more likely to be able to produce. It’s no coincidence that infants’ very first words have babble-like qualities: “mummy,” “daddy,” “baby” and onomatopoeic words such as “baa baa” and “woof woof.”\n\nThe importance of infants’ perception of their own vocalizations is supported by research into babies who are deaf. Studies of deaf babies have shown that they do babble but they start babbling much later than hearing infants. \n\nWithout feedback on their own babble production, deaf infants typically cease to babble after a few months. These studies have allowed us to piece together a more comprehensive picture of how human language emerges, taking into account the importance of infant vocalization long before they produce their first word. \n\nBabies learn from the adult world around them, but they also learn from their own early vocalizations. These new findings suggest that this begins much earlier than we previously thought. Perhaps language production does not start with words or even babble, but with vocalizations that begin long before the first speech-like sounds are produced.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

          "description": "The Muslim holy month of Ramadan starts on Tuesday, May 15, and most of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims will be observing it. This means there's a good chance you might encounter someone — a friend, a coworker, the barista making your latte at Starbucks, your child's teacher — who will be celebrating, fasting, and doing all sorts of other activities that are unique to the holy month.\n\nBut what is Ramadan, exactly? And how can I make sure I don't accidentally offend my Muslim friends and acquaintances during Ramadan celebrations?\n\nWe've got you covered: Here are the most basic answers to the most basic questions about Ramadan.\n\n1) What is Ramadan actually about?\n\nRamadan is the most sacred month of the year for Muslims — the Prophet Mohammed reportedly said, \"When the month of Ramadan starts, the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are chained.\"\n\nMuslims believe it was during this month that God revealed the first verses of the Quran, Islam's sacred text, to Mohammed, on a night known as \"The Night of Power\" (or Laylat al-Qadr in Arabic).\n\nDuring the entire month of Ramadan, Muslims fast every day from dawn to sunset. It is meant to be a time of spiritual discipline — of deep contemplation of one's relationship with God, extra prayer, increased charity and generosity, and intense study of the Quran.\n\nBut if that makes it sound super serious and boring, it's really not. It's a time of celebration and joy, to be spent with loved ones. At the end of Ramadan there is a big three-day celebration called Eid al-Fitr, or \"the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast.\" It's kind of like the Muslim version of Christmas, in the sense that it's a religious holiday where everyone comes together for big meals with family and friends, exchanges presents, and generally has a lovely time.\n\n        Eid presents!!!\n\n        Cem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nDespite the hardship of fasting for a whole month, most Muslims (myself included) actually look forward to Ramadan and are a little sad when it's over. There's just something really special about knowing that tens of millions of your fellow Muslims around the world are experiencing the same hunger pangs, dry mouth, and dizzy spells that you are, and that we're all in it together.\n\n2) How does fasting work?\n\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars — or duties — of Islam, along with the testimony of faith, prayer, charitable giving, and making pilgrimage to Mecca. All Muslims are required to take part every year, though there are special dispensations for those who are ill, pregnant or nursing, menstruating, or traveling, and for young children and the elderly.\n\nThe practice of fasting serves several spiritual and social purposes: to remind you of your human frailty and your dependence on God for sustenance, to show you what it feels like to be hungry and thirsty so you feel compassion for (and a duty to help) the poor and needy, and to reduce the distractions in life so you can more clearly focus on your relationship with God.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating any food, drinking any liquids, smoking cigarettes, and engaging in any sexual activity, from dawn to sunset. That includes taking medication (even if you swallow a pill dry, without drinking any water). Chewing gum is also prohibited (though I didn't find that one out until about halfway through my first Ramadan after converting — oops).\n\nDoing any of those things \"invalidates\" your fast for the day, and you just start over the next day. To make up for days you didn't fast, you can either fast later in the year (either all at once or a day here and there) or provide a meal to a needy person for each day you missed.\n\nMuslims are also supposed to try to curb negative thoughts and emotions like jealousy and anger, and even lesser things like swearing, complaining, and gossiping, during the month. Some people may also choose to give up or limit activities like listening to music and watching television, often in favor of listening to recitations of the Quran.\n\n3) What is a typical day like during Ramadan?\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims wake up well before dawn to eat the first meal of the day, which has to last until sunset. This means eating lots of high-protein foods and drinking as much water as possible right up until dawn, after which you can't eat or drink anything. At dawn, we perform the morning prayer. Since it's usually still pretty early, many go back to sleep for a bit before waking up again to get ready for the day (I certainly do).\n\nMuslims are not supposed to avoid work or school or any other normal duties during the day just because we are fasting. In many Muslim countries, however, businesses and schools may reduce their hours during the day or close entirely. For the most part, though, Muslims go about their daily business as we normally would, despite not being able to eat or drink anything the whole day.\n\nWhen the evening call to prayer is finally made (or when the alarm on your phone's Muslim prayer app goes off), we break the day's fast with a light meal — really more of a snack — called an iftar (literally \"breakfast\"), before performing the evening prayer. Many also go to the mosque for the evening prayer, followed by a special prayer that is only recited during Ramadan.\n\nThis is usually followed by a larger meal a bit later in the evening, which is often shared with family and friends in one another's homes throughout the month. Then it's off to bed for a few hours of sleep before it's time to wake up and start all over again.\n\n(Note: There are good reasons for only having a small snack to break your fast before performing the evening prayer and then eating a bigger meal later. Muslim prayers involve a lot of movement — bending over, prostrating on the ground, standing up, etc. Doing all that physical activity on a full stomach after not having eaten for 15 hours is a recipe for disaster. Just trust me on this one.)\n\n4) So do you lose weight during Ramadan?\n\nSome of you may be thinking, \"Wow, that sounds like a great way to lose weight! I'm going to try it!\" But in fact, Ramadan is actually notorious for often causing weight gain. That's because eating large meals super early in the morning and late at night with a long period of low activity bordering on lethargy in between can wreak havoc on your metabolism.\n\nBut if you're careful, you can avoid putting on weight, and you may actually lose a few pounds. One meta-analysis of scientific studies on the effects of Ramadan fasting on body weight found that \"[w]eight changes during Ramadan were relatively small and mostly reversed after Ramadan, gradually returning to pre-Ramadan status. Ramadan provides an opportunity to lose weight, but structured and consistent lifestyle modifications are necessary to achieve lasting weight loss.\" [Italics mine.]\n\nSo just like with any other extreme diet plan, you may lose a few pounds, but unless you actually make \"structured and consistent lifestyle modifications,\" you're probably not going to see major, lasting results.\n\n5) Why do the dates of Ramadan change every year?\n\nFor religious matters, Muslims follow a lunar calendar — that is, one based on the phases of the moon — whose 12 months add up to approximately 354 days. That's 11 days shorter than the 365 days of the standard Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the Islamic lunar calendar moves backward approximately 11 days each year in relation to the regular Gregorian calendar.\n\nSo that means that the first day of the month of Ramadan, which is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, moves backward by about 11 days each year.\n\nThis has a large impact on how people experience Ramadan from year to year. When Ramadan falls in the winter, it's much easier to fast: the days are shorter, which means you don't have to fast as long, and it's colder out, so not being able to drink water all day isn't as big of a deal, because you're not sweating as much.\n\nConversely, when Ramadan falls in the summer (as it has every year since I converted, because of course), fasting can be brutal. In many Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, summer temperatures can reach levels usually reserved for the deepest bowels of hell.\n\nAnd in some northern European countries such as Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (where, yes, there are Muslims), fasting can last an average of 20 hours or more in the summer. (And in a few places above the Arctic Circle, the sun never actually sets in the summer. In these cases, Muslim religious authorities have decreed that Muslims can either fast along with the closest Muslim country or fast along with Mecca, Saudi Arabia.)\n\n6) Okay, but why is there always confusion every year about exactly what day Ramadan starts on?\n\nThere's a reason \"Ramadan start date\" is one of the most-searched phrases every single year. That's because Muslims around the world do not know when exactly Ramadan is actually supposed to start. If you Google it, you'll see there's a little disclaimer under Google's answer that says \"Dates may vary\":\n\nThat also has to do with the moon — as well as disagreements about science, history, and tradition, plus a bit of geopolitical rivalry.\n\nThe beginning of each new month in the Islamic calendar starts on the new moon. Which means the month of Ramadan starts on the new moon. Simple enough, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIf it's been a while since your high school astronomy class, here's a reminder of what the phases of the moon look like:\n\n        Pictured: the source of much consternation and hilarity every single Ramadan.\n\n        Griffith Observatory\n\nBack in Mohammed's day, in sixth-century Arabia, astronomical calculations weren't as precise as they are today, so people went by what they could see with the naked eye.\n\nSince the new moon isn't actually super visible in the night sky (as you can see above), Muslims traditionally waited to start fasting until the small sliver of crescent moon became visible. There's even a saying attributed to the Prophet Mohammed about waiting to start the fast until you see the crescent. (Some people think this is why the star and crescent is the symbol of Islam, but the crescent was used as a symbol long before Islam.)\n\nThis method was a bit messy, though, since things like clouds or just the difficulty of spotting the moon in some locations often led to different groups starting their fast on separate days, even within the same country. Each community, village, or even mosque within the village might send its own guy out to look for the crescent, with rival groups arguing over whether the other guy really saw it or not.\n\nToday, however, we have precise scientific calculations that tell us exactly when the new moon begins, and we don't need to wait until someone spots a tiny crescent in the sky. (In fact, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, \"The need to determine the precise appearance of the hilal [crescent moon] was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy.\")\n\nSo, problem solved! Except that some Muslim scholars believe we should still wait until the slight crescent moon is visible in the night sky, because that's what Mohammed said to do and that's the way we've always done it.\n\nOthers argue that Islam has a strong tradition of reason, knowledge, and science, and that if Mohammed were around today he'd choose the more precise scientific calculations over sending the guy at the mosque with the best eyesight outside to squint at the night sky.\n\nTo make things even more fun, some argue that the whole world should just follow the official moon-sighting decrees of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the location of its holiest sites. But not everyone thinks that's such a swell idea — especially rival countries like Pakistan and Iran, which balk at the idea of treating Saudi Arabia as the ultimate authority on anything having to do with Islam.\n\nAll this means that each year Muslims around the world get to experience the delightful lunacy of \"moon-sighting fighting.\" Indeed, it's such a familiar feature of Ramadan that there are memes about it:\n\n        Yes, Muslims use this meme too. There's really no escaping it.\n\n7) Are there differences between how Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims observe Ramadan?\n\nFor the most part, no. Both Sunni and Shia Muslims fast during Ramadan. But there are some minor differences — for instance, Sunnis break their daily fast at sunset, when the sun is no longer visible on the horizon (but there's still light in the sky), whereas Shia wait until the redness of the setting sun has completely vanished and the sky is totally dark.\n\nShia also celebrate an additional holiday within the month of Ramadan that Sunnis do not. For three days — the 19th, 20th, and 21st days of Ramadan — Shia commemorate the martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed who was both the revered fourth caliph of Sunni Islam and the first \"legitimate\" imam (leader) of Shia Islam.\n\nAli was assassinated in the fierce civil wars that erupted following the death of Mohammed over who should lead the Muslim community in his stead. On the 19th day of the month of Ramadan, while Ali was worshipping at a mosque in Kufa, Iraq, an assassin from a group of rebels who opposed his leadership fatally struck him with a poisoned sword. Ali died two days later.\n\nAli is a hugely important figure in Shia Islam. His tomb in nearby Najaf, Iraq, is the third-holiest site in Shia Islam, and millions of Shia make pilgrimage there every year. Although Sunnis revere Ali as one of the four \"rightly guided\" caliphs who ruled after Mohammed's death, they do not commemorate his death or make pilgrimage to his tomb.\n\n        The tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib in Najaf, Iraq.\n\n        Toushiro, public domain\n\n8) What can I do to be respectful of my Muslim friends during Ramadan?\n\nIn some Muslim countries, it is a crime to eat and drink in public during the day in the month of Ramadan, even if you're not Muslim.\n\nOf course, this is not the case in the United States, where we enjoy freedom of (and freedom from) religion. And most American Muslims, myself included, don't expect the non-Muslims around us to radically change their behavior to accommodate our religious fast during Ramadan.\n\nI've had friends and coworkers who have chosen to fast along with me out of solidarity (or just because it seems \"fun\"), and that was sweet of them, but it's not something I ever expected people to do. (Plus, they usually last about four days before they decide solidarity is overrated and being thirsty for 15 hours is not even remotely \"fun.\")\n\nAll that said, there are things you can do — and not do — to make things a little easier for friends or colleagues who happen to be fasting for Ramadan. If you share an office with someone fasting, maybe eat your delicious, juicy cheeseburger in the office break room rather than at your desk, where your poor, suffering Muslim coworkers will have to smell it and salivate (if they even have enough moisture left in their bodies to salivate at that point).\n\nTry to remember not to offer them a bite or a sip of what you're eating, because it's sometimes hard for us to remember that we're fasting and easy to absentmindedly accept and eat that Lay's potato chip you just offered us. But if you do, it's okay. We're not going to get mad or be offended (unless you're doing it on purpose, in which case, what is wrong with you?).\n\nIf you're having a dinner party and you want to invite your Muslim friends, try to schedule it after sunset so they can eat. Muslims don't drink alcohol or eat pork, but we usually don't mind being around it. (Contrary to popular belief, we are not scared of or allergic to pork; we just don't eat it. It's not like we're vampires and pork is garlic.) But do let us know if there's alcohol or pork in something so we don't accidentally eat it.\n\nIf you want to wish your Muslim friends or acquaintances a happy Ramadan or happy Eid al-Fitr, you're welcome to just say, \"Happy Ramadan!\" or \"Happy Eid!\" That's not offensive or anything. But if you want to show them you made an effort to learn more about their religion, the standard greetings are \"Ramadan/Eid kareem\" (which means \"have a generous Ramadan/Eid\") or \"Ramadan/Eid mubarak\" (which means \"have a blessed Ramadan/Eid\").\n\nEven something as simple as learning one of those expressions and saying it with a smile to your Muslim friends will go a long way toward making them feel comfortable and welcome.\n\n9) So if you're not supposed to get angry or complain or gossip during Ramadan, how come terrorist attacks by groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda always seem to spike during Ramadan?\n\nBecause terrorists are assholes.\n\nWatch: Muhammad Ali's biggest fights were outside the ring\n",

          "description": "Taxi Cab Owners and Regulators Created Uber\nThe number of cars for hire didn’t rise with demand. What would you expect?\nBloomberg, May 4, 2018\n\n \n\n \n\nOn this day May 4, 2011, Uber NYC launched. It filled an enormous, artificial void that was created by the Taxi and Limousine Commission at the behest of the Yellow Cab medallion owners.\n\nIn New York, Uber has been thrust back into the news after several Yellow Cab driver suicides (read this or listen to this) and indebtedness and families of survivors are blaming the stress of competing with smartphone ride-hailing services. The New York City Council is looking to limit or perhaps even reverse the expansion of app-based rides.\n\nThis is a terrible idea.\n\nThis is because it was market forces — plain, pure and simple — that created the demand for ride services like Uber, Lyft and others. 1 Indeed, these companies might not have achieved the wild success they found in New York but for the combination of the TLC’s aggressive incompetence and the medallion owners’ unbridled greed. Since the 1970s, these two groups have made taxi service in New York abysmal while enriching themselves. They did this by keeping the number of taxi medallions at an artificially low number and ignoring demand, much to the eternal dismay of anyone trying to hail a cab.\n\nA little history: The TLC was created in 1971 to “wrest control of taxi industry regulation away from the [New York City] Police Department,” according to Biju Mathew, 2 author of “Taxi!: Cabs and Capitalism in New York City.” This change took curbside ride-hailing from bad to worse and the TLC began a rich epoch of corruption and failure, marked by indictments and convictions.\n\n \n\nContinues at: Taxi Cab Owners and Regulators Created Uber\n\n \n",

          "description": "I’m home! Over the past two weeks, I drove 1625 miles across across seven southeastern states. I had a blast hanging out with readers, friends, and colleagues. Plus, it was fun to explore some parts of the country that Kim and I skipped during our RV trip a few years ago. Most fun of all, though, was talking to dozens of different people about money.\n\nAfter two weeks of money talk, I have a lot to think about. I was struck, for instance, by how many people are paralyzed by the need to make perfect decisions. They’re afraid of making mistakes with their money, so instead of moving forward, they freeze — like a deer in headlights.\n\nIt might seem strange to claim that the pursuit of perfection prevents people from achieving their financial aims, but it’s true. Long-time readers know that this is a key part of my financial philosophy: The perfect is the enemy of the good.\n\nHere, for instance, is a typical reader email:\n\nThirty-plus years ago I was making much less money than when I retired so my tax rate was lower. I sometimes wonder now if it would have been better to pay the taxes at the time I earned the money and invest and pay taxes all along rather than deferring the taxes. You can make yourself crazy thinking about stuff like that!\n\nYes, you can make yourself crazy thinking about stuff like that. This reader retired early and has zero debt. They’re in great financial shape. Yet they’re fretting over the fact that tax-deferred investments might not have been the optimal choice back in 1986.\n\nRegret is one of the perils of perfectionism. There are others. Let’s look at why so many smart people find themselves fighting the urge to be perfect.\n\nMaximizers and Satisficers\n\nFor a long time, I was a perfectionist. When I had to make a decision, I only wanted to choose the best. At the same time, I was a deeply unhappy man who never got anything done. Although I didn’t realize it at the time, the pursuit of perfection was the root of my problems.\n\nIn 2005, I read The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz. This fascinating book explores how a culture of abundance actually robs us of satisfaction. We believe more options will make us happier, but the increased choice actually has the opposite effect. Especially for perfectionists.\n\nSchwartz divides the world into two types of people: maximizers and satisficers. Here’s how he describes the difference:\n\nChoosing wisely begins with developing a clear understanding of your goals. And the first choice you must make is between the goal of choosing the absolute best and choosing something that is good enough. If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer…Maximizers need to be assured that every purchase or decision was the best that could be made.\n\nIn other words, maximizers are perfectionists.\n\n“The alternative to maximizing is to be a satisficer,” writes Schwartz. “To satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better.”\n\nTo maximizers, this sounds like heresy. Settle for good enough? “Good enough seldom is!” proclaims the perfectionist. To her, the satisficer seems to lack standards. But that’s not true.\n\nA satisficer does have standards, and they’re often clearly defined. The difference is that a satisficer is content with excellent while a maximizer is on a quest for perfect.\n\nAnd here’s the interesting thing: All of this maximizing in pursuit of perfection actually leads to less satisfaction and happiness, not more. Here’s what Schwartz says about his research:\n\nPeople with high maximization [tendencies] experienced less satisfaction with life, were less optimistic, and were more depressed than people with low maximization [tendencies]…Maximizers are much more susceptible than satisficers to all forms of regret.\n\nSchwartz is careful to note that being a maximizer is correlated with unhappiness; there’s no evidence of a causal relationship. Still, it seems safe to assume that there is a connection.\n\nI’ve seen it in my own life.\n\nMaximizing in Real Life\n\nFor a long, long time, I was a maximizer. When I had to make any sort of decision, I researched the hell out of it. I wanted to buy and do and have only the best. But you know what? No matter how much time I put into picking the perfect product, it always fell short of my expectations. That’s because there’s no such thing as a perfect product.\n\nIn the olden days, for instance, if I needed to buy a dishwasher, I would make an elaborate spreadsheet to collate all of my options. I’d then consult the latest Consumer Reports buying guide, check Amazon reviews, and search for other resources to help guide my decision. I’d enter all of the data into my spreadsheet, then try to find the best option.\n\nThe trouble? There was rarely one best option for any choice I was trying to make. One dishwasher might use less energy while another produced cleaner dishes. This dishwasher might have special wine holders while that had the highest reliability scores. How was I supposed to find the perfect machine? Why couldn’t one manufacturer combine everything into one Super Dishwasher?\n\nIt was an impossible quest, and I know that now.\n\nNowadays, I’m mostly able to ignore my maximizing tendencies. I’ve taught myself to be a satisficer. When I had to replace my dead dishwasher three years ago, I didn’t aim for perfection. Instead, I made a plan and stuck to it.\n\nFirst, I set a budget. Because it would cost about $700 to repair our old dishwasher, I allowed myself that much for a new appliance.\n\nNext, I picked one store and shopped from its universe of available dishwashers.\n\nAfter that, I limited myself to only a handful of brands, the ones whose quality I trusted most.\n\nFinally, I gave myself a time limit. Instead of spending days trying to find the Best Dishwasher Ever, I allocated a couple of hours on a weekend afternoon to find an acceptable model.\n\nArmed with my Consumer Reports buying guide (and my phone so that I could look stuff up online), I marched into the local Sears outlet center. In less than an hour, I had narrowed my options from thirty dishwashers to three. With Kim’s help, I picked a winner.\n\nThe process was quick and easy. The dishwasher has served us well for the past three years, and I’ve had zero buyer’s remorse.\n\nA Trivial Example\nAt Camp FI in January, one of the attendees explained that he’s found freedom through letting go of trivial decisions. For things that won’t have a lasting impact on his life, he doesn’t belabor his options. Instead, he makes a quick decision and moves on.\n\nIn restaurants, for instance, he doesn’t look at every item on the menu. He doesn’t try to optimize his order. Instead, he makes a quick pass through the list, then picks the first thing that catches his eye. “It sounds silly,” he told me, “but doing this makes a huge difference to my happiness.”\n\nFor the past four months, I’ve been trying this technique. You know what? It works! I now make menu choices in seconds rather than minutes, and my dining experience is better because of it. This is a trivial example, I know, but it’s also illustrative of the point I’m trying to make.\n\nPerfect Procrastinators\n\nStudies have shown that perfectionists are more likely to have physical and mental problems than those who are open-minded and flexible. There’s another drawback to the pursuit of perfect: It costs time — and lots of it. To find the best option, whether it’s the top dishwasher or the ideal index fund, can take days or weeks or months. (And sometimes it’s an impossible mission.)\n\nThe pursuit of perfection is an exercise in diminishing returns:\n\nA bit of initial research is usually enough to glean the basics needed to make a smart decision.\n\nA little additional research is enough to help you separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nA moderate amount of time brings you to the point where you can make an informed decision and obtain quality results.\n\nTheoretically, if you had unlimited time, you might find the perfect option.\n\nThe more time you spend on research, the better your results are likely to be. But each unit of time you spend in search of higher quality offers less reward than the unit of time before.\n\nQuality is important. You should absolutely take time to research your investment and buying decisions. But remember that perfect is a moving target, one that’s almost impossible to hit. It’s usually better to shoot for “good enough” today than to aim for a perfect decision next week.\n\nProcrastination is one common consequence of pursuing perfection: You can come up with all sorts of reasons to put off establishing an emergency fund, to put off cutting up your credit cards, to put off starting a retirement account. But most of the time, your best choice is to start now.\n\nWho cares if you don’t find the best interest rate? Who cares if you don’t find the best mutual fund? You’ve found some good ones, right? Pick one. Get in the game. Just start. Starting plays a greater role in your success than any other factor. There will always be time to optimize in the future.\n\nWhen you spend so much time looking for the “best” choice that you never actually do anything, you’re sabotaging yourself. The perfect is the enemy of the good.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf your quest for the best is making you unhappy, then it’s hurting rather than helping. If your desire to get things exactly right is preventing you from taking any sort of positive action, then you’re better off settling for “good enough”. If you experience regret because you didn’t make an optimal choice in the past, force yourself to look at the sunny side of your decision.\n\nTrain yourself to be a satisficer. Ask yourself what “good enough” would mean each time you’re faced with a decision. What would it mean to accept that instead of perfection?\n\nIf you must pursue perfection, focus on the big stuff first. I get a lot of email from readers who fall into the optimization trap. They spend too much time and energy perfecting small, unimportant things — newspaper subscriptions, online savings accounts, etc. — instead of the things that matter most, such as housing and transportation costs. Fix the broken things first, then optimize the big stuff. After all of that is done, then it makes sense to get the small things perfect.\n\nPractice refinement. Start with “good enough”, then make incremental improvements over time. Say you’re looking for a new credit card. Instead of spending hours searching for the best option, find a good option and go with it. Then, in the months and years ahead, keep an eye out for better cards. When you find one you like, make the switch. Make perfection a long-term project.\n\nDon’t dwell on the past. If you’ve made mistakes, learn from them and move on. If you’ve made good but imperfect decisions — such as the Money Boss reader who wishes they hadn’t saved so much in tax-deferred accounts — celebrate what you did right instead of dwelling on the minor flaws in the results.\n\nEmbrace the imperfection. Everyone makes mistakes — even billionaires like Warren Buffett. Don’t let one slip-up drag you down. One key difference between those who succeed and those who don’t is the ability to recover from a setback and keep marching toward a goal. Use failures to learn what not to do next time.\n\nI don’t think perfection is a bad thing. It’s a noble goal. It’s not wrong to want the best for yourself and your family. But I think it’s important to recognize when the pursuit of perfection stands in your way rather than helps you build a better life.\n\nThe post The perfect is the enemy of the good appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",

          "description": "Free retirement planning guide from Vanguard\n\n posted by J.D. Roth on 24 April 2018  Leave a Comment \n\nVanguard, the mutual fund company, recently published a free retirement planning guide for folks like me who aren’t interested in hiring a professional financial advisor. Vanguard’s Roadmap to Financial Security is a 32-page document intended to provide DIY investors with a framework for decision-making in retirement.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from the intro to this retirement planning guide:\n\nRetirement is complex. In the face of often competing goals and numerous risks, the choices can be overwhelming, leaving many retirees unsure of where to begin. To help balance the many decisions to be made, we have constructed a retirement planning framework that allows retirees to capture their unique priorities and use their financial resources in a way that best aligns with achieving their goals and mitigating their risks.\n\nLike me, Vanguard believes that retirement planning starts by setting goals. What do you want to get out of life? In the case of retirement, how much do you want to spend on basic living expenses? How much do you want to have set aside for “contingencies”? How much do you want to spend on fun? How much do you want to leave after you die?\n\nNext, Vanguard’s retirement planning guide spends six pages exploring the risks of retirement and how to mitigate them. According to Vanguard, there are five primary risks in retirement:\n\nMarket risk, the possibility of losing purchasing power due to movements in the financial markets.\n\nHealth risk, a combination of your physical condition and your ability to pay for needed care.\n\nLongevity and mortality risk, which are two sides of the same coin: living longer than expected, or dying sooner than anticipated.\n\nEvent risk, those unexpected occurrences that cost big bucks.\n\nTax and policy risk, the odds that governmental and economic forces will have an impact on your retirement planning.\n\nThe next stop on Vanguard’s retirement planning roadmap is assessing your financial resources. How much have you saved? Do you have access to private pensions or annuities? What kind of insurance do you have? What’s your asset allocation? How will you spend your money in retirement? Will you work during retirement? (There are those who would argue that if you’re working, you’re not retired. I disagree. As we discussed a few weeks ago, there’s no single definition of retirement, and only one definition involves not working.)\n\nThe Vanguard retirement planning guide spends some time talking about home equity and how it relates to wealth. This is a fascinating subject, something GRS readers often discuss in the comments, and something that comes up all of the time at various early retirement events I attend. Most retirees hold a high percentage of their wealth in home equity. Should this value be considered when evaluating your net worth? When making plans for retirement spending? It’s an interesting question that we’ll have to explore further in the future.\n\nThe final stop on Vanguard’s retirement roadmap is developing a plan. After you’ve set goals, evaluated risks, and assessed your assets, it’s time to pull all of this info together to create a financial strategy.\n\n\r\n\r\n\n“There’s no universal formula for building the optimal retirement plan,” Vanguard writes. “The right mix of resources should be tailored to each household or individual. It should take into account the relative importance of competing goals and the risks that a retiree may be susceptible or sensitive to.”\n\nThe ultimate aim, says this retirement planning guide, is to obtain financial security, to know financial peace during your golden years.\n\nVanguard’s Roadmap to Financial Security isn’t complex and it’s not earth-shattering. It’s a simple and useful framework for retirement planning. If, like me, you do most of your own financial planning, I suspect you’ll find it thought-provoking.\n\n[via The Oblivious Investor]\n\n\r\n\r\n",

          "description": "A couple of drinks a day aren’t bad for you and may even be good for you. \n\nRight? \n\nThat’s been the message — from researchers, governments, and beverage companies — for decades. And as a result, many of us don’t think twice about tossing back a couple of glasses or wine or a few beers after work. \n\nBut maybe we should. Because it turns out the story about the health effects of moderate drinking is shifting pretty dramatically. New research on alcohol and mortality, and a growing awareness about the rise in alcohol-related deaths in the US, is causing a reckoning among researchers about even moderate levels of alcohol consumption.\n\nIn particular, an impressive new meta-study involving 600,000 participants, published recently in The Lancet, suggests that levels of alcohol previously thought to be relatively harmless are linked with an earlier death. What’s more, drinking small amounts of alcohol may not carry all the long-touted protective effects on the cardiovascular system. \n\n“For years, there was a sense that there was an optimal level which was not drinking no alcohol but drinking moderately that led to the best health outcomes,” said Duke University’s Dan Blazer, an author of the paper. “I think we’re going to have to rethink that a bit.”\n\nAlongside this study have come disturbing reports of the alcohol industry’s involvement in funding science that may have helped drinking look more favorable, as well as a growing worry that many people are naive about alcohol’s health effects.  How many people know, for example, that as far back as 1988, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer designated alcohol a level-one carcinogen? Some say too few. \n\nAnd maybe it’s time that changes — with some caveats, as usual. \n\nThe “French paradox,” and why researchers thought a bit of alcohol was good for you\n\nThe story of light drinking as a healthy behavior started to take off in the 1990s, when many researchers believed red wine might be a magical elixir. This idea was known as the “French paradox” — the observation that the French drank lots of wine and had lower rates of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWe now know this was wrong. But that idea was replaced by a narrative suggesting drinking small amounts of any type of alcohol — no more than one drink a day for women, two for men — appeared to be linked with modest health and heart benefits. \n\nIn long-term observational studies comparing drinkers and non-drinkers, light to moderate drinkers (who imbibed about one to two units of alcohol a day) often had better health outcomes compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. They had lower rates of heart disease and heart attacks and lived longer. Moderate drinkers also had lower rates of diabetes, another important risk factor for heart disease (although this result is less definitive).\n\nBut there was a problem with these studies: They generally compared drinkers to non-drinkers, instead of comparing lighter drinkers to heavier drinkers. And people who don’t drink are pretty fundamentally different from drinkers in ways that are hard to control for in a study. Their lives probably look pretty dissimilar. But most importantly, they may be sicker at baseline (perhaps they quit drinking because of alcoholism, or because of a health issue like cancer). And something in these differences — not their avoidance of alcohol — may have caused them to look like they were in poorer health than the moderate drinkers. (This became known as the “sick quitter” problem in the world of alcohol research.)\n\nMore recently, researchers have been trying to overcome that problem by comparing lighter drinkers with heavier drinkers. And the benefits of modest amounts of alcohol wash away.\n\nThe upper safe limit for drinking may be lower than you think \n\nThe most important new study on this was just published in The Lancet. Researchers brought together data on nearly 600,000 current drinkers (again, to overcome the “sick quitter” problem) from 83 studies in 19 countries. They wanted to tease out what level of drinking was associated with an increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease. \n\n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\nTheir findings were stark: Drinking more than 100 grams of alcohol — about seven standard glasses of wine or beer — per week was associated with an increased in risk of death for all causes. In the US, the government suggests men can drink double that amount — up to two drinks per day — but advise women who are not pregnant to drink up to one drink per day. \n\nA person’s risk of death shot up as they drank more. People who consumed between seven and 14 drinks per week had a lower life expectancy at age 40 of about six months; people who drank between 14 and 24 drinks per week had one to two years shaved off their lives; and people who imbibed more than 24 drinks a week had a lower life expectancy of four to five years. \n\nYou can see the risk increase in this chart here: \n\n        Lancet\n\n“We wanted to find how much alcohol people can drink before they started being at a higher risk of dying,” said the lead author on the study, Cambridge University biostatistics professor Angela Wood. “Our results suggest an upper safe limit of drinking of around 100g of alcohol per week for men and for women. Drinking above this limit was related to lower life expectancy.”\n\nAgain, that’s different from the US guidelines, which suggest men can drink double that. The recommended upper limits of alcohol consumption in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are about 50 percent higher than the seven-drinks-per-week threshold the paper revealed. \n\nThe researchers also estimated that men who halved their alcohol consumption — from about 14 drinks per week to about seven — might gain one to two years in life expectancy. \n\nWhat’s more, because they looked at so many studies on so many people, they were able to tease out alcohol’s effects on a number of measures of cardiovascular health — heart attack, heart failure, stroke. They found moderate alcohol consumption — around seven to 14 drinks per week — was associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease according to some of the measures they looked at, including stroke, aortic aneurysm, and heart failure​. These risks were generally higher for the people who drank more. \n\nThe exception was non-fatal heart attacks. The more people drank, the more their risk of heart attack went down. The researchers thought this may be driven by the fact that people who drink more tend to have high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol — or the “good cholesterol” — which could put them at a lower risk of dying from a heart attack. \n\nBut that benefit should be balanced against alcohol’s other cardiovascular risks, including stroke, aortic aneurysm, and heart failure, said Eastern Virginia Medical School researcher Andrew Plunk. “Even though there might be some benefit for heart attacks, the other risks associated with it wash that out,” he added. \n\nNewer research is finding similar associations with moderate levels of drinking. In a forthcoming paper, posted to BioRXiv, researchers took a similar approach to tease out the risks of drinking — using moderate drinkers instead of non-drinkers as the reference point to circumvent the “sick quitter” problem once again. The paper is only in pre-print and still needs to be peer-reviewed, but for now, its authors came to similar conclusions as the Lancet study, even though they used a different set of data. \n\nMore specifically, people who had one to two drinks four times or more weekly had a greater risk of dying from all causes than those who drank one to two drinks at a time weekly or less. And again, there was no difference between male and female study participants, which contradicts US government guidelines. \n\n“When the reference point is never-drinkers, it looks like you can drink a lot before you have an increased risk,” said Washington University School of Medicine substance dependence researcher Sarah Hartz, the lead author on the BioRXiv pre-print. “But if the reference is light drinkers, it looks like any amount of drinking will increase your risk.” \n\n“What we need to keep in mind is that alcohol is dangerous”\n\nBefore you empty out your liquor cabinet, however, there are a few important things to keep in mind. Nutrition science — including research on the effects of alcohol — is still in its infancy. There’s a lot even the best studies can’t tell us. What were the lives of the study participants like? How do they eat? Where did they live? Did they exercise? The supplementary material in the Lancet paper suggests these and other potential confounding factors may have been pretty important in determining people’s alcohol-associated health risks.\n\nFor example, in a subgroup analysis on the effects of alcohol by alcohol type, the Lancet authors found that spirit and beer drinkers seemed to have a higher risk of death and cardiovascular disease compared to wine drinkers. But they also found that beer and spirit drinkers looked pretty different from the wine drinkers: They were more likely to be lower income, male, and smokers and to have jobs that involved manual labor, compared with the wine drinkers.\n\n“These findings suggest that the heavy beer consumption is part of an unhealthy lifestyle that is more frequently seen among people with lower socioeconomic status,” said Cecile Janssens, a research professor of epidemiology at Emory University. “Unhealthy diet, smoking, less exercise, less access to health care, etc., might all contribute to the higher risks.” So you’d need to take these other factors into account to truly understand the risks of alcohol consumption. And it’s possible that just cutting back alcohol, in this context, wouldn’t make much of a difference in their life expectancy. \n\nPlus, Blazer said, “if you try to abide by every public health warning out there for every adverse effect, you’d have a miserable life. You wouldn’t do anything.” \n\nNonetheless, the new research is a reminder of something we often forget: Alcohol’s health effects are real, and they are serious. Drinking increases the risk of everything from liver disease to high blood pressure, dependency issues, and memory and mental health problems. As Vox’s German Lopez has reported, alcohol-related deaths have been going up in America — an underappreciated fact that’s been lost in the coverage of opioids.   \n\n“Not a lot of people know alcohol is a level-one carcinogen,” Harvard Medical School addiction researcher John F. Kelly told me. Any amount of drinking is associated with an increased breast cancer risk — something journalist Stephanie Mencimer admitted in Mother Jones she didn’t know until she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. “While doctors have frequently admonished me for putting cream in my coffee lest it clog my arteries ... not once has any doctor suggested I might face a higher cancer risk if I didn’t cut back on drinking,” she wrote. For men and women, drinking is also known to increase the risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon cancer. \n\nBut when the weekend rolls around, and you want to cut loose, it’s not easy to face up to these facts. Alcohol is a huge part of our culture, and the problems it can carry aren’t always easy to swallow. But these new studies should sound a cautionary note, Blazer said.\n\n“The idea that I can drink three drinks per day and it’ll help me live longer — I think you have to eliminate that from your thinking. What we need to keep in mind is that alcohol is dangerous — and the danger of alcohol doesn’t receive the attention it deserves.”  \n",

          "description": "“It’s really an addiction.”\n \nWhat happens to your brain on love? Is there such a thing as “casual sex”? What do we get wrong about male and female sexuality?\n\nThese are a few of the questions I put to Helen Fisher in a recent interview. \n\nFisher is a biological anthropologist, the chief scientific adviser to the dating site Match.com, and the author of several books including Why We Love: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love. \n\nShe’s written six books about human sexuality, gender differences in the brain, and how cultural trends shape our views of sex, love, and attachment. Fisher, in other words, has spent a lot of time thinking about the role of sex and love in human life. \n\nSo I reached out to her to find out what she has learned and how it undercuts a lot of our conventional ideas about sexuality and gender. \n\nI also wanted to know what distinguishes love from attachment, and why she thinks there are three simple things you can to do maintain a happy relationship. \n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. \n\nSean Illing\n\nWhat happens to our brains on love?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nIt’s a fascinating question. My colleagues and I put over 100 people who had recently fallen in love into the brain scanner to understand what’s going on in their brains. \n\nWe found that in almost all cases there was activity in a tiny little part of the brain called the ventral tegmental area (or VTA). It turns out that this brain system makes dopamine, which is a natural stimulant, and then sends that stimulant to many other brain regions. \n\nThat’s what gives you the focus, the energy, the craving, and the motivation to win life’s greatest prize: a mating partner.\n\nSean Illing\n\nAnd the experience of love, at the level of the brain, is different from the experience of sex or from feelings of attachment?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nThe sex drive is largely orchestrated by testosterone in both men and women, but romantic love is orchestrated by the dopamine system. I see romantic love as a basic drive that evolved millions of years ago to focus your mating energy on just one individual and start the mating process. \n\nThe sex drive motivates you to look for a whole range of partners, but romantic love is about focusing your mating energy on one person at a time. \n\n“You can think of love as an intense obsession, but it’s really an addiction.”\n\nSean Illing\n\nSo being in love is like being hooked up to a perpetual dopamine drip, and you get a little hit every time you see the person or touch them or think about them?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nDopamine drip — I love that phrase! I haven’t heard that before; it’s a great way to put it. But the dopamine hits occur even when you’re not with the person. \n\nYou can think of love as an intense obsession, but it’s really an addiction. You think about them all the time; you become sexually possessive; you get butterflies in the stomach; you can read their emails and texts over and over again.\n\nBut I say it’s an addiction because we found that, in addition to the dopamine system being activated in the brains of people in love, we also found activity in another part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. \n\nThis part of the brain is activated in all forms of behavioral addiction — whether it’s drugs or gambling or food or kleptomania. So this part of the brain fires up in people who have recently fallen in love, and it really does function like an addiction. \n\nWhich is why romantic love is a far more powerful brain system than the sex drive. \n\nSean Illing\n\nI’ve heard you say that “casual sex” isn’t as casual as we think. Why not?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nIt’s not casual because when you have sex with somebody, and it’s pleasurable, it drives up the dopamine system in the brain. That can push you over the threshold into falling in love. \n\nAnd when you orgasm, there’s a flood of oxytocin and vasopressin. Those neurochemicals are linked with the attachment system in the brain. \n\nSo there are all these potential chemical triggers that can get activated when you have sex with someone, whether it’s “casual” or not. Something like one-third of people who’ve had a “friends with benefits” relationship have fallen madly in love with that person. \n\nSo casual sex is not casual: It can trigger these brain systems for romantic love and feelings of attachment. \n\nSean Illing\n\nIn other words, don’t have sex with someone unless you’re prepared to fall in love with them.\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nExactly. If you’re on vacation and there are natural barriers and you’re unlikely to see them again, then that’s probably safe. But otherwise you’re risking falling in love, and that might complicate your life in ways you’re not prepared for. \n\nSean Illing \n\nWhat do we, as a culture, get wrong about male and female sexuality?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nA lot. We think men want to have sex with everything that walks, but that’s not true. They’re much more picky than people think. \n\nI think we also got it wrong that women are not interested in sex. Among people under the age of 40, women are apparently just as adulterous as men. Women in college have more sex than men in college do, largely because women have the pick of the place when they’re in college, and men don’t. \n\nBut the idea that men need or desire sex more than women is a fantasy. \n\nI’ve been telling women’s magazines for 30 years that men fall in love faster than women do because they’re so visual, and they fall in love more often. Men like public displays of affection more regularly, which sounds romantic but isn’t. \n\nThis is probably a form of mate guarding, a way of informing everybody that “she’s with me.” Men want to introduce women they fall in love with to friends and family sooner. Men also want to move in with a woman that they’re in love with sooner. \n\nMen have more intimate conversations with their girlfriends and wives than women do with their husbands and boyfriends because women have their intimate conversations with their girlfriends, not necessarily with their man. \n\nMen are also 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves when a relationship is over. That is something that the press and the public really have wrong.\n\nSean Illing \n\nWait, men are 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves when a relationship fails? Do you have an explanation for that?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nIt’s a really good question. All I have is a hypothesis. I don’t think anyone has come up with a good Darwinian explanation. Women appeal to their networks. I mean, they will threaten suicide, but often they don’t follow through or they do try to kill themselves and fail. But men do the job.\n\nI think some of this has to do with how differently men and women express their emotions. Women’s emotions are always dribbling out. We tend to be more emotionally expressive. \n\nMen hide their emotions, probably because for millions of years it was not adaptive for men to express their frailty or their fear. Their job was to protect the group. Their job was to protect the wife and family. Their job was to go out and kill very dangerous wild animals and bring home dinner. \n\nUnder those circumstances, it’s really not adaptive to be expressing your fear, your anger, your surprise, your vulnerability. \n\nSo men are better at containing their emotions, but they are also more predisposed to what we call emotional flooding. Unlike women, they hold their anger in, but eventually that anger builds up and explodes. \n\nI suspect this is related to suicide in some way, but it’s just a hypothesis. \n\nSean Illing\n\nLove is love and I assume your data holds whether we’re talking about gay or straight couples, or gay or straight men and women, but I want to ask just in case you’ve noticed any differences.\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nI have data on several hundred gay men and they fall in love just as often as straight men. (As I mentioned, romantic love is a brain system like anger and fear, everyone has this brain system—regardless of to whom their romantic feelings are directed). But I have no data on whether gay men are just as likely to kill themselves when a relationship ends. Actually, I’ve never seen these data either. But it might exist.\n\nSean Illing\n\nI’m sure you get pushback from people who worry about reducing something as rich and complex as love to brain systems. What’s your general response to this concern?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nThis basic brain physiology is only part of the experience. You asked me about the brain circuitry associated with romantic love, so that’s what I told you about. This isn’t reductionistic; I was just trying to explain part of a vast complex system. I’ve spent my entire intellectual life chipping away at a vast array of phenomena associated with romantic love. And surely basic brain circuitry is part of this. \n\nBut this work of mine only explains how the brain generates the ecstatic, possessive, obsessive feelings of romantic love. It doesn’t explain who you love, how you express your love, where you love, or when you love.\n\nBut for those who feel this is reductionistic: I often say “You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake and still sit down and eat the cake and feel that joy. The same with love. There will always be magic to love.” \n\nThose who study the fear system aren’t called “reductionistic.” But when it comes to love, people seem to think this comes from the supernatural. It doesn’t. It’s one of the most powerful brain systems humanity has evolved. \n\nPeople pine for love, live for love, kill for love and die for love. Everywhere in the world, people have love songs and love poems, and most places also have novels, TV series, ballets, operas, symphonies, myths, legends, and even holidays for love. Everywhere people also stalk, murder and/or kill themselves over love. \n\nI will go to my grave believing that it’s worthwhile to understand the brain circuitry involved in this unquenchable, adaptable and primordial human trait: romantic love.\n\nSean Illing\n\nYou’ve done a lot of research for Match.com. What makes for a happy marriage or relationship?\n\nHelen Fisher\n\nYou talk to a psychologist, and they’ll probably give you a different answer, but I can tell you what the brain says about happiness in a longterm partnership. There are three brain regions that become active when you are in a longterm, loving relationship. \n\nA brain region linked with empathy, a brain region linked with controlling your own stress and your own emotions, and a brain region linked with what I call “positive illusion,” the ability to overlook what you don’t like about somebody and focus on what you do. \n\nYou want a happy marriage? Do all those things that psychologists and others might suggest, but this is what the brain says: Express empathy, control your own emotions, and overlook the negatives in your partner and focus on the positives.",

But what books bring Americans deep, blithe pleasure?\n\nStarting in May, PBS will run a series called The Great American Read, in which journalist Meredith Vieira traverses the country to interview people about their favorite novels. PBS will also run a nationwide survey starting May 22, in which Americans can vote as many times as they’d like for their favorite title among a list of 100.\n\nTo make the top 100 list, polling company YouGov asked a representative sample of 7,366 Americans to answer the question, “What is your most-loved novel?” The surveys returned a list of 700 individual titles, which editors culled, limiting it to novels, one title per author, and books published in the US in English.\n\nBased on our count, about half of the books in the top 100 list are considered classics or are books you might see on an American high school curriculum. More than 80 authors on the list are white, and just under 70 are men. Around 60 of the authors are American.\n\nAbout a quarter are books written for kids or teens, and three-quarters have been made into a movie or TV show.

          "description": "A top-tier Android phone can cost upwards of a thousand dollars, and for that money, you’ll get some amazing features. It will have a stellar screen, top-flight camera, gobs of storage, and an absolutely atrocious texting experience.\n\nIt’s a problem. In fact, it’s always been a problem. Google has spent nearly a decade trying — and failing — to fix it with an ever-rotating cast of poorly supported apps. While iPhone users have had the simplicity of iMessage built in, Android users have been left to fend for themselves. \n\nNow, the company is doing something different. Instead of bringing a better app to the table, it’s trying to change the rules of the texting game, on a global scale. Google has been quietly corralling every major cellphone carrier on the planet into adopting technology to replace SMS. It’s going to be called “Chat,” and it’s based on a standard called the “Universal Profile for Rich Communication Services.” SMS is the default that everybody has to fall back to, and so Google’s goal is to make that default texting experience on an Android phone as good as other modern messaging apps.\n\nAs part of that effort, Google says it’s “pausing” work on its most recent entry into the messaging space, Allo. It’s the sort of “pause” that involves transferring almost the entire team off the project and putting all its resources into another app, Android Messages.\n\nGoogle won’t build the iMessage clone that Android fans have clamored for, but it seems to have cajoled the carriers into doing it for them. In order to have some kind of victory in messaging, Google first had to admit defeat.\n\n        Illustration by William Joel & Garret Beard\n\nWhat Chat will be\n\nChat is not a new texting app. Instead, think of it more like a new set of features inside the app already installed on most Android phones. “Chat” is the consumer-friendly name for Rich Communication Services (RCS), the new standard that’s meant to supplant SMS, and it will automatically be turned on inside Android Messages, the OS’s default app for texting. \n\nWhen people begin using Chat, they’ll get many features that are standard in any other texting app, including read receipts, typing indicators, full-resolution images and video, and group texts. \n\nBut remember, Chat is a carrier-based service, not a Google service. It’s just “Chat,” not “Google Chat.” In a sign of its strategic importance to Google, the company has spearheaded development on the new standard, so that every carrier’s Chat services will be interoperable. But, like SMS, Chat won’t be end-to-end encrypted, and it will follow the same legal intercept standards. In other words: it won’t be as secure as iMessage or Signal.\n\nThe new Chat services will be turned on for most people in the near future, though timing will be dictated by each carrier. Google is optimistic many carriers will flip the switch this year, but there could be some stragglers. Chat messages will be sent with your data plan instead of your SMS plan, so you’ll likely only be charged for whatever (minimal) data it costs to send a message. Though, again, it will be up to the carriers.\n\nIf you are texting somebody who doesn’t have Chat enabled or is not an Android user, your messages will revert back to SMS — much in the same way that an iMessage does. Nobody outside of Apple knows when (or if) the iPhone will support Chat.\n\nInstead of continuing to push Allo — or creating yet another new chat app — Google is instead going to introduce new features into the default Android Messages app, like GIF search and Google Assistant. Android Messages will be the default on many (but not all) Android phones. Samsung phones will also support Chat using Samsung’s app. You will still be able to download Google’s app if you’d prefer to use it, though it seems unlikely that third-party developers will be able to create full RCS-enabled apps.\n\n        Anil Sabharwal.\n\n        Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nReboot again\n\nGoogle has put a new executive in charge of the effort: Anil Sabharwal. He led the team that created the Google Photos apps, which are perhaps the most successful Google apps of the past few years. They’re also a great example of how Google salvaged ideas originally built into Google+ and turned them into a great set of cross-platform apps.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense that CEO Sundar Pichai tasked Sabharwal with fixing one of the oldest and most vexing problems at Google. Sabharwal has to find a way to make the default texting experience on Android not just good, but part of a dominant global network that can actually compete with the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and iMessage. And he needs to do it without alienating any of the hundreds of powerful companies that have a stake in the smartphone market. \n\n“I’m coming into this as a consumer product person,” Sabharwal says. Six months ago, he took over the communications team and took inventory of Google’s offerings and strategies. As a result of Google’s “try everything” approach to messaging, the company currently has four major competing messaging apps: Hangouts, Allo, Duo, and Android Messages. \n\nLet’s go through them one by one. Hangouts is becoming an enterprise app to compete with Slack, called “Hangouts Chat” instead of being a consumer focused app. That transition is taking awhile and at some point, Google will need to clear up its messaging for consumers that are still using Hangouts for personal texting. Right now, the company’s guidance is that “the consumer version of Hangouts will be upgraded to Hangouts Chat ... but our focus for Hangouts still rests on enterprise/team communication and messaging.” I wouldn’t be surprised if a free version was made available to consumers someday, but, as with Allo, if might be time to start looking for alternatives.\n\nAnd Duo, Google’s new-ish video chat app, is actually surprisingly successful; a quarter of Duo calls are to or from an iPhone. But it’s primarily a video chat app, which leaves Allo and Android Messages: two apps that, from a “consumer product” perspective, do essentially the same thing. \n\nAndroid Messages has all the users. Even though Samsung phones don’t use Android Messages as the default SMS app, most of the other major manufacturers do (outside of China, anyway). That adds up to 100 million monthly active users, according to Sabharwal. “At the end of the day … the native SMS app is where users are,” he says. “They’re not interested in going to a different place to use SMS.”\n\nPeople, even in 2018, tend to just use the default app. Though WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger each have over a billion installs, those users are still falling back to SMS when they have to. It’s the universal, default option; every phone supports it, and it always works. Sabharwal estimates that 8 trillion SMS-based messages are sent every year.\n\n“The native SMS app is where users are.”  \n\n        Google Allo.\n\nAllo, though it’s a perfectly capable and functional messaging app, has never managed to build a large user base. Sabharwal looked at Allo and saw “a clearly great set of product features, a great set of capabilities.” He looked at Android Messages and saw “a product that has tremendous momentum.”\n\nSo the move was obvious: shift all that effort from Allo, which doesn’t have a clear path to getting more users, and put it into migrating the app’s features into the default, Android Messages. “My first thing is I’m going to bring these things together,” Sabharwal says. “That’s the first decision that we’ve made.”\n\nPut more bluntly: Google is giving up on having its own consumer messaging app, a heads-up competitor to Facebook Messenger. “There are a lot of great messaging products and experiences that are out there,” says Sabharwal. “Just because Google may want to be one of them is not a reason for us to invest or build products. We fundamentally build products because we believe we can deliver better, improved user experiences.”\n\nTake a step back. It seems ridiculous that a company as large and powerful as Google would simply give up on directly competing in the messaging space, but here we are. The question, then, is how on earth did we get here?\n\nAllo the apps that didn’t work \n\nA brief and very incomplete history of Android’s Messaging Mess\n\nAugust 2005: Google Talk (aka Google Chat)\n\nOctober 2008: Android launches with support for Google Talk & SMS\n\nJune 2011: Google+ launches, distracting everybody.

WhatsApp reports 1 billion messages per day\n\nMay 2013: Google+ Hangouts launches, merging other Google messaging and video chat apps\n\nSeptember 2014: Google Voice integrated into Hangouts\n\nApril 2015: Project Fi launches, also integrating with Hangouts\n\nJanuary 2016: Google Messenger becomes the preferred SMS app on Android, deprecating Hangouts for texting.\n\nMay 2016: Google launches Allo, a texting app, and Duo, a video chat app\n\nJune 2016: Google Talk for Android and Google Chat in Gmail discontinued\n\nFebruary 2017: Messenger is renamed Android Messages, announced it will be the default RCS app\n\nMarch 2017: Google announces Hangouts is becoming Hangouts Chat, focused on enterprise use\n\nApril 2018: Google is “pausing investment” in Allo, focusing instead on Chat, a new standard to replace SMS\n\nGoogle’s plan this time around is much more complicated than just launching a new messaging app. To get it started, it has had to corral more than 50 carriers and nearly a dozen manufacturers into adopting a new standard. It had to ensure that Chat would work the same, everywhere, and that it would actually have a decent set of features. Oh, and all those companies are fierce competitors who distrust each other and Google.\n\nIt is as close to the hardest, most winding road that I can imagine for fixing the messaging mess on Android. It’s also probably one of the only roads Google had left to try. \n\nGoogle’s most prominent messaging dead end was Hangouts. Launched almost exactly five years ago, it was Google’s most ambitious attempt to compete with iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. It had a huge, splashy launch befitting its scope, and it successfully managed to merge a bunch of disparate Google apps into a single, unified system.\n\nHangouts was undone by Google’s often scattered corporate priorities and, frankly, sometimes institutional inability to execute on consumer products. It began as a product that was deeply enmeshed in Google+, Google’s failed social network. Extricating Hangouts from that fiasco took years. \n\nHangouts also became an integration point for other services like SMS, a live video streaming service, Google Voice, and Project Fi. That sounds good in theory, but in practice, it meant the app’s overall purpose kept changing. One moment, it was an integrated SMS and chat app, and the next, it wasn’t. All the while, the thing began to feel slow and lumbering on phones, and too basic on desktops. \n\nInstead of spinning Hangouts down (it’s honestly too enmeshed in Google’s own internal work culture to do that), Google pivoted it. Hangouts is now an enterprise chat app designed to compete with Slack. \n\nThe next road Google took was more obvious: launch a new, mobile-first texting app and convince people to use it. That app was Allo, which launched two years ago.\n\nAllo is a “fine” app, with all the features you’d expect along with integration with Google Assistant, which launched alongside Allo. “The strategy behind Allo was ‘let’s build a really great consumer messaging product really from the ground up,’” Sabharwal says.\n\nBut in 2016 (to say nothing of 2018), simply making a good messaging app wasn’t enough — not when it has to compete with established giants. Allo also likely suffered from Google messaging app fatigue. People worried it wouldn’t be supported over the long term. (It turns out, they were right.)\n\nIf you’re going to launch a messaging app, you need a good strategy for achieving growth. iMessage worked because it was built right into the iPhone. WhatsApp worked because it was tied to phone numbers and let users avoid paying SMS fees. (And it had the benefit of being the first popular app to take advantage of push notifications.) Facebook Messenger worked because it was built on Facebook.\n\n“The product as a whole has not achieved the level of traction that we’d hoped for.” \n\nAllo had no such strategy for acquiring users. The closest Google came was a scheme using Google’s own services on Android. When you sent an Allo message to somebody who didn’t have the app installed, they’d receive a Google push notification instead of an SMS. The notification encouraged them to install the app (though they could reply directly without it).\n\nTwo years later, fewer than 50 million Android users have installed Allo. Considering that WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both clock in at over a billion installs, those numbers just aren’t good enough. As Sabharwal gamely puts it, “The product as a whole has not achieved the level of traction that we’d hoped for.” \n\nThat means that Google had to admit that the Allo experiment didn’t work. As a result, Sabharwal says that Google is “pausing investment” in Allo. That doesn’t mean that it’s shutting down; Sabharwal says that Google is “continuing to support the product.” But if you’re an Allo user, it’s definitely time to start looking elsewhere. My guess is that it’s a dead app walking (or, if you like, texting).\n\nThere’s one other option that I and many others have always hoped Google would have the courage to try: just copy iMessage, but for Android.\n\nThough Google won’t say so, I think that road is fundamentally too dangerous for the company. One would think that Google has more than enough leverage to simply create something that the carriers would have to accept whether they like it or not. What are Verizon and Deutsche Telecom and all the rest going to do, switch to Tizen in protest? Please.\n\nBut the truth is that these carriers have points of leverage over Google that go beyond choosing to sell Android phones. Android is, after all, open source. And though Google can (and does) dictate some requirements in order to include Google services, it can’t dictate them all. A carrier could set Bing as the default search, for example, or set up its own RCS client as the default texting app. \n\nPerhaps Google could have gotten away with a proprietary, baked-in messaging protocol back in 2011 when iMessage launched. But in 2018, carriers aren’t fond of iMessage, and they aren’t going to take kindly to a similar service acting as the default, especially on Android, the globally dominant operating system. Even though it looks like they won’t charge exorbitant SMS prices to consumers, RCS is still preferable to carriers as it will give them the opportunity to sell RCS services to businesses. The GSMA estimates that will be a $74 billion market by 2021. \n\nIn sum, Google tried damn near everything. Only two roads were left: one that would cause all its carrier partners to freak out and one that handed them the keys to a shiny new messaging platform they could call their own.\n\nSabharwal doesn’t paint the decision to partner with carriers in those terms, of course. Instead, he points to Google’s penchant for keeping Android not just open, but neutral. Instead of the nuclear option, Google wants to keep the platform at least nominally neutral. “We believe that there’s a fundamentally better experience we can deliver to users,” Sabharwal says. He continues:\n\nWe can’t do it without these [carrier and OEM] partners. We don’t believe in taking the approach that Apple does. We are fundamentally an open ecosystem. We believe in working with partners. We believe in working with our OEMs to be able to deliver a great experience.\n\n        Android Messages web client preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nThe rollout\n\nSMS is awful. It started as a kind of a hack on top of preexisting cellular systems, and it never really developed much. The Multimedia Messaging Service add-on came later and was equally crappy. These services aren’t just antiquated; they’re expensive. “No one says ‘Hey bud hit me up on MMS,’” Sabharwal quips. They say “text me.” And again, the default texting experience on Android is bad. This is a problem that needs fixing. \n\nSince 2007, the fix was always supposed to be RCS, but RCS hasn’t taken hold for completely predictable reasons. Different carriers developed incompatible versions of the “standard,” each trying to gain an edge. All the while, they were getting disrupted by tech companies who simply made over-the-top vertically integrated messaging products that just relied on data connections. Talk to nearly any analyst in the tech space, and you’ll find they’re dismissive that RCS could ever work. Here’s Dean Bubley of Disruptive Analysis last year on RCS:\n\nSo ignore it. There are no customers, no use-cases, and no revenues associated with “advanced messaging”. It’s the same pointless RCS zombie-tech I’ve been accurately predicting would fail for the last decade. It’s still dead, still shambling around and still trying to eat your brain. It’s managed to bite Google and Samsung, and they’ll probably try to infect you as well.\n\nAnd yet, Google has spent the last couple of years trying to get consensus around something called the “Universal Profile,” a standardized way to make RCS work across carriers. Google’s pitch to carriers is simple: SMS is going to be replaced one way or another. You can either be part of the replacement or continue to watch Apple and Facebook run away with text messaging. \n\nGoogle has also been lining up businesses that want to replace SMS for communicating with customers. Instead of a text message with a short link, you can have your boarding pass or Subway sandwich order or whatever appear right in your texting app. Right now, the best options for businesses that want rich messaging opportunities for customers are iMessage and Facebook — neither of which are as universal as SMS.  \n\nCarriers have slowly been coming on board. Two big holdouts, AT&T and Verizon, quietly agreed to support the standard in the past few months. Given how fractious the history has been here, I’m sort of impressed that Google got everybody to call this feature “Chat” instead of “AT&T super premium advanced messaging plus” or whatever. As of this writing, 55 carriers, 11 OEMs, and two operating system providers have all pledged to either adopt or switch over to the system. \n\n        Android Messages Group Chat Preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nThe two operating system providers that have signed on to the Universal Profile: Google and, interestingly, Microsoft. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can expect a native Chat app in Windows 10, but it does mean it’s possible. Microsoft’s statement on RCS is noncommittal at best: “RCS Universal Profile support for capabilities such as dialer and messaging functionality or other applications is considered on a device-by-device basis, where there is demand for those features.”\n\nUnfortunately, we aren’t likely to get one big, splashy moment when Chat “just works.” I press Sabharwal multiple times on this issue: when are carriers going to switch users over? “I don’t have a crystal ball,” he demurs. “I don’t know exactly how long it’s going to be, but we really feel that we are on the cusp of it right now.” Later, he relents and says, “Look, I can speculate, which I think is what you’re asking me to do.”\n\n”By the end of this year, we’ll be in a really great state, and by mid-next year, we’ll be in a place where a large percentage of users [will have] this experience.” Though, he cautions that “it will differ from country to country” and from region to region. Europe and Latin America are likely to enable it before US carriers. Still, he stresses, “This is not a three- to five-year play. Our goal is to get this level of quality messaging to our users on Android within the next couple of years.”\n\nIn the United States, Sprint supports Chat right now between compatible Android phones. T-Mobile has promised to do so in Q2 of this year. When I asked for comment, neither Verizon nor AT&T would give me a timeline for when they intend to flip the switch to support Chat.\n\nThe middle period is going to be annoying. If your carrier or your device doesn’t support Chat, you’ll get old-fashioned SMS and MMS messages — and vice versa. Importantly, that means that iPhone users won’t be part of this ecosystem. \n\nBut I have a hunch that the pressure is on to get Apple to support Chat, not just from Google but from carriers and other businesses. Sources familiar with RCS say Google, along with multiple mobile operators, is in discussion with Apple about supporting RCS. Apple declined to comment.\n\nCarrier control\n\nIf you’re still trying to wrap your head around the idea that Google won’t have a standalone consumer chat app, well, so am I. “The fundamental thesis behind the RCS protocol is it’s a carrier service,” Sabharwal says. That means that the carriers will be the final arbiters of what Chat can and can’t do — and whether it will be successful. The good news is that Google appears to have herded all the carrier cats into a box where their Chat services will actually be interoperable. \n\nRight now, the expectation is that carriers won’t charge SMS-style rates for Chat messages. “Messages will work just like any other IP-based messaging protocol. So, in that respect, it’ll just be ‘free’ and part of your data plan,” Sabharwal says. That’s probably true, but it’s definitely outside Google’s control. Any communication standard that depends on the largess of wireless carriers is inherently at risk of getting messed up in dozens of ways, including price.\n\n        The companies that support the RCS Universal Profile as of April 2018.\n\n        Image: GSMA\n\nThe worse news is that carriers aren’t fond of strong encryption and don’t have a great history of pushing back against government demands for information. \n\n”RCS continues to be a carrier-owned service, so legal intercept and other laws that exist that allow carriers to have access to the data continues to be the case,” Sabharwal admits. And though Google isn’t shutting down Allo, it’s also not working to create a chat service that is as secure as iMessage, Signal, or even Telegram. “At this point, the answer is no. We will not have that option,” Sabharwal says. Allo offers an “incognito” mode that does support end-to-end encryption, but that’s it.\n\nFor a company that has a reputation for rapaciously collecting user data and then turning that data into ads and services, it’s surprising to hear that Google doesn’t want an owned-and-operated chat app. Basically, it sounds like Sabharwal doesn’t think it has to. And it may not have an alternative: the company hasn’t been able to find a way to make an owned-and-operated chat app succeed in nearly a decade.\n\n”I don’t want to say that were ‘ceding messaging’ [to the carriers],” Sabharwal says. Instead, Google believes that it can deliver Google services inside the Android Messages app. It won’t control the transport of those messages, but it can improve the user experience by building the app itself.\n\n        Smart reply in Android Messages preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nSo expect a couple things to happen on the app front. First, Google will finally make a desktop web interface for texting. At least in the initial version, you’ll authorize it with a QR code, much as you do with WhatsApp. That makes it essentially an extension of your phone, like the WhatsApp client, so the only message history it’ll have is what is on your phone. \n\nSecond, expect the Android Messages app to rapidly acquire more features. With luck, its development won’t stagnate like Hangouts did. It’s worth keeping an eye on, because some features can be developed in the app itself and others may require coordinating work with all the carriers on the Chat standard itself.\n\nSabharwal can explain the nuances of RCS hubs, carrier negotiations, and Google’s own (optional) Jibe RCS cloud services. But more than any of that, he’s eager to talk about the features he wants to bring to Android Messages. Smart replies. Google Assistant. Integration with his other project, Google Photos. Clearer organization of messages. Better search. More “expressiveness” (read: GIFs and stickers). \n\nAt the end of the day, users care about those features. They care about having “blue bubbles,” those cultural indicators that you’re having a conversation in a channel that isn’t limited to 160-character messages hurled into the void. Google’s path to getting those features to the 2 billion-plus Android users around the world has been rocky, to put it mildly. \n\nThe rollout of Chat could be equally rocky. Some carriers will hold out either through obstinacy or inability. Some Android phones may also be left out, depending on their manufacturer. There are risks that infighting between all the companies trying to work together could collapse the whole effort. And, especially in the US, nobody really knows if or when Apple will bow to pressure to support RCS. (Apple, as you’re surely aware, isn’t one to bow to pressure.)\n\nAfter talking about all that, Sabharwal finally lets me take a look at a presentation showing an upcoming version of Android Messages. It has all the features he’s hoping to deliver. The messages delivered over Chat happened to be blue. But that was just happenstance: one of the features of Android Messages is that you can pick a custom color for your chat messages, depending on whom you’re speaking with. This is Android, after all, and Android is all about customization.\n\nCustomization is messy. Android is messy. So it makes sense that the ultimate fix for Android messaging wasn’t to eliminate messiness, but to embrace it.\n",

          "description": "My wall is all about the good vibes (and lots of pink)!\n\nBuilding a gallery wall is an excellent home design project. Achievable for anyone—regardless of design acumen or handiness (I am a good example!)—a gallery wall turns art into art. You can take art and photos that you love on their own, and transform them into something that stands out as a collection.\n\nThere’s really no wrong way to build a gallery wall. Tailor it to your own taste and to the vibe of your particular space. You can make yours sleek and minimal by using all of the same frames and spacing them evenly. On the opposite end of spectrum, you can mix and match frames (colors and materials), and space them in an intentionally haphazard way for a funkier look. Then there’s an entire range in the middle: Choose all white and black frames, maybe, or choose all gold frames in a variety of sizes.\n\nMy blank canvas of wall looking as intimidating as possible.\n\nThere are a few useful tips I’ve gleaned through trial and error to help you succeed at building a gallery wall of your own. The most important bit of advice is to have a vision before you begin. It’s best to have a firm plan to lay out before starting.\n\nPick a Style\n\nFirst, decide on your style. My style for this gallery wall was eclectic and colorful. We have a very minimal, white, uncluttered house—small and right on the water in a sleepy little beach town—so I wanted a pop of interest and color to brighten up our bedroom. Consider your own space and what would work best.\n\nMy first apartment (with my sister) was a sprawling pre-war space with old, polished floorboards and lots of character. We decided to install a huge gallery wall of family photos, but we went with all white wooden frames of different sizes—this helped to create a simple look that balanced out the busyness of the rest of the space. To help you think through your style, break it down into two components:\n\n1. Color: Do you want your frames to all match? Consider the colors of your art and photography. Choose complementary hues and tones. If you have a lot of color in your art, it’s nice to go with less mixing of frame color and material.\n\n2. Scale: You can mix and match the sizes of frames, which creates a nice look to the wall and helps to fill the space. I like this method when you have a variety of art and photography. If you’re hanging all similar items (20 black-and-white photos, for example), consider using all uniformly-sized frames and spacing them evenly.\n\nGeometric Wood Frames\n\nSelf-Adhesive Wallpaper, Hojas Cubanas\n\nPlanning\n\nOnce you have decided on a style and framed all of your pieces, you’re ready to begin. If you’re planning on evenly spacing all of your art, you simply need to measure out where to hang, and go at it. If you want the look of uneven spacing like my gallery wall, you have two options for laying out the wall. One is for very organized, methodical people and the other is for…people who are less so!\n\n1. Plan Ahead: If you want to be extra cautious about how the art will look, you can cut out pieces of paper and tape them up to figure out the layout you like. I like to use brown construction paper for this. Cut out pieces that correspond with the size of each of your frames, then tape them to your wall. You can move them around until you like the spacing between each. This is a useful method as you can simply nail through the paper and pull it off after, which allows for more precision in hanging.\n\n2. Freestyle: I’ve done the more methodical approach before, but this time I decided to live on the edge and freestyle my gallery wall. To do this, I placed all of my frames on the floor and arranged them in roughly the layout I wanted. Then I started hanging the first frame, and spaced each subsequent frame in relation to the ones next to it. This is slightly riskier, but the silver lining is you get a more organic arrangement of frames, which I like the look of.\n\nInstallation Tips\n\nStart at one corner and take the plunge to build \"at random.\"\n\nMake sure you test out your wall before starting to build. Check that it’s strong enough to hold heavier art, if you have heavy pieces. To do this, use a stud finder to check where the studs are in your wall: That’s where you want to nail or otherwise affix your frames.\n\nTry and choose frames that are similar in thickness, so that none stick out from the side view.\n\nIf your wall or surface has some unusual features, like moldings or paneling (as mine does), that's okay! Just decide whether you want to use those features as borders, or whether you want to just ignore them and treat the wall as one big blank canvas. I decided to just frame over the paneling, rather than using it to break up the wall visually into sections.\n\nMixing colors and shapes to create the final effect!\n\nArt Tips\n\nWondering where to get art for your gallery wall? There are so many wonderful options online for affordable art. Personally, I love using a mix of sentimental and non-sentimental art. In my staircase, I have a gallery wall of all family photos. In this gallery wall in my bedroom, I chose all pieces of art that I found online or in shops that caught my eye or otherwise gave me good feelings. My favorite places to source art online is 20x200, Etsy, and Society6.\n\nAnother great tip (thanks to Joanna Goddard for showing me the light!) is to find really beautiful wallpaper or wrapping paper and frame squares of it. This is such a clever and affordable way to create a big, colorful statement within a frame.\n\nWhatever you go with, remember a gallery wall can be a living installation. Change it over time! Swap out pieces and photos with the seasons! With so many elements, it’s easy to refresh it bit by bit to reflect your current taste.\n\nWhere to Buy Gallery-Level Art (Without Going Broke)\nby Sean Santiago\n\nHave you ever done a gallery wall before?

          "description": "When the left engine on Southwest 1380 exploded today, a woman was nearly sucked out of the plane through the broken window next to her, other passengers on the flight told NBC. It sounds impossible, and officials haven’t yet confirmed the reports — but people have been sucked out of damaged airplanes before.\n\nThe Boeing 737’s engine exploded on Tuesday morning while the plane was flying from New York’s LaGuardia Airport to Dallas, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia. One passenger died, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in a press briefing, and the Philadelphia Fire Department reported several injuries. But NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway told The Verge in an email that he had no information about reports of a passenger being nearly pulled from the jet mid-flight.\n\nWhile fatal aircraft accidents are extremely rare, there have been cases of passengers being sucked from punctured aircraft before, says Thomas Anthony, director of the University of Southern California’s aviation safety and security program. In 1989, for example, a cargo door blew off of United Airlines flight 811 and took part of the fuselage with it: nine passengers were sucked from the plane.\n\nNTSB investigators on scene examining damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane. pic.twitter.com/2dyDzOW8pT\n\n— NTSB_Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) April 18, 2018\n\nThat can happen because the inside of the airplane is pressurized, so people can breathe even as the plane climbs to lower air pressures at higher altitudes. The pressure differences between the inside and the outside of the plane cause suction, Anthony says, which could pull a passenger from a plane if it’s punctured. The higher the plane, the bigger the pressure difference, Anthony says. “Then the more hazardous the condition is. And, certainly, the greater the hole.”\n\nThe Verge spoke with Anthony about cabin pressures, rare but fatal plane accidents, and oxygen masks.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWhat exactly does it mean when a plane depressurizes?\n\nThe term that’s used in the industry is “rapid depressurization.” The point of pressurization of an aircraft is to keep the air inside of the airplane at a level where people can breathe it comfortably. And so, in general, as you increase in altitude, the air pressure [outside] diminishes. So commercial aircraft are kept at a pressure altitude of about 8,000 feet so that people can comfortably breathe the air. When a hole is punctured, then there’s less pressure, there’s less oxygen, and that’s when the oxygen masks come down.\n\nHow does a rapid depressurization occur? Are there specific conditions when a plane is more or less likely to rapidly depressurize?\n\nWell, yes. If there is a puncture to the aluminum skin — or in the case of modern aircraft, composite skin. In the case of intentional acts of unlawful interference against aviation — namely, in the cases where bombs were placed on board aircraft — then the hole in the side of the airplane would be much greater, and, in a few cases, a person has been sucked out of the airplane.\n\nIs it different when depressurization occurs due to a small piercing like a bullet versus a large hole?\n\nYes, it’s different. Let’s say a bullet is shot. That will cause depressurization, but it would not be the same as, let’s say, a structural failure resulting in a large hole. Think about the Aloha Airlines case, where the whole top of the airplane came off. Aloha operated a fleet of aircraft — in this case, 737s — that would go from island to island. You take one tight takeoff, and one landing — so you pressurize the fuselage, and then you depressurize it.\n\nAnd because there were so many takeoffs and landings from one island to another and because it was in a warm and moist environment, there was corrosion in the top skin that formed the fuselage, and actually the top portions of the fuselage peeled back so that it looked like the top of the airplane was completely gone when it landed. There was one fatality of a flight attendant, who was sucked out of the airplane, but an amazing number of people survived that.\n\nWhat’s the safest seat to be sitting in if a plane rapidly depressurizes?\n\nI haven’t given much thought to that, but I think that it all depends on the location of the depressurization. But in general, I would say it would be that seat that is closer to the middle of the airplane, like an aisle seat [because] you’re farther from the side.\n\nHow do you breathe when the plane depressurizes before you put the mask on? Should you try to hold your breath?\n\nNo, you don’t have to hold your breath. There’s still oxygen there. You’re just absorbing less of it. What you have is a usable time of consciousness to pull the [mask] down and put it on. So no, don’t hold your breath. Just act normal, and pull it down and breathe the oxygen.\n\nIs it possible for depressurization to rip the plane apart?\n\nThat question can be answered by the fact that that phenomenon is unknown to us. So if it’s not a “no,” it’s an “approaching no” because, in my profession of studying accidents since the introduction of jet airplanes, this is not something that we have seen. So it’s extremely, extremely unlikely. [With] the Aloha flight, you’ll see that aircraft continued to a safe landing even though the top of the fuselage was gone. That speaks to the structural integrity of the aircraft.\n",

          "description": "It took Nike chemists, engineers, and designers more than three years of development before the company was ready to release its new Epic React shoes this past February. The first running shoe to combine Nike’s React cushioning platform with the company’s signature Flyknit uppers, it made for the lightest and bounciest Nike shoes yet, and gave the company a new way to compete against its biggest adversary, Adidas.\n\nAdidas had introduced its own big innovation in bouncy soles, the Boost cushioning platform, in 2012. Since, it has become one of the company’s signature products, and the focal point of Adidas’s successful UltraBoost line of running shoes, which similarly features a sock-like knit upper paired with a squishy, springy sole.\n\nThe rival shoes are so well-matched that they raise an inevitable conundrum for shoppers: Which one is better?\n\nTiffany Beers, a longtime engineer at Nike who left the company in 2017, set out to answer the question—and created a 12-point checklist that makes a pretty good guide for rating any pair of running sneakers. Her criteria include stats that affect performance, such as weight, but also things that matter to the average consumer, like price and the ease of adjusting the laces. (Obviously there would be differences if you’re comparing cushy shoes with ones that offer a barefoot feel, so adjust accordingly.)\n\nBeers know her stuff. She was the lead engineer on the project to make the self-lacing sneakers in Back to the Future II a reality in the form of the Nike Hyperadapt. She decamped from Nike to Tesla, where she worked briefly as a technical program manager, and in March launched a YouTube channel dedicated to sneakers.\n\nWhile she may not seem an impartial judge in a Nike-versus-Adidas match up, having worked at Nike for more than a decade—and during the period of React’s development—she’s quick to dole out criticism of Nike and praise for Adidas when she feels it’s deserved.\n\nSo how did the shoes stack up? Each category was worth one point. If both shoes performed equally well, they both got a point, and if they performed equally poorly in a category, neither got a point. For instance, Beers did not love the look of the midsole on either shoe. Though it’s worth noting that the UltraBoost has already had years of success as a fashion sneaker. Here’s the final tally:\n\nNike Epic React\n\nAdidas UltraBoost\n\nPrice\n\n1\n\n0\n\nAvailability\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAesthetics\n\n0\n\n0\n\nUpper comfort\n\n0\n\n1\n\nUnderfoot comfort\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTraction\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLacing system\n\n0\n\n1\n\nStability\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFit\n\n1\n\n1\n\nQuality\n\n1\n\n1\n\nDurability\n\n1\n\n1\n\nWeight\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTotal\n\n8\n\n8\n\nBeers, however, wasn’t satisfied with a tie. “This is not soccer,” she says in the video, which is worth watching for more detail on how the shoes compare in each category.\n\nThough she notes that both shoes are far superior to anything either company had put out before, she ultimately gives the win to the Nike shoe, because of its lower price—$150 for the Epic React vs. $180 for the UltraBoost—and much lighter weight. There’s an important caveat, though: Beers has only put in about 25 miles running in each so far—not even the length of a single marathon—and says more miles are needed to see how they hold up over time.\n",

          "description": "On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released its latest budget projections, predicting how much the US will tax and spend over the next 10 years.\n\nThe headline finding is rough: As a result of recent policy changes, primarily the Trump administration’s tax reforms, deficits are going to be about $1.85 trillion bigger over 10 years than previously projected, a 17.5 percent increase above what they’d be without the law. If the law’s cuts were made permanent, then the deficit would instead add another $722 billion, for a total cost of about $2.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe data gives new relevance to a debate that’s been simmering among policy-minded economists for weeks, about how serious a problem the US federal debt is and about whether the best way to tackle it is by attempting to undo the Bush and Trump tax cuts, or by taking a run at cutting Social Security and Medicare substantially.\n\nA group of conservative economists, including veterans of the Reagan, Bush I, and Bush II administrations, took to the Washington Post to make a version of the latter argument, calling the tax bill a “good first step” and “not by itself a budget buster.” The Hoover Institution’s Michael Boskin (also chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Bush I), John Cochrane, John Cogan, George Shultz (also Nixon’s Treasury secretary and Reagan’s secretary of state), and John Taylor (who served under both Bushes) argued that any deal to reduce the long-run deficit must focus on cutting “entitlements”: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans’ health care, principally.\n\nA group of liberal economists from the Clinton and Obama administrations issued a reply, acknowledging that a debt crisis could be coming, but arguing that the biggest cause is a lack of tax revenue. “There is some room for additional spending reductions in [entitlements], but not to an extent large enough to solve the long-run debt problem,” wrote Martin Neil Baily, Jason Furman, Alan Krueger, Laura Tyson, and Janet Yellen, all former Democratic chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers and, in Yellen’s case, the immediate past Fed chair.\n\nBut a growing number of left-ier economists think even that stance concedes too much, that the economy could still use a boost from federal spending, and that the conditions when a deficit hurts economic growth just don’t obtain in America in 2018. Under this perspective, the tax cuts might have been wasteful, or harmful because they encourage income inequality, but the deficits they create aren’t a serious problem at all. Nor is increasing spending on Social Security and Medicare as the baby boomers age.\n\nThe basic facts of the deficit\n\nWhile the tax bill made the deficit considerably larger, the CBO report is clear that the US would have seen large and growing deficits even without it. Since the last surpluses of the late Clinton administration, Congress has passed and, with some exceptions for the rich, made permanent two rounds of large tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003). It has financed two large-scale wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It endured the financial crisis and recession, which necessitated massive fiscal stimulus, increased the cost of safety net programs that saw greater usage, and reduced tax revenue as incomes fell.\n\nAs this classic 2013 chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, the Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic downturn accounted for basically all of the deficit by Obama’s second term in office, with the Bush tax cuts driving the lion’s share:\n\n        Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n\nIt is no longer 2013, and spending increases approved under both Trump and Obama, as well as Trump’s tax cuts, have together expanded the deficit beyond what the above projections show. But it nonetheless functions as an important account of how we got to this point.\n\nThis analysis suggests a very obvious answer to the deficit problem (if it even is a problem, about which more in a second): raise more revenue. The deficits are overwhelmingly driven by sharp reductions in revenue caused by Bush’s and Trump’s tax cuts, as well as past spending binges (principally the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) that need to be paid off. Either way, the natural response is to raise taxes and bring in more money. Just returning to the Clinton-era tax code would get you most of the way there. That’s the main conclusion of the group of Democratic economists.\n\nThe disagreement: how to handle rising health care costs and population aging\n\n        Congressional Budget Office\n\nThe problem, from the point of view of deficit hawks, is that future deficits are likely to be driven substantially by factors other than the tax cuts and wars. America is an aging country, which means that programs like Social Security and Medicare, which mostly serve the elderly, as well as programs like Medicaid that disproportionately serve the elderly, are likely to grow in size, relative to the nation’s economy. And the whole suite of government health programs, from Medicare and Medicaid to veterans’ health care to the Obamacare exchange subsidies, are likely to grow more expensive because the cost of health care has, in recent years, grown faster than inflation.\n\n        Congressional Budget Office\n\nThe latest CBO report finds that Social Security’s cost, as a share of the economy, will grow from 4.9 percent to 6 percent over the next 10 years; the cost of major health programs (Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Obamacare subsidies) will grow from 5.3 percent to 6.6 percent. Offsetting that increased cost would require 2.4 percent of GDP worth of new revenue, or $722 billion in 2028 alone. That’s more than double the annual cost of the Trump tax cuts in their first few years, before major provisions start expiring.\n\nTo conservatives, this means one thing: You have to cut entitlement programs, principally Social Security and Medicare. In practice, those programs are immensely popular, and Republican politicians typically default to targeting less universally beloved programs directed more toward the poor (like Medicaid and food stamps), but Social Security and Medicare, as the largest entitlements, have to be targeted for cuts if the goal is to balance the budget. \n\n“Taxes alone cannot solve our budget problem,” the Hoover economists write. “Funding programs as they are currently structured will require high taxes for all income levels, taxes that would sharply reduce economic opportunity and growth, which in turn will make funding entitlements that much harder.”\n\nTo liberals who are nonetheless concerned about the deficit, the diagnosis differs. Social Security and Medicare are guarantees we’ve made to seniors, and on health care, the government should be doing more, not less, to cover people. Sure, there might be savings to be had by changing how much doctors and other providers are paid, or bargaining for better prescription drug prices, but any spending cuts should be balanced, or swamped, by revenue increases necessary to pay for an aging population.\n\nThe Democratic economists write that Social Security needs “only modest reforms to restore its 75-year solvency, and these should include adjustments in both spending and revenue,” and that Medicare should focus on “reforms to payments and reformed benefit structures” rather than reducing access to care. Above all, these changes have to be paired with tax increases of a scale capable of handling rising health care costs and an aging nation.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Paul Van de Water argues that the CBO report is a cause for “concern, not alarm.” He notes that the report finds that in 2019, federal revenues will drop to 16.5 percent of GDP, “well below their 40-year average of 17.4 percent. Restoring the federal revenue base should therefore be the major goal of fiscal policy in the next few years.”\n\nShould we be worrying about deficits at all?\n\n        Congressional Budget Office\n\nVan de Water also notes that “today’s low real interest rates justify a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than was appropriate when the government faced much higher borrowing costs.” He has a point. Interest rates on government debt are at historic lows, and have been for several years now. That suggests that unlike in the 1980s and ’90s, when rates spiked over fears of inflation and out-of-control deficits (respectively), the investors financing US deficit spending aren’t really worried about it getting too high in the near future.\n\nThat raises a more fundamental question: If the bond market is almost giving money away to the US, why not take it? Why start winding down the deficit at all?\n\nThe conventional answer is to take a look at the above chart and see when the US last reached debt levels this high. Our only previous experience with debt in excess of 100 percent of GDP was in the aftermath of World War II, when the US experienced a historic growth explosion fueled in part by strong population growth and the large-scale entry of women into the workplace. Unless the US starts getting much more tolerant of immigration much more quickly, that’s not really something we can replicate. Moreover, World War II was an honest-to-God emergency, and the kind of thing large deficits exist to finance. What similar emergency justifies accumulating that much debt now?\n\nThere might be such an emergency, though: secular stagnation. The theory, popularized by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, is that for a variety of reasons, from the rise of the middle class in the developing world to population aging in the developed world to sluggish productivity growth, we are currently experiencing an excess of savings globally. There’s too much savings, and not enough genuinely productive investments in which to place it, so investors need somewhere to park their money.\n\nThat somewhere is US federal bonds. Best of all, US deficit spending should, on this theory, boost the domestic economy too, which is suffering from a chronic lack of demand and spending brought on by the excess of savings. So by continuing to run deficits and accept that money, the US is actually doing the world economy, and the US economy, a service.\n\nEven more heterodox theories, like Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), are even more skeptical of the need to tame deficits. MMT argues that because modern governments control their own currencies, they can never really “run out of money.” The reason we have taxes, then, is not to pay for stuff but to keep people using the government’s preferred currency rather than, say, bitcoin. In some rare cases, consumer demand gets too high, so sellers raise prices and inflation ensues. Then you need to raise taxes to cool down the economy. But the theory holds that this eventuality is pretty rare.\n\nStephanie Kelton, a prominent MMT economist and former staffer to Bernie Sanders, has admonished Democratic economists for conceding we need to tame long-run deficits at all. We still have plenty of fiscal room, she argues, and should be trying to expand Medicare and Social Security, not shrink them.\n\nYou don’t have to go as far as Kelton to think that concerns over deficits are overblown. Even if, in the long run, large deficits do economic harm, they have to be weighed against other concerns:\n\nThe real possibility that cutting Social Security and Medicare will meaningfully harm the well-being of seniors and disabled people on those programs\n\nThe squeeze that deficit reduction packages put on non-defense discretionary funding, which covers everything from the FBI and law enforcement to the National Institutes of Health and scientific research\n\nThe need to rebuild national infrastructure, improve water delivery, remove harmful lead pipes and lead residue from soil, build green public transit in more cities, etc., all of which is easier to do with deficit spending\n\nThe likelihood that any revenue package capable of covering our deficit will need to raise taxes on the middle class substantially in a way that could seriously depress the median American’s take-home income\n\nNone of those is a reason to ignore the deficit entirely. But each is a concern that might outweigh the need for particular kinds of deficit reduction, or might temper the urgency of deficit reduction as a goal, given other goals society has.\n",

          "description": "It’s no secret that hate crimes against Muslims have been on the rise. \n\nIn one recent incident, an anonymous group in the UK declared Tuesday, April 3, to be “Punish a Muslim Day.” They circulated leaflets in several UK cities calling for people to attack Muslims in various ways, by “using gun, knife, vehicle or otherwise,” and advocated for burning and bombing mosques.\n\nAnd in the US, studies show that in 2015 and 2016, hate crimes and attacks against Muslims skyrocketed. According to a 2017 Pew Research center analysis, which relied on FBI statistics, assaults on Muslims have “easily surpassed” post-9/11 levels. \n\nOne factor that experts often point to is the rise of Donald Trump. \n\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump made frequent use of anti-Muslim rhetoric, saying things like, “I think Islam hates us,” and suggesting that he was not opposed to the idea of a Muslim database. After taking office, Trump signed an executive order barring people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. He’s appointed people who have espoused anti-Muslim views to key Cabinet positions. And he’s even circulated anti-Muslim videos to his tens of millions of Twitter followers.  \n\nBut Khaled Beydoun, a law professor and the author of a new book called American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, argues that there’s something much more complex going on. According to Beydoun, Islamophobia — fear and hatred of Muslims and the religion of Islam — has deep roots in American history. \n\nI called Beydoun to find out more about Islamophobia in America — and what he told me was surprising. He explained that this type of racialized hatred is not limited to Muslims; it also impacts non-Muslim Arab Americans and South Asian Americans, among others. And anti-Muslim sentiment isn’t solely a problem on the right in America, he pointed out. The left also has a problem with Islamophobia.\n\nOur conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nHow would you sum up the argument of your book?\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nEssentially, it’s that even though Islamophobia animates a modern form of bigotry ... the essence of the hate is not new. It’s deeply rooted in American political discourse. It’s deeply rooted in American law. It’s deeply rooted in American framings of who was a citizen and who was not. But it’s been given a new face — a new caricature — as a consequence of the war on terror, and then intensified by the rhetoric of, mainly, President Trump.\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nYou write that Trump proved that Islamophobia was an effective campaign tactic. How has this played out during his administration? Have things gotten worse for Muslims in the US under Trump?\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump adopted this strategy of full-fledged, explicit, and bellicose rhetoric against not only Muslims but a whole range of people. \n\nI’m sure you remember pundits and analysts on television, even scholars, saying that Trump is only doing this to win the race, and that once he was actually in office he’d do away with that intense rhetoric.\n\nWe saw otherwise, obviously. Only a week into his administration, Trump signed the executive order now known as the first rendition of the Muslim ban, or the travel ban. What many thought was mere rhetoric to mobilize voters quickly evolved — or devolved —  into Islamophobic policy during the early stages of his presidency.\n\nHe weaponized that rhetoric into real policy impacting Muslim communities.\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about how Islamophobia is particularly strong among right-wing US politicians, but you point out that it’s also very present on the left.\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nYeah, definitely. Islamophobia, largely on account of it being so closely tied and tethered to Trump, is caricatured as exclusively a form of hate that comes from people on the right. We almost conflate Islamophobia with right-wing politics, which is really simplistic. It glosses over the idea that you have individuals on the left engaging in and propagating Islamophobia.\n\nPresident Obama established this state-sponsored program called Countering Violent Extremism. As a consequence of this program, his surveillance of Muslim communities actually was broader and more intense than the Bush administration — and Obama was lauded as one of the most, if not the most, progressive presidents in our country’s history.\n\nAnother example are popular media personalities and pundits like Bill Maher. I was a fan of his show, Real Time With Bill Maher, and I sometimes still find myself watching it because it’s a space for really vibrant and important discussion on a range of issues. Bill Maher is somebody who is very left-wing on a range of issues, like the LGBTQ community and the environment. \n\nBut he veers entirely away from that when it comes to Muslims and Islamophobia, and espouses this clash of civilizations, this narrow view of Islam as being a faith that is entirely antithetical to the West — that Muslims are a pariah that need to be policed and dealt with by the state.\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nYou also say in the book that it’s not just Muslims who have been targeted. Talk more about what you mean.\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nWhen we think about Islamophobia and who it victimizes, it’s important to be nuanced. So your average Joe and Jane living down the street who might be ignorant or misinformed about Islam, who adopt a racialized view of who Muslims are, these are private Islamophobes. Private Islamophobes can victimize and target non-Muslims.\n\nA quintessential example is Balbir Singh [Sodhi], a man who was killed in Arizona in September 2001. He was a gas station owner, a Sikh man who had a turban and a beard, and he was the first post-9/11 hate crime, or hate murder. \n\nHe wasn’t a Muslim, but because Sikh men fit within this racialized caricature some people have of Muslims, they can be victims to private Islamophobia. Obviously there are South Asian men who are Hindu or Christian or atheist or agnostic. On the West Coast, a lot of Latino men kind of fit within the physical caricature of how people perceive Muslim men.\n\nThe state, whether it be the federal government or even local government, is different. They have a more nuanced and developed understanding of Islam as a consequence of 9/11. They know, I think, at this juncture, based on the war on terror mandate, that Muslims are racially diverse and ethnically diverse, diverse in regard to ideology, and so on.\n\n        Courtesy of Khaled Beydoun\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nYou mention Black Lives Matter in the book. How does Islamophobia affect a group like Black Lives Matter? How would you connect those two?\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nIslamophobia intersects with Black Lives Matter in dynamic and distinct ways. A large number of African Americans are Muslim; we know that anywhere between 25 and 33 percent of the entire Muslim population here, in the states, [is] black. When we think about violent policing, we think about these issues that the Black Lives Matter movement has committed to addressing and dismantling.\n\nI think it’s also important to frame Islamophobia as another aspect of white supremacy. Specifically, war on terror programming, when we think about the state-sponsored Islamophobic programs that I talk about in the book, whether it be counter-radicalization in the Patriot Act, the Muslim ban, and so on. \n\nThese are also tools that are tied to white supremacy. The ultimate, primary objective of Black Lives Matter is to dismantle and do away with white supremacist structures and policies from the state, and that is also the objective of a movement that’s looking to do away with structural Islamophobia. \n\nThe victims of Islamophobia, racist policing, the school-to-prison pipeline and so on, can be black Muslims, they can be Latino Muslims, they can be indigent and working-class Muslims. It’s important to frame that these movements intersect and that they converge in really dynamic ways.\n\nAlexia Underwood\n\nDo you see these movements working together to combat this type of discrimination?\n\nKhaled Beydoun\n\nOne of the positive developments in the context of this current, intense moment is that Islamophobia has become a mainstream social justice issue.\n\nIt’s something that Muslims, but also non-Muslims, are talking about. I’m doing these talks at universities, and you can talk to, for example, a Chinese-American undergraduate at UCLA who knows what Islamophobia is, who has a nuanced understanding that it’s being extended by the state, and it’s been unleashed by private individuals. \n\nThat, to me, is really eye-opening, and I think it marks progress. It foreshadows, I think, even greater strides being made in the future — the idea that there’s a whole range of new communities that are mobilized and committed to fighting Islamophobia in all of its forms.\n\nA second thing is that Muslim America right now has a sizable and growing crop of leadership. Leadership that are really fluent and literate in the language of racial and social justice. I think that’s partly a credit to the Black Lives Matter movement, to be frank with you. I think a lot of younger-generation Muslim-American leaders were really politically empowered, mobilized by the BLM movement. \n\nSo I want readers to understand that Islamophobia is comprehensive: that it’s not only this form of hate and violence coming from individuals on the fringe. It’s far more complex than that. It’s important to see that it’s something that is spearheaded by state policy, and that it’s deeply entrenched, it’s deeply rooted. It’s not a new phenomenon.\n\nI also think it’s a cornerstone racial justice issue, and I hope that that commitment [to fighting Islamophobia] doesn’t fade away when Trump steps down.\n",

Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), would loosen or eliminate restrictions on height, density, parking and design for residential properties near major rail and bus stops.\n\nThe impact could be huge. A Times analysis found that about 190,000 parcels in L.A. neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes are located in the “transit rich” areas identified in SB 827. Residences in those neighborhoods could eventually be replaced with buildings ranging from 45 to 85 feet, city officials say.\n\n“While we are still evaluating the full effects of the bill, close to 50% of the city’s single-family homes would be impacted under SB 827,” said Yeghig L. Keshishian, spokesman for the Department of City Planning.\n\nThat is from Zahniser, Dillon, and Schleuss at the LA Times.  Via Matt Yglesias, who adds:\n\nNote that ecologically the big #SB827 win isn’t even about transit-oriented development. California’s mild climate and low-carbon electricity mix make it one of the greenest places in America, so more houses in California is an environmental win.\n\nIt is time for this referendum to translate into larger excitement at the national level, as say Proposition 13 once did and some of the marijuana referenda have done as well.\n\nHere is a thread on real estate in the Bay Area, worst is maybe Menlo Park.\n\nThe post How much more can be built in Los Angeles? appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "I’ve learned a lot about industrial organization watching The Profit, a reality-TV show on CNBC featuring businessman Marcus Lemonis. In each episode Lemonis buys into a failing small-to-medium-sized business and works to turn it around. Lemonis doesn’t invest in a random sample of businesses nor even in a random sample of failing businesses. Nevertheless, the lessons that The Profit teaches are consistent with the new literature on management which has increased my confidence both in the show and the literature.\n\nIn the perfectly competitive model, price is equal to average cost and firms operate efficiently at minimum cost. Yet, Syverson finds that in the typical US industry a firm at the 90th percentile of the productivity distribution makes almost twice as much output with the same inputs as a firm at the 10th percentile. It’s not easy to measure inputs or outputs, of course, but even firms producing very uniform products show big productivity differences.\n\nHow can firms that use inputs so inefficiently survive? In part, competition is imperfect which gives inefficient firms a cushion because they can charge a price higher than cost even as costs are higher than necessary. Another reason is that small firms eat their costs.\n\nA typical firm on The Profit, for example, has decent revenues, sometimes millions of dollars of revenues, but it has costs that are as high or higher. What happened? Often the firm began with a competitive advantage–a product that took off unexpectedly and so for a time the firm was rolling in profits without having to pay much attention to costs. As competition slowly took hold, however, margins started to decline and the firm found itself bailing. But instead, of going out of business, the firm covers its losses with entrepreneurs and family members who work without pay, with loans which grow ever larger, and by an occasional demand shock which generates enough surplus revenue to just keep going.\n\nThe correct metaphor for competition isn’t a boxing match that knocks out the inefficient firm. The correct metaphor is a slow tide. Inefficient firms must scramble for a bit of high ground but as the tide ebbs and flows they can occasionally catch a breath when their head bobs above the profit line. An inefficient firm can survive for years before it inevitably sinks.\n\nThe second lesson from The Profit is that management matters and it matters in systematic and fairly easy to replicate ways. If mis-measurement explained productivity differences, Lemonis would not be able to successfully turn firms around. But he can and does. How?\n\nOne of the first things Lemonis does in almost every episode is get the numbers right so he can calculate which products are selling and which have the highest price-to-cost margin. Concentrate production on high-margin, big sellers. Drop the rest. Simple; but many firms don’t know their numbers.\n\nSecond, in episode after episode, Lemonis cleans up shop. Literally. He cleans the shop floor and gets rid of inventory that isn’t selling. He then arranges the floor to improve process flow (made easier by concentrating production on fewer products). He then creates an inventory system, tracks orders and the inputs needed to create those orders, and takes advantage of costs savings through economies of scale in input purchases.\n\nCan it be so simple? To be sure, Lemonis is a smart guy but very little of what he does takes genius. We know this because we now have robust evidence from India and Mexico that better management increases profits and productivity and that such increases can be sustained over the long run. In the studies from India and Mexico, randomly selected firms were given access to a “management intervention” and their productivity and profits improved and stayed higher for years after the intervention ended.\n\nMoreover, what were these management interventions? Did some bright Harvard grad recommend a complicated swap-options deal? A new chemical process? A new management form? No. By and large, the interventions were simple. Just like the Lemonis interventions.\n\nHere, for example, are some pictures of the storage systems used in the Indian textile firms which were part of the management study (from Nick Bloom’s slides). This is exactly the kind of thing one sees on the Profit and the recommendations to create an inventory control system are exactly the same. Management 101.\n\nThis is the sense in which the lessons of The Profit are consistent with the new literature on management and increase confidence in both.\n\nAnother lesson from The Profit is that firm problems are personal problems. The son who can’t step out from the shadow of the father and the father who can’t let go. The two brothers who haven’t gotten over the death of their father and the problems this creates in the firm they have inherited. The siblings who are still fighting to get their parent’s attention. If Lemonis has a genius skill it’s in keeping his temper and working through bullshit problems to get to the real festering issues that are at the root of inefficiencies.\n\nNow, in this case, there is surely some selection going on. Personal drama makes for good television but the general point strikes me as true and correct and important. It’s difficult to run a business like a business. The analytical mindset that can separate business problems from personal problems isn’t natural. Many people cannot separate business decisions from their own preferences and emotional biases, which is one reason why great business leaders are rare.\n\nI’ve learned a lot about IO from watching The Profit but could business people learn about running a firm by seeing more reality-TV? Robin Hanson argues:\n\nIf one can learn….from just watching the inside story of real firms over several years, that suggests a big win: record the full lives of many rising managers over several years, and show a mildly compressed and annotated selection of such recordings to aspiring managers.\n\nI agree with Robin, Reality-TV MBAs could offer a lot of value. The Profit is a good place to start.\n\nThe post Lessons from “The Profit” appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

          "description": "You’ve been in your job at work for a few years, and for almost as long you’ve been angling for a promotion to a higher position. One day the desired slot opens up, and your boss calls you into his office to let you know you’ve got the job. You’re excited, of course. As you should be! But you also feel a bit of trepidation. Even though you’ve thought a lot about getting this promotion, you haven’t really thought much about the reality of what your new position will entail. How will you handle it, particularly being put over folks who used to be your peers? You’ll be managing the folks you used to complain with; you might now be “the man” that folks want to complain about.\n\nMany promotions mean moving up a corporate ladder and managing people you previously worked with on the same level. That’s just how business hierarchies work. Even if you were already a manager, maybe you moved up a rung and are now leading other managers. No matter the scenario, there’s often some awkwardness and politics to navigate.\n\n(Granted, that’s not all promotions. Sometimes you just get a new title, a salary boost, and some new responsibilities, without moving into a new management role. In those cases, your transition is probably a little more straightforward.)\n\nIf you’re in a new position where you’re being asked to oversee your former peers and/or current friends, here are a few tips on how to handle that transition smoothly and successfully:\n\nCelebrate! (But Quietly)\n\nYou’ve earned a promotion! Huzzah! You should rightly celebrate. Get yourself a new suit or briefcase, go out to a fancy restaurant with your family and/or friends, and take some time to appreciate that your hard work paid off.\n\nBut, don’t do those things in front of your coworkers (possibly now your subordinates). Take a pass on the victory lap around the office and the shouts of “Yippee! Suck it, losers!” Wear your new suit to work, of course, but don’t brag about it as a prize to yourself for getting promoted. Don’t mention to your office mates that you had the most expensive, best tasting steak in the world last night. Play it cool, man. Rubbing it in their face, especially if it’s someone you don’t really like, might be exactly what you want to do, but won’t get you started on the right foot in your new position.\n\nAcknowledge the Change\n\nJust because you won’t celebrate your promotion in the face of your coworkers doesn’t mean it has to go totally unacknowledged. It’s not a bad idea to briefly meet face-to-face with the folks you now manage and have a conversation about what the relationship might look like moving forward. You might say something like:\n\n“Of course things are a little different now, but, as your manager, I want nothing more than for you to succeed. Don’t hesitate to come to me with any issues you might have; my goal is to provide you with training, skills, oversight, and an environment that promotes your own success here. Here’s my vision for our team and how we’ll operate . . . Do you have questions or concerns right off the bat? Are there any changes you’d like to see made in how things are run?”\n\nOperate With a Clean Slate\n\nIf you’re now managing some of the people with whom you were once equal peers, it might be hard to forget some of the shenanigans they participated in: the company-sponsored networking event where Bill had a few too many drinks; the time Rob called in sick, but you know he was really just at home watching March Madness (and texting you the whole time).\n\nNow that you’re managing these people, what do you do? The best tactic is to wipe the slate clean of any past misdeeds. That doesn’t mean looking the other way in the face of future poor etiquette or the breaking of company rules, but it does mean you should forgive and forget things that might have happened before you entered your new role.\n\nYou Have More Responsibility Now; Act Like It\n\nWhile a promotion sure enough means a salary boost and sometimes a new office that’s all yours, it also means greater responsibility. You might now have access to more sensitive information, or even just greater access to higher level folks in the company. You’re probably being watched a bit more by both your superiors (not micromanaged necessarily, but in a “can he handle this?” sort of way) and those you’re now in charge of.\n\nIf you used to regularly be 5-10 minutes late, make it a habit to be 5-10 minutes early instead. If you used to commiserate with your peers about lame company policies or engage in gossip about your coworkers, make it a point to stay away from those conversations. In a higher level position, your example means a whole lot more. If you’re occasionally showing up late or gossiping, people will take that to mean that it’s okay to do those things.\n\nAlso be sure you aren’t sharing privileged information with those who aren’t privy to it. Maybe you now know the CEO’s salary, or you found out some weird quirk of his that would make your buddies laugh — hold it in. Take the responsibility of the new position seriously.\n\nDon’t Be Hurt If You’re Treated Differently . . .  \n\nIt’s inevitable that your relationship will change with your former work pals when you’ve been promoted, especially if you’re now directly managing them. Don’t be surprised if you aren’t invited to happy hour, or if breakroom conversation lulls when you show up. There’s a power dynamic in place that just can’t be ignored; your old pals don’t want to put themselves in any sort of compromising position. It’s a hard truth, but something you’ll just have to accept. You don’t want to be the supervisor who desperately wants back in with his old crew.\n\nYour interactions might be a little more stilted, but if you work at making everyone feel comfortable and like they’re heard, you can maintain the good relationships you had before, albeit with slightly different dynamics.\n\n. . . In Fact, You Should Establish Some Boundaries\n\nEven if your coworkers are okay with you still joining them at the water cooler or going out to eat together for lunch, it might be a good idea to intentionally remove yourself — at least a little bit — from those scenarios. If you’re now the boss, maintaining a relationship that’s purely friendly won’t lend you the authority to deal with problems when they come up, be they minor things (like subordinates taking slightly long lunch breaks) or serious (like needing to fire them). Your leadership in general can come in to question if your relationship doesn’t change in the least bit.\n\nIf you disengage from casual chit-chat, and say yes to fewer lunch invitations, you’ll start to cultivate that air of authority that you may need in your new position. It’s not necessarily fun, but again, just comes with the territory of having more responsibility. Embrace the change, and take it as a chance to expand your social life outside the office. Workplace friendships are great at times (in fact you need a work pal!), but don’t tend to be the longest-lasting or most meaningful.\n\nNow, if you’ve been promoted to a different division or office and you aren’t directly overseeing the people you once worked with, there’s nothing wrong with maintaining those relationships as you did before.\n\nMake Changes Slowly\n\nIf you’ve been promoted, it might be because you’ve had some great ideas that have been implemented, and you have even more in this new position about how things should operate. Be careful about changing things too quickly though. Even if some systems and processes are outdated, you don’t want to change up how things have been going for years and years until you’ve been in your new position for a little while. For the new guy on the job to make wholesale fixes will seem foolhardy to others — like you don’t have enough experience to fully appreciate what’s going on. And really, that’s true. Problems will often look different from the inside than they did from the outside; you’ll find out some nuances and complexities you formerly weren’t privy to.\n\nSo take some time to get the lay of the land and get used to your new position before you go about making big, sweeping changes. When you do, it’ll seem more measured rather than an impulsive need to change things for the sake of changing things.\n\nYou don’t want to step on any toes or damage any relationships before you even get started.\n\nLearn What You Have Yet to Learn\n\nChances are good that as you move into a new role, you’ll realize you have a lot to learn. You were likely in your old position for at least a couple years, and in that time, you came to know your daily processes and the ins and outs of your job like the back of your hand. You just intuitively get into a real groove after a period of time, and you’ve likely forgotten how much you had to learn and how rough the going was at the very start.\n\nNow in a new role, even within the same company, you’re sort of starting from scratch again. You have new systems to learn, new supervisors to get in sync with, and most likely, new skills and managerial techniques to hone. \n\nEspecially if you’re brand new to managing people, you’ll need to learn how your team works best and what motivates them, both individually and as a cohesive unit. You’ll also need to bone up on conflict resolution, negotiation, delegation, etc. This is another reason you don’t want to make sweeping changes right off the bat; you may have a lot to learn, especially about how your team operates, and you don’t want to jump the gun before you have enough facts or skills under your belt.\n\nAct Like You Belong\n\nWhen you’re promoted, even if you’ve worked hard at getting there, it can feel like you don’t quite belong — like you’re faking it or pulling one over on your higher-ups. The reality, though, is that you did work hard, and you were chosen for a promotion for a reason. Don’t be timid or demure about the new role; act like you belong there. Fake it until you make it, and assume the mask of command.\n\nConsider even changing your style to reflect the new position. Maybe in your old role you wore the classic office uniform of khakis and a polo or long-sleeve button-up shirt. Now that you’re moving up the ladder, consider subtly upping your wardrobe a level as well, even and especially if you don’t have to. Add a blazer or two to the mix, level up your shoes and other accessories, and heck, even wear a suit now and then (as long as a suit is just one notch or so above what everyone else is wearing; you don’t want to rock one when the workplace uniform is jeans and a polo; in that case, know how to rock a sports jacket with jeans).\n\nYour new duds will not only function as a signal of authority to others, but to yourself as well, helping you psychologically step into your new role and key into a more confident mindset.\n\nMentor Your Subordinates\n\nSupport the people under you as much as possible and help them get better at their jobs. Take the time to teach; don’t just tell them what to do, but show them how to do it, and explain why they do it. Offer praise, both privately and publicly. Listen to their ideas, and if they’re good, pass them on to your own supervisor.\n\nSuch mentorship benefits your subordinates, but it benefits you too; the higher-ups won’t likely give you another promotion until they feel confident someone in your department is ready to take your place. As you help those under you move up, you help yourself move up too!\n\nThe post How to Be Manager to Your Friends and Peers appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",

          "description": "The story of Windows’ decline is relatively straightforward and a classic case of disruption:\n\nThe Internet dramatically reduced application lock-in\n\nPCs became “good enough”, elongating the upgrade cycle\n\nSmartphones first addressed needs the PC couldn’t, then over time started taking over PC functionality directly\n\nWhat is more interesting, though, is the story of Windows’ decline in Redmond, culminating with last week’s reorganization that, for the first time since 1980, left the company without a division devoted to personal computer operating systems (Windows was split, with the core engineering group placed under Azure, and the rest of the organization effectively under Office 365; there will still be Windows releases, but it is no longer a standalone business). Such a move didn’t seem possible a mere five years ago, when, in the context of another reorganization, former-CEO Steve Ballmer wrote a memo insisting that Windows was the future (emphasis mine):\n\nIn the critical choice today of digital ecosystems, Microsoft has an unmatched advantage in work and productivity experiences, and has a unique ability to drive unified services for everything from tasks and documents to entertainment, games and communications. I am convinced that by deploying our smart-cloud assets across a range of devices, we can make Windows devices once again the devices to own. Other companies provide strong experiences, but in their own way they are each fragmented and limited. Microsoft is best positioned to take advantage of the power of one, and bring it to our over 1 billion users.\n\nThat memo prompted me to write a post entitled Services, Not Devices that argued that Ballmer’s strategic priorities were exactly backwards: Microsoft’s services should be businesses in their own right, not Windows’ differentiators. Ballmer, though, followed-through on his memo by buying Nokia; it speaks to Microsoft’s dysfunction that he was allowed to spend billions on a deal that allegedly played a large role in his ouster.\n\nThat dysfunction was The Curse of Culture:\n\nCulture is not something that begets success, rather, it is a product of it. All companies start with the espoused beliefs and values of their founder(s), but until those beliefs and values are proven correct and successful they are open to debate and change. If, though, they lead to real sustained success, then those values and beliefs slip from the conscious to the unconscious, and it is this transformation that allows companies to maintain the “secret sauce” that drove their initial success even as they scale. The founder no longer needs to espouse his or her beliefs and values to the 10,000th employee; every single person already in the company will do just that, in every decision they make, big or small.\n\n As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction. More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need to do so.\n\nThus my assertion at the top, that the story of how Microsoft came to accept the reality of Windows’ decline is more interesting than the fact of Windows’ decline; this is how CEO Satya Nadella convinced the company to accept the obvious.\n\nThe Easy Win: Office on iPad\n\nA month after taking over as CEO, Nadella introduced Office for iPad. Quite obviously, given the timing, the work had been done under Ballmer; some reports suggest the initiative in fact started years previously. Ballmer, though, wouldn’t release it until there was a touch version for Windows 8; some wonder if he would have ever released it at all.\n\nIt’s all a bit of a moot point; in the end Ballmer’s delay gave Nadella an easy win that symbolized the exact shift in mindset Microsoft needed: non-Windows platforms would be targets for Microsoft services, not competitors for Windows.\n\nThat wasn’t the only news that week: Microsoft also renamed its cloud service from Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure. The name change was an obvious one — by then customers could already run a whole host of non-Windows related software, including Linux — but the symbolism tied in perfectly with the Office on iPad announcement: Windows wouldn’t be forced onto Microsoft’s future.\n\nThe Demotion: Nadella’s First Strategy Memo\n\nIt was another three months before Nadella wrote his first company-wide strategy memo explicitly departing from his predecessor:\n\nMore recently, we have described ourselves as a “devices and services” company. While the devices and services description was helpful in starting our transformation, we now need to hone in on our unique strategy. At our core, Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will reinvent productivity to empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more.\n\nWhat is striking about this articulation of “productivity and platforms” is that it is exactly how Nadella reorganized the company last week; the “Experiences & Devices” team is focused on end-user productivity, while the “Cloud + AI” team is all about building the platform of the future. The reason it took so long is the point of this article — Nadella had a Windows problem.\n\nTo that end, the most important aspect of Nadella’s memo was not what he said about Windows, but where he said it. I wrote in a Daily Update breaking down the memo:\n\nTrust me when I say demoting Windows all the way to this point in the letter is a dramatic shift. Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Steve Ballmer said “Nothing is More Important at Microsoft than Windows”; Nadella not even mentioning the OS for the first 2,000 words sends a very different message. Similarly, spending nothing more than a sentence on Surface and Nokia — in the entire email, the word “Surface” appears twice and “Nokia” once — makes it as clear as can be that neither is the future.\n\nThis was the next step after the initial symbolism of Office on iPad and the Azure name change: actually articulating a future where Windows didn’t matter.\n\nThe Retreat: Love Windows\n\nNadella, though, had a short-term problem: Microsoft’s most important customers — enterprises — hated Windows 8. The operating system may not have been Microsoft’s future, but it was still a massive cash cow, and the linchpin for all of Microsoft’s legacy products. To that end the company needed Windows 10 to get out the door sooner-rather-than-later.\n\nThis, I think, is the context for Nadella’s presentation at a January, 2015 event about Windows 10; Nadella said:\n\nWe absolutely believe that Windows is home for the very best of Microsoft experiences. There’s nothing subtle about this strategy. It’s a practical approach which is customer first. We want to give ourselves the best opportunity to serve our customers everywhere and give ourselves the best chance to help customers find Windows as their home. That’s what we plan to do…We need to move from people needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows…We want to make Windows 10 the most loved release of Windows.\n\nAt the time I was very disappointed; suggesting that Microsoft experiences needed to be “best” on Windows suggested that Windows was dictating the direction of Microsoft services. A few months later, though, once Windows 10 shipped, Nadella made clear this was only a temporary retreat.\n\nThe Quarantine: Nadella’s First Reorganization\n\nThat summer Nadella undertook his first reorganization, separating the company into three divisions: Cloud and Enterprise, Applications and Services, and Windows and Devices. I wrote in a Daily Update:\n\nThis explicitly undoes Ballmer’s ill-considered reorganization from a divisional company to an allegedly functional organization. At the time Ballmer wrote:\n\nWe are rallying behind a single strategy as one company — not a collection of divisional strategies…\n\n This was exactly wrong: by that point Microsoft had already lost the devices war and needed to focus on services that worked on iOS and Android. A “One Microsoft” strategy, on the other hand, kept all of those services subservient to Windows. However, with this new reorganization, Windows is off in the corner where it belongs, leaving the Cloud and Enterprise team and Applications and Services Group free to focus on building their businesses on top of all platforms.\n\nI believe this reorganization was the turning point: not only were the two teams Nadella announced last week basically formed at this time, but more importantly, Windows was left to fend for itself.\n\nThe Inception: The Death of Windows Phone\n\nNadella’s most impressive bit of jujitsu was how he killed Windows Phone; while the platform had obviously been dead in the water for years, Nadella didn’t imperiously axe the program. Instead, by isolating Windows, he let the division’s leadership come to that conclusion on their own.\n\nNaturally, departing Windows-head Terry Myerson blamed the rest of the company, stating, “When I look back on our journey in mobility, we’ve done hard work and had great ideas, but have not always had the alignment needed across the company to make an impact.” I wrote at the time:\n\nThis is such an utterly clueless explanation of why Windows Phone failed that it’s kind of stunning. Until, of course, you remember the culture-induced myopia I described yesterday: Myerson still has the Ballmer-esque presumption that Microsoft controlled its own destiny and could have leveraged its assets (like Office) to win the smartphone market, ignoring that by virtue of being late Windows Phone was a product competing against ecosystems, which meant no consumer demand, which meant no developers, topped off by the arrogance to dictate to OEMs and carriers what they could and could not do to the phone, destroying any chance at leveraging distribution to get critical mass…\n\n Interestingly, though, Myerson’s ridiculous assertion in a roundabout way shows how you change culture…In this case, Nadella effectively shunted Windows to its own division with all of the company’s other non-strategic assets, leaving Myerson and team to come to yesterday’s decision on their own. Remember, Nadella opposed the Nokia acquisition, but instead of simply dropping the axe on day one, thus wasting precious political capital, he hung the Windows team out to dry let Windows give it their best shot and come to that conclusion on their own.\n\nNadella did the same thing with Windows proper: when Windows 10 launched Myerson claimed that the operating system would be on 1 billion devices by mid-2018; the company had to walk that back a year later, not because Nadella said so, but because the market did.\n\nThe Division: The End of Windows\n\nAnd so we reach last week’s announcements: the Windows division is no more. It is an incredibly meaningful milestone, yet anticlimactic at the same time, thanks to Nadella’s careful management. It is worth noting, though, that Nadella had one critical ally in this journey: Wall Street.\n\nMicrosoft’s stock price since Satya Nadella became CEO.\n\nIf culture flows from success, then it follows that an attempt to change culture is far easier to accomplish when the most obvious indicator of success — one that has a direct impact on employee pocket-books — is moving up-and-to-the-right. What is fascinating to consider, though, is that Microsoft’s stock is up not only because the company has a vision that it is delivering on quarter-after-quarter, but also because the stock was depressed in the first place.\n\nTo put it another way, Nadella’s shift to a post-Windows Microsoft is the right one; to have done the same a decade sooner would have been better. It also, though, may have been impossible, simply because Windows was still the biggest part of the business, and it’s not clear the markets would have tolerated an explicit shift before it was painfully obvious it was necessary; without a rising stock price, Nadella’s mission would have been much more challenging if not impossible.\n\nThe Future: Why Microsoft?\n\nIt’s important to note that Windows persisted as the linchpin of Microsoft’s strategy for over three decades for a very good reason: it made everything the company did possible. Windows had the ecosystem and the lock-in, and provided the foundation for Office and Windows Server, both of which were built with the assumption of Windows at the center.\n\nOffice 365 and Azure are comparatively weaker strategically: Office 365 has document lock-in, but the exact same forces that weakened Windows in the first place weaken the idea of documents as well. It’s not clear why new companies in particular would even care. Azure, meanwhile, is chasing AWS, with a huge amount of business coming from Linux VMs that could run anywhere.\n\nUnsurprisingly, both are still benefiting from Windows: Office 365 really does, as Nadella noted in his retreat, work better on Windows, and vice versa; it is seamless for organizations that have been using Office for years to move to Office 365. Azure’s biggest advantage, meanwhile, is that it allows for hybrid deployments, where workloads are split between legacy on-premise Windows servers and Azure’s public cloud; that legacy was built on Windows.\n\nThis, then, is Nadella’s next challenge: to understand that Windows is not and will not drive future growth is one thing; identifying future drivers of said growth is another. Even in its division Windows remains the best thing Microsoft has going — it had such a powerful hold on Microsoft’s culture precisely because it was so successful.",

          "description": "Fifty years ago, on April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. The murder of the civil-rights advocate at age 39 rocked a country where memories of the slayings of John F. Kennedy and Malcolm X remained fresh. And just months later, Robert F. Kennedy would be gunned down in Los Angeles.\n\nKing’s murder fueled decades of conspiracy theories and allegations of a government coverup from those who believe James Earl Ray, the man who initially confessed, couldn’t have acted alone. The doubts had echoes of those that surround JFK’s killing to this day: Was Ray a lone gunman on a self-propelled mission? Or the unfortunate patsy in a massive conspiracy?\n\nFive decades later, according to some of those closest to the case—including King’s own family—the question of exactly what happened on the second-floor balcony of the Lorraine Motel that April 4 has still not been definitively answered.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s mission in Memphis\n\nKing was in Memphis to support the city’s striking sanitation workers ahead of a march he was planning in Washington on behalf of poor Americans. He delivered what was to be his final speech at the Mason Temple Church in Memphis on April 3, the night before he was killed, with words that eerily foreshadowed his death:\n\nJust after 6pm the next day, King was hit in the neck by a single bullet at the Lorraine, where he was known to stay when visiting the city. He was pronounced dead at St. Joseph’s Hospital about an hour later.\n\nCoretta Scott King with children Yolanda, Bernice, Martin III, and Dexter at King’s funeral on April 7, 1968. (Associated Press)\nJames Earl Ray’s capture and confession\n\nFingerprints on a rifle, scope, and pair of binoculars found near the scene, as well as in the bathroom of a boarding house across the street from the Lorraine—from which police believed the shot had been fired—matched a single suspect: James Earl Ray.\n\nFBI poster for James Earl Ray.\nRay was a low-level criminal on the run after escaping from a Missouri prison in 1967 while serving time for a holdup. Many of the basic facts lined up: Ray had purchased a Remington .30-06 Gamemaster rifle (the same make and model used to kill King) in Birmingham, Alabama six days prior, and had been renting a room in the Memphis boarding house under an alias at the time of the murder.\n\nAn international manhunt led to his arrest in London at Heathrow Airport on June 8, 1968. Ten months later, Ray pleaded guilty to assassinating King to avoid the death penalty. He signed a detailed confession.\n\nRay was sentenced to 99 years in prison and because of the guilty plea, no testimony ever was heard in court. (Ray and seven other inmates escaped from prison for three days in June 1977. He received an additional year on his sentence).\n\nAllegations of a conspiracy\n\nThree days after his guilty plea, Ray tried to recant his confession, saying he was the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy and that his lawyer had coerced him into pleading guilty.\n\nRay said that while on the run in Montreal in 1967, a man he knew only as “Raoul” lured him into a small gun-running scheme, and instructed him to buy the rifle in Birmingham as well as rent the room in the Memphis boarding house. Ray claims to have given Raoul the rifle before the King murder, and other than that, had no involvement in the assassination. He says he had no prior knowledge of any plot to kill King.\n\nRay’s motion was denied, as were his many other requests for a retrial over the next 29 years, before he died in prison in 1998.\n\nA 1977 US House Select Committee investigation put forth the theory that Ray assassinated King in the hope of collecting a reward from the supporters of then-presidential candidate George Wallace, though there was little supporting evidence.\n\nJohn Campbell, district attorney for Shelby County in Tennessee, spent years investigating the case and is certain of Ray’s guilt. “I’m not saying he didn’t have help. But he didn’t have the FBI, the CIA, the Memphis police or the mafia,” he told the Washington Post in March.\n\nThe King family and their doubts\n\nThe FBI took the lead in the investigation of King’s murder, which became the primary basis for his family’s distrust of the official version events.\n\nThe agency had spent the previous decade working to discredit King and his supporters through constant surveillance, disinformation, harassment, and even open criticism from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Given this history, King’s family maintains the FBI couldn’t have led a unbiased investigation, alleging at the very least negligence, and at the very most a government conspiracy and coverup.\n\nDexter King meeting James Earl Ray in prison in 1997. (Associated Press/The State of Tennessee, Earl Warren)\nIn 1997, King’s son Dexter met with Ray in prison. “I just want to ask you, for the record, did you kill my father?” Dexter asked. “No, no, I didn’t, no. But like I say, sometimes these questions are difficult to answer, and you have to make a personal evaluation,” Ray responded, hinting at a possible conspiracy. King told reporters he and his family believed Ray’s story and supported his efforts for a retrial.\n\nAfter Ray’s death in 1998, Coretta Scott lamented that “America will never have the benefit of Mr. Ray’s trial, which would have produced new revelations about the assassination…as well as establish the facts concerning Mr. Ray’s innocence.”\n\nKing’s surviving children aren’t in total agreement about the true nature of their father’s death (whether they believe Ray’s story, Jowers’ confession, or something else entirely), but all of them say they are certain Ray didn’t fire the gun that killed King.\n\nCoretta Scott King vs. Loyd Jowers\n\nThe FBI maintains its original conclusion and denies all allegations of a conspiracy or coverup, but unanswered questions still linger about King’s final moments and details of the investigation.\n\nFor instance, witnesses (including a New York Times reporter) reported seeing a man in the bushes beneath the boarding-house bathroom, but for some unknown reason, Memphis Public Works cut down the bushes the next day, destroying any potential crime scene. King’s usual Memphis Police security detail was also mysteriously withdrawn on the day of the assassination.\n\nThen, there is Loyd Jowers, owner of a bar on the first floor of the boarding house, who told ABC-TV’s Primetime Live in 1993 that he had been involved in a conspiracy to kill King that involved organized crime and the US government. Jowers said he hired a crooked Memphis police lieutenant to commit the murder as a favor to a local mobster friend and was paid $100,000.\n\nCoretta Scott King takes the witness stand during a 1997 hearing to reopen the investigation into her husband’s murder. (Reuters/Jeff Mitchell US)\nIn 1999, the family filed suit against Jowers, seeking to get more information into the public record. After hearing four weeks of testimony from over 70 witnesses, a Shelby County jury unanimously found Jowers and unnamed “others, including governmental agencies,” responsible for King’s death. The verdict didn’t change much, however, as the civil suit didn’t reverse Ray’s conviction and the King family had only sought a symbolic $100 in damages as proof they weren’t motivated by financial gain.\n\nThe trial “relied heavily on second- and third-hand accounts,” the Los Angeles Times reported, and both the jurors and judge (a year away from retirement) dozed off during testimony. Jowers never took the stand and only provided his account in depositions and unsworn video statements.\n\nPartly based on Jowers’ claim, the King family successfully petitioned the administration of president Bill Clinton to have the US Justice Department reopen the case in 1998. The subsequent investigation led to the same conclusion as the original: Ray alone was guilty of the murder and there was no conspiracy.\n\nBarry Kowalski, the civil-rights special counsel who led the federal investigation, said that Jowers had repeatedly changed his story and wasn’t credible. It was also revealed that Jowers had confessed to fabricating his claim in the hopes of receiving a $300,000 book deal.\n\n“Our thorough investigation,” Kowalski said recently, “just like four official investigations before it, found no credible or reliable evidence that Doctor King was killed by conspirators who framed James Earl Ray. Twenty years later, I remain absolutely convinced this well-supported finding is correct.”\n\nThe legacy of King’s assassination\n\nFor many, King’s assassination effectively marked the end of the civil-rights era in the United States. The white backlash he had foreseen would come to full flower in electoral politics. And his murder helped radicalize many disillusioned activists who felt their hopes for nonviolent change were over, and further fueled the rise of the Black Power movement that showed increasing disdain for King’s pacifist approach.\n\nMany of the documents from the FBI’s original investigation remain classified and won’t be released to the public until 2027.\n\nKing’s legacy and influence can still be felt today as a contentious political climate and renewed spirit of activism inspires millions of Americans to march peacefully in Washington to fight for everything from gender equality to science-based policy to gun-reform legislation.\n\nBernice King recently told 60 Minutes that despite the violence and controversy surrounding her father’s death, she doesn’t view it as a tragedy: “Our world is in a better place because our father gave his life.”\n\nRead next: The contentious history of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in photos\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Have you ever unexpectedly found yourself with a snatch of time in which to steal a nap? You tried to settle into the chair or nook in which you found yourself, closed your eyes, and then . . . you just sat there, drowsy but awake. Despite feeling quite tired, you couldn’t fall asleep, and soon the time was up before you had gotten in so much as a wink. Talk about frustrating! Not only did you not get to nap, you didn’t do anything else either; if you weren’t going to fall asleep, you could have done something productive instead!\n\nIt’s quite a knack to be able to fall asleep at the drop of a hat, regardless of where you are and what’s going on around you. To steal some shuteye at airports and on flights, on break times and car rides, in public places and private spaces — in all the interstices of life. Not to mention how grand it is to be able to go out like a light as soon as your head hits the pillow each night.\n\nIt probably seems, however, that this is simply a knack that some folks have and others don’t, with the latter group being much larger than the former.\n\nYet the ability to fall asleep in two minutes or less, anywhere, anytime, is actually a skill like any other, and one anyone can learn. The technique for how to do so was in fact developed for Naval aviators during World War II, and today we’ll share it with you.\n\nHow to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes or Less\n\nA couple years into WWII, the U.S. military realized it had a problem on its hands. Due to the enormous pressures of aerial combat, many of its pilots were accumulating levels of stress so debilitating that they were cracking under it. The tension caused them to lock up in flight and make fatal mistakes — accidentally shooting down friendly planes, or becoming an avoidable casualty themselves.\n\nIn an effort to stem the loss of pilots and planes, the military brought in Naval Ensign Bud Winter to research, develop, and test a scientific method for teaching relaxation. Before the war, Winter had been a successful college football and track coach, who had also worked with a professor of psychology on techniques to help athletes relax and perform better under the stress of competition. Stationed at the Del Monte Naval Pre-Flight School in California, his mission now was to coordinate with other coaches and professors to create a course that would similarly instruct cadets on how to stay calm and loose under the pressures of combat.\n\nThe end goal of the program was to teach the Naval aviators how to relax, so that they could learn more quickly, speed up their reaction time, sharpen their focus, and diminish their fear. The course also aimed to teach “combat aviators to be able to go to sleep in two minutes any time, day or night, under any and all conditions”; instruction in this skill was included to ensure that pilots got adequate sleep, and could sneak in extra shuteye whenever possible.\n\nTo accomplish the first goal, Winter taught the men how to physically relax. To accomplish the second, he taught them how to mentally relax. In fact, he essentially defined sleep as the state of being both physically and mentally relaxed.\n\nTo fall asleep at the drop of a hat, first you work on the former, and then the latter.\n\nHow to Physically Relax\n\nIn Relax and Win, the book Winter wrote about the program he developed for combat aviators and then used with athletes after the war, he lays out the exact instructions he gave to cadets to teach them how to relax their bodies; here we give them slightly condensed:\n\n“Sit back in your chairs and put your feet flat on the deck. Knees apart, your hands limp on the inside of your lap. Now, close your eyes and drop your chin until it rests on your chest.\n\nLet’s breathe slowly, deeply, and regularly. Take all the wrinkles out of your forehead. Relax your scalp. Just let go. Now let your jaw sag-g-g. Let it drop open. Now relax the rest of your face muscles. Get the brook trout look on your face. Even relax your tongue and lips. Just let them go loose. Breathe slowly.\n\nNow, let’s go after the eight muscles that control your eyes. Let them go limp in their sockets. No focus, just let them go limp. Breathe slowly.\n\nNow drop your shoulders as low as they will go. You think that they are low, but let them go more.  Did you feel the muscles in the back of your neck go limp? When you think you are really relaxed, let them go even more.\n\nNow, let’s relax your chest. Take a deep breath. Hold it. Exhale and blow out all your tensions. Just let your chest collapse. Let it sag-g-g. Imagine you are a big, heavy blob on the chair, a jellyfish. Breathe slowly. When you exhale, release more and more of your tensions.\n\nLet’s go after your arms. Talk directly to your arm muscles. First, talk to your right bicep. Tell it to relax, go limp. Do the same to your right forearm. Now to the right hand and fingers. Your arm should feel like a dead weight on your leg. Repeat the relaxation process with your left arm. Breathe slowly.\n\nYour entire upper body has been exposed to relaxation and a warm, pleasant feeling comes over you. You feel good. A sense of well-being invades your body.\n\nNow for your lower body. Talk to your right thigh muscles. Let them go to a dead weight on the chair. Let the meat hang on the bones. Go through the same routine for the right calf muscles. Then all the muscles of your right ankle and foot. Tell yourself that your right leg has no bones in it. It is just a flabby, heavy weight on the deck. Repeat the process with your left thigh, calf, ankle, and foot.\n\nAt present you are all relaxed physically, or think you are. For a little insurance, let’s take three deep breaths and when you let them out, blow out all the remaining tensions, one . . . whoosh, two . . . whoosh, three . . . whoosh.”\n\nIf you have trouble getting any of your body parts to feel sufficiently relaxed and jellyfish-like, try tensing them up first, and then letting them go loose.\n\nBy following the above protocol, you can achieve a nice general level of relaxation. Winter taught the cadets to cultivate this state in any pressure-filled situation, as it would loosen them up, dial down their nerves, enhance their concentration, and allow them to make better decisions.\n\nFrom this physically calm condition, Winter then taught the cadets how to “slip over the threshold into a deep, relaxed sleep” by becoming completely mentally relaxed.\n\nHow to Mentally Relax\n\nWinter argues that once you’re physically relaxed, if you get “your mind clear of any active thoughts for just ten seconds, you will be asleep.” The key to falling asleep quick is thus to stop the train of thoughts that is usually rumbling through your head. You have to stop ruminating on the regrets, worries, and problems of the day.\n\nWinter particularly warns against having any thoughts in which you are in motion; studies done by placing electrodes on the cadets’ bodies showed that even when you simply think of performing an activity, the muscles involved in that activity actually contract. Modern studies have in fact confirmed this observation, showing that simply imagining yourself exercising activates the same parts of the brain that come online when you’re physically in motion, and actually strengthens the muscles you imagine yourself using. While there might be some benefit to using your mind to “sit and be fit,” thinking about being active while trying to go to sleep can create muscular tension and inhibit its onset.\n\nSo, when you’re looking to nod off, you just want to fill your head with the stillest, calmest of contemplations. Winter suggests three good ones to use, though you don’t have to use all three; just pick one, and if it doesn’t work, try another:\n\n“First, we want you to fantasize that it is a warm spring day and you are lying in the bottom of a canoe on a very serene lake. You are looking up at a blue sky with lazy, floating clouds. Do not allow any other thought to creep in. Just concentrate on this picture and keep foreign thoughts out, particularly thoughts with any movement or motion involved. Hold this picture and enjoy it for ten seconds.\n\nIn the second sleep-producing fantasy, imagine that you are in a big, black, velvet hammock and everywhere you look is black. You must also hold this picture for ten seconds.\n\nThe third trick is to say the words ‘don’t think . . . don’t think . . . don’t think,’ etc. Hold this, blanking out other thoughts for at least ten seconds.”\n\nThe cadets at the pre-flight school had been broken into two groups: one which took the relaxation course, and the other a control group. The former outperformed the latter in every mentally-taxing class, discipline-requiring drill, and physically-intensive test. And after six weeks of practice, 96% of the aviators were able to fall asleep in 2 minutes or less — anywhere and anytime. Not only that, they could do it even when they drank coffee (though having caffeine in your system does make it harder), and even while the simulated noise of machine gunfire and cannon blasts played in the background!\n\nAfter the war, Winter taught the track athletes he coached the same relaxation techniques, and became one of the greatest sprint coaches of all time, producing 102 All-Americans and 27 Olympians; at one time, his runners held all 10 world records for sprinting events.\n\nWinter strongly believed that the wartime program for relaxation he helped develop to fight combat stress, and which athletes subsequently used to deal with the pressures of competition, was just as applicable to the tensions and fatigue civilians faced in their everyday lives.\n\nYou can use this general relaxation method to get physically relaxed whenever you’re feeling stressed out, and then tack on the mental relaxation exercise when you want to fall asleep fast. It’s handy for when you find yourself with a short window of time for a snooze; Winter thought even a 5-minute nap was incredibly refreshing. You could also use it to take a “hypnagogic nap” — a micro nap that artists like Salvador Dali used, in which you allow yourself to doze off for just a second in order to glean the creative insights that can arise on the threshold between sleep and wakefulness.\n\nOr, of course, you can simply use this technique when you go to bed, to more quickly and contentedly enter your nightly block of sleep.\n\nKeep in mind that being able to relax physically and mentally, and thus being able to fall asleep at the drop of a hat, is a skill, and like all skills, you shouldn’t expect to get the hang of it and have it work the first few times you try. You have to practice over and over again, until you get better and better at loosening up and calming down. That doesn’t mean you should work hard at trying to relax; that will just backfire and create tension. But you do have to practice this routine consistently.\n\nThe post How to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes or Less appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",

          "description": "As the story goes, 80-something years ago, Thornton Prince wasn’t exactly the best husband. To teach him a lesson—and show him just how good he had it—his wife made him fried chicken doused in hot pepper, so spicy it burned. One thing led to another and it became a household—and neighborhood and Nashville—favorite, and soon, a business was born. Now, the Prince family is famous not only for having created this iconic dish, but for running one of the city’s most respected establishments: Prince’s.\n\nBeyond its motherland, you can get hot chicken just about anywhere these days. In 2016, Nation’s Restaurant News explained the national boom by KFC’s hopping on the bandwagon, which helped spread the dish’s appeal addictiveness far and wide. Like Thornton, once you try it, you’ll keep coming back for more (and more).\n\nWe’re going to need more napkins for this one.\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nHere’s how it’s done. Bread bone-in chicken parts: Classically, they’re soaked in buttermilk, then tumbled around in flour—both probably spiced—to yield a sturdy, craggy crust. While other Southern fried chicken stops there, Nashville keeps going. While the chicken cooks, you combine a blend of spices—cayenne is key, plus brown sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Add a pour of hot fry oil—or lard or bacon grease (what, you don’t always have bacon grease on hand?)—and this becomes a makeshift chile oil. When the chicken is done, it goes for a dip, then makes you weep with joy (and capsaicin).\n\nWhen I went to Nashville with a bunch of friends, we went to Hattie B’s, the other hot hot chicken place in town. There, the chicken comes atop slices of squishy white bread, which soaks up the cayenne grease, plus a couple sweet, crunchy pickles for good measure. You can order the chicken in six heat levels: Southern (no heat); mild (touch of heat); medium (warming up); hot! (feel the heat); damn hot!! (fire starter); shut the cluck up!!! (burn notice). I ordered the second to last—when in Nashville, right?—and, in retrospect, I regret this.\n\n 🔥🍗\n \nA post shared by  Emma Laperruque (@emmalaperruque) on Apr 30, 2017 at 1:34pm PDT\n\nSince I probably won’t be going back to Music City any time soon, I wanted to re-create this experience at home (you know, without the cayenne-crying). I started with Hattie B’s recipe, available on the Food Network website. I slightly lowered the cayenne, amped up the accompanying spices, and turned the whole thing into a sandwich. The sesame bun, iceberg lettuce, bread-and-butter pickles—and all the mayo—help tame the burn. At least a little.\n\nNashville-Style Hot Chicken Sandwich\n\nBy Emma Laperruque\n\nView Full Recipe\n\nHave you ever tried (or made) hot chicken before? Tell us more in the comments!",

For those of us sick of this long winter, OpenTable has released their list of the 100 Best Restaurants in America for a Big Night Out, right in time for al fresco dining weather.\n\n“The list features an array of buzz-worthy restaurants, from up-and-coming to established, trendy to tried-and-true, across 24 states and Washington, DC,” said Caroline Potter, OpenTable’s chief dining officer. “Whatever your notion of a big night out entails, whether it’s a bustling bar scene or a spot to see-and-be-seen, fun is on the menu at any of these honorees.”\n\nWith 18 restaurants on the list, California boasts the highest number of restaurants for a night on the town, with Florida slightly behind with 17 locales. In total, 50 cities are on the list; New York and Las Vegas appear more than any other destination, with Chicago trailing closely behind with seven restaurants.\n\nThe list of the 100 Best Restaurants for a Big Night Out is generated from more than 12 million verified OpenTable diner reviews collected between February 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018. All restaurants with a minimum “overall” score and number of qualifying reviews were included for consideration; qualifying restaurants were then scored and sorted, according to the percentage of reviews for which “hot spot” was selected as a special feature. Based on this methodology, the restaurants below, listed in alphabetical order, make up OpenTable’s Hot 100 for 2018.\n\nThe 100 best restaurants (domestically) for a big night out, according to OpenTable diners:\n\nAl Biernat’s – Oak Lawn – Dallas, Texas\nAndina – Portland, Oregon\nBattalion – San Antonio, Texas\nBeauty & Essex – Multiple Locations\nBestia – Los Angeles, California\nBlend on the Water – Long Island City, New York\nThe Boathouse – Lake Buena Vista, Florida\nBrewery Bhavana – Raleigh, North Carolina\nBuddakan – Multiple Locations\nCampfire – Carlsbad, California\nCampiello – Naples, Florida\nCarmine’s – 44th Street – New York, New York\nCarnivale – Chicago, Illinois\nCarson’s Food & Drink – Lexington, Kentucky\nCatch – Multiple Locations\nCharlie’s of Bay Head – Bay Head, New Jersey\nCoasterra – San Diego, California\nCompère Lapin – New Orleans, Louisiana\nCooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant – Multiple Locations\nDel Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nDeparture Restaurant and Lounge – Portland, Oregon\nDouble Knot – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nDuck Duck Goat – Chicago, Illinois\nEl Five – Denver, Colorado\nEl Vez – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nFlight Restaurant & Wine Bar – Memphis, Tennessee\nGato – New York, New York\nGiada – The Cromwell – Las Vegas, Nevada\nGibsons Bar & Steakhouse – Chicago, Illinois\nGirl & the Goat – Chicago, Illinois\nGordon Ramsay Steak – Paris Las Vegas – Las Vegas, Nevada\nGracias Madre – West Hollywood, California\nGW Fins – New Orleans, Louisiana\nHalls Chophouse – Charleston, South Carolina\nHarp & Crown – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nHell’s Kitchen Minneapolis – Minneapolis, Minnesota\nHerb & Wood – San Diego, California\nHusk – Charleston – Charleston, South Carolina\nIronside Fish & Oyster – San Diego, California\nIvan Ramen – New York, New York\nIvy – West Hollywood, California\nJuniper & Ivy – San Diego, California\nJuvia – Miami, Florida\nKaluz Restaurant – Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nKomodo – Miami, Florida\nKYU – Miami, Florida\nThe Lark – Santa Barbara, California\nLe Diplomate – Washington, DC\nLinger – Denver, Colorado\nLouie Bossi’s Ristorante Bar Pizzeria – Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nLUCA – Lancaster, Pennsylvania\nMaple & Ash – Chicago, Illinois\nMariposa – Sedona, Arizona\nMastro’s Ocean Club – Newport Beach, California\nMeril – New Orleans, Louisiana\nMoku Kitchen – Honolulu, Hawaii\nMomofuku Las Vegas – Las Vegas, Nevada\nMora Italian – Phoenix, Arizona\nMorimoto Asia – Lake Buena Vista, Florida\nMyers + Chang – Boston, Massachusetts\nNobu – Caesars Palace Las Vegas – Las Vegas, Nevada\nNorth Italia – BLVD – Houston, Texas\nOcean Prime – Naples, Florida\nOld Ebbitt Grill – Washington, DC\nThe Optimist – Atlanta, Georgia\nOtium – Los Angeles, California\nOxford Exchange – Tampa, Florida\nParc – Detroit, Michigan\nThe Pearl – Columbus, Ohio\nPerch LA – Los Angeles, California\nPump – West Hollywood, California\nRed Ash Italia – Austin, Texas\nRed Rooster Harlem – New York, New York\nRepublique – Los Angeles, California\nRPM Italian & Steak – Multiple Locations\nSacred Pepper – Tampa, Florida\nSampan – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nSixty Vines – Plano, Texas\nSotto – Cincinnati, Ohio\nSouthern Social – Germantown, Tennessee\nSt. Elmo Steak House – Indianapolis, Indiana\nSteak 44 – Phoenix, Arizona\nSteak 48 – Houston, Texas\nSteve & Cookie’s By the Bay – Margate, New Jersey\nSTK- Multiple locations\nSumoMaya Mexican – Asian Kitchen – Scottsdale, Arizona\nTao – Multiple locations\nThe Tropicale – Palm Springs, California\nTown – San Carlos, California\nTWO urban licks – Atlanta, Georgia\nUchi – Austin, Texas\nUlele – Tampa, Florida\nUncle Julio’s – Brentwood – Brentwood, Tennessee\nUrban Grub – Nashville, Tennessee\nVandal – New York, New York\nWater Grill – South Coast Plaza – Costa Mesa, California\nWoodberry Kitchen – Baltimore, Maryland\nYardbird Southern Table & Bar – Miami Beach, Florida\nYvonne’s – Boston, Massachusetts\nZahav – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n Featured Image by knape via Getty Images\n",

          "description": "It’s why people are putting grass-fed butter in their coffee, fasting for days, and replacing their cereal and pasta with eggs and avocados. \n\nThe ketogenic diet has become a Silicon Valley obsession and the diet du jour that supposedly keeps celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Halle Barry trim and strong.\n\nKeto devotees believe that if you banish most carbs (including fruit!) and embrace fat, you can lose weight without feeling hungry. \n\n#FitnessFriday! I think the most important part of being healthy and in great shape depends on what and when you eat. Being diabetic most of my life, I have always had to take food very seriously. Today I encourage you to say yes to the keto diet, give it a try... pic.twitter.com/9Fa1NeVVPo\n— Halle Berry (@halleberry) January 26, 2018\n\nThe diet’s long history in science also lends it credibility. Doctors have been prescribing ketogenic diets to treat epilepsy for nearly a century, and increasingly believe it may hold promise for people with Type 2 diabetes. \n\nBut what’s lost in the many trend articles and books about “going keto” for weight loss today is that this diet is the same one the now-late Dr. Robert Atkins and other low-carb evangelists have been selling since the 1960’s. (Diet peddlers have an incredible knack for rebranding old ideas — over and over — and in our eternal confusion about what to eat, we keep falling for it all.) \n\nThose older keto diets didn’t work for most people hoping to slim down, and there’s no evidence the newly popular keto diet will be any different. Here’s why. \n\nHow the ketogenic diet works  \n\nTo understand the ketogenic diet, you need a quick primer on how the the human body gets energy. We are fueled primarily by glucose, or blood sugar, much of which we derive from carbohydrates in foods like bread, fruit, potatoes, and sweets. \n\nIf glucose levels in the blood drop to really low levels, we’d pass out and die. But, interestingly, the body can’t store much glucose — only enough to last a couple of days. So if we forgo eating carbs for a few days, we need other ways to keep going. One of those is a process called ketogenesis. \n\nIn ketogenesis, our livers start to break down fat into a usable energy source called ketone bodies, or ketones for short. “Organs like the brain that normally rely primarily on glucose for fuel can begin to use a substantial amount of ketones,” said Kevin Hall, a National Institutes of Health senior investigator who has studied the ketogenic diet extensively. So ketones can stand in for glucose as fuel for the body when there’s a glucose shortage. “It’s an amazing physiological adaption to starvation that allows tissues like the brain to survive,” Hall added.  \n\nOnce ketogenesis kicks in and ketone levels are elevated, the body is in a state called “ketosis.” There are a few ways to get into ketosis. One is through fasting: When you stop eating altogether for an extended period of time, the body will ramp up fat burning for fuel and decrease its use of glucose (which is part of the reason people can survive for as long as 73 days without food).  \n\n        Going keto means subsisting mainly on meats, eggs, cheese, fish, nuts, butter, oils, and vegetables — and avoiding sugar, bread and other grains, beans, and even fruit.\n\n        Elena Shashkina/Shutterstock\n\nAnother way to get into ketosis is by eating less than 20 to 50 grams of carbs — or a slice or two of bread — per day. So people on ketogenic diets get 5 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, about 15 percent from protein, and 80 percent from fat. Note that that’s a much lower ratio of protein and more fat than you’d get on other low-carb diets, but it’s this ratio that will force the body to derive much of its energy from ketones.\n\nIn practice, that means subsisting mainly on meats, eggs, cheese, fish, nuts, butter, oils, and vegetables — and carefully avoiding sugar, bread and other grains, beans, and even fruit. Again, if this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s not that different from the Atkins diet, among the most famous very low-carb diets that promise to get your body burning fat. (Atkins promised to help people “stay thin forever,” the same way the now popular Keto Reset Diet book promises to “burn fat forever.”)\n\nWhile the evidence behind ketogenic diets for diabetes is still preliminary and the evidence for weight loss isn’t all that convincing (more on that next), the evidence of using the diet to treat epilepsy is extremely robust. The idea of treating people with epilepsy with the keto diet came about in the 1920s, when researchers observed that people who fasted experienced fewer seizures. (Researchers still aren’t sure why the diet can work for epilepsy, but a few mechanisms have been proposed, including making neurons more resilient during seizures.) \n\nToday, studies have shown that children and adults whose epilepsy doesn’t respond to medications seem to experience a pretty large reduction in seizures when following a ketogenic diet. That doesn’t, however, mean that the diet works for other conditions. \n\nThe theory behind very low-carb diets is that they help people burn extra calories and fat — and lose more weight  \n\nAdvocates of ketogenic diets for weight loss claim that ketogenesis can lead to a “metabolic advantage” that helps burn 10 times more fat and an extra 400 to 600 calories per day — the same as a vigorous session of physical activity. The main scientific model that’s used to explain that advantage is the ”carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis,” which has been promoted by experts like Harvard professor David Ludwig, Obesity Code author Jason Fung, and Robert Lustig of the University of California San Francisco, among others.\n\nEating carbs drives up insulin production, the hypothesis suggests, stirring hunger and causing the body to hold on to fat and suppress calorie burn. But when you replace carbs with fat, you subdue hunger, boost calorie burn, and melt away fat. With fewer carbs, your body also doesn’t produce as much insulin — and that increases the rate of ketogenesis and decreases the body’s need for glucose. \n\nThis might sound great, but what’s often lost in all the boosterism is that this is still just a hypothesis. And most studies of ketogenic and other very low-carb diets suggest they don’t actually outperform other kinds of diets in the long run when it comes to weight loss. \n\nKeto diets don’t seem to help people lose extra weight in the long run\n\nThe keto concept has been catnip for many dieters, perhaps because of the failure of the low-fat experiment of the 1980s and ’90s to help people lose weight, and the fact that food companies increasingly tell us to be suspicious of carbs and eat more protein. \n\nWhen you look at head-to-head studies comparing low-carb diets to other kinds of diets, weight loss on a very low-carb diet can be a little more dramatic in the short term, but by the one-year mark, all diets perform equally miserably. \n\nThis seminal randomized trial, published in JAMA in 2007, involved 300 women and measured their weight loss on the Atkins diet compared to the Zone, Learn, and Ornish diets. The researchers found that while women on Atkins shed a few more pounds, the weight loss was “likely to be at least as large as for any other dietary pattern.” In other words, Atkins wasn’t substantially better than the other diets. \n\n        JAMA\n\nOther big studies comparing popular diets of different macronutrient compositions, like the one I mentioned above, consistently suggest that the very low-carb approach isn’t a sustainable solution for weight loss. A review of the research on weight loss for different types of diets, published in the Lancet in 2015, found that people on low-carb diets lost 1 kilogram of additional weight after one year compared to people on low-fat diets — again, a marginal difference. \n\nStill, in the short term, low-carb diets like keto can sometimes help people lose more weight because they cause rapid water loss, which gives people the impression they’ve lost fat. “This happens because low-carbohydrate diets deplete stored glycogen, and glycogen binds large amounts of water,” explained obesity researcher Stephan Guyenet. \n\nAnother reason very low-carb diets seem to help with weight loss initially is that there’s some evidence they’re effective for appetite control, “so most people actually eat fewer calories than they would on most other diets,” said Guyenet, adding: “The evidence supporting this isn’t great right now, but that seems to be where it’s going.” \n\nBut again, these benefits seem to disappear in the long run, probably because very low-carb diets — like many other fad diets — are hard to stick to. In our food environment, it’s extremely difficult to avoid eating foods like bread, cookies, or pasta for months on end. As Guyenet wrote on his blog: \n\nThe more extreme a diet, the harder it is to adhere to, and the ketogenic diet is extreme. “But wait”, you say, “I’ve been on the ketogenic diet for five years and it’s easy!” That may be true, but randomized controlled trials don’t lie. The average person can’t even stick with the diet for six months, as judged by urinary ketone levels. The minority of people who find it easy, get good results, and stick with it are the ones who write about it on the Internet.\n\nEven people who adhere to a very low-carb diet in the short term don’t necessarily reap the benefits proponents claim they will — like the increased calorie burn and fat loss. That’s what the NIH’s Kevin Hall found in another study he designed that’s considered the most rigorous scientific test of ketogenic diets for weight loss. \n\nFor the study, he confined 17 overweight and obese patients for two months to a hospital, where researchers measured their every movement and controlled what they were eating. (Diet researchers called this study the “gold standard” since it was an extremely well-controlled experiment, with all food provided, and it used the best technologies for measuring energy expenditure and body composition.)\n\nIn the first month of the study, participants were put on a baseline diet, which was designed to be similar to what they reported they were eating outside the hospital, including lots of sugary carbohydrates. For the second month, the participants got the same amount of calories and protein as they did in the first month of the study, but ramped up the amount of fat in their food and ate far fewer carbs.\n\n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\nThe benefits for the participants following the very low-carb diets weren’t nearly as dramatic as ketogenic proponents claim. While the participants saw their insulin levels drop and stay low, they only saw a small increase in calorie burn, and that waned over time. (That short-lived increase in calorie burn amounted to about 100 extra calories per day — much less than the 400 to 600 calories promised by low-carb gurus.) \n\nCompared to the baseline diet, the low-carb diet did not cause subjects to experience an increase in fat loss. To be more specific, it took the full 28 days on the low-carb diet for the subjects to lose the same amount of fat as they did in the last 15 days on the baseline (higher-carb) diet that wasn’t even designed to get them to lose weight. So the researchers did not find evidence of big benefits regarding energy expenditure or fat loss after switching to a low-carb diet.\n\n”According to the insulin-carbohydrate model, we should have seen an acceleration in the rate of body fat loss when insulin secretion was cut by 50 percent,” Hall told me when the study came out. But he didn’t, which he thinks suggests that the regulation of fat tissue storage in the body has to do with more than just insulin levels and their relationship with the carbs we eat.\n\nThe results of the study were also echoed by a previous paper on the insulin-carbohydrate model, where Hall found that when people cut fat in their diets, they had slightly greater body fat loss than when they cut the same number of calories from carbs. \n\nWhen I recently asked Hall what this research tells us about weight loss with the ketogenic diet, he said simply: “The idea is that low-carb, ketogenic diets cause your body to burn way more calories, resulting in a lot of weight loss, even if you eat more than you were eating before. But our studies, as well as many others, demonstrate nothing of the sort.” \n\nFor diabetes specifically, keto may be helpful — but the “reversal” claim is overblown\n\nNow that we’ve gotten the weight loss claims out of the way, let’s look at a more promising area of research: using the ketogenic diet as a way to treat or manage Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWith Type 2 diabetes, the body lacks sufficient insulin to move glucose from the blood into the cells for energy. Eating carbs results in an increase in blood glucose — so if you vastly cut down your carbs, your blood glucose levels won’t go up as much, and you won’t need as much insulin to manage blood sugars. It’s not surprising that researchers have been finding that people who follow a ketogenic diet can better manage their blood sugar by cutting down their carbs. \n\nIn one of the most recent studies on the question, which appeared this month in the journal Diabetes Therapy, 262 adults with Type 2 diabetes patients followed a ketogenic diet, coupled with intensive lifestyle counseling. After a year, their hemoglobin A1C (a measure of blood sugar) dropped below 6.5 percent, the threshold for Type 2 diabetes. Their use of diabetes medications also declined, from 57 percent to 30 percent, and the need for insulin was either reduced or eliminated in 94 percent of the participants who were using insulin when the study began.\n\nThese are impressive results. And other randomized controlled trials on the effects of low-carb diets for Type 2 diabetes have also found improved glycemic control and reduced medication use among patients. \n\nBut the new study was sponsored and run by employees of Virta Health, a company selling lifestyle counseling on ketogenic diets for Type 2 diabetics. Virta, as well as other proponents of keto for diabetes, claims the diet can “reverse” diabetes — and that’s going to a step too far. \n\n“What’s been demonstrated is that [the ketogenic diet] controls blood glucose levels,” explained Guyenet. “That’s a good thing. But to show true remission or reversal, you have to show a person can go back to being able to eat carbs without having diabetes again.” And that has never been proven with the ketogenic diet.  \n\nIndeed, many studies have shown the opposite effect — that the body’s ability to tolerate carbohydrates can decrease after following a low-carb, high-fat diet.   \n\nAnother common effect of the ketogenic diet is “keto flu”: fatigue, lightheadedness, and dizziness people feel when they greatly reduce their carb intake. This effect should go away after the body adjusts to the diet, but staying on keto for a long time may lead to kidney stones, high cholesterol, constipation, slowed growth (in young people), and bone fractures. \n\nStill, if you have diabetes, it might be worth talking about the ketogenic diet with your doctor. But if you’re going keto to lose weight, buyer beware: In the long run, it looks a lot like other fad diets. \n",

(Or any not fish dinner, for that matter—but we'll get to that.)\n\nIt’s not as if making a stock for seafood soups and stews takes all that long to begin with. Unlike meatier bone-based broths, stock made from shrimp shells or fish bones typically doesn’t simmer for more than 20 or 30 minutes, which puts it squarely into the “eh, might as well” category, if you ever find yourself with a stash of them.\n\nBut with this smart technique, you can hack a super-flavorful broth pretty much out of nowhere—no shell and bone pile required. Bouillabaisse, take a number!\n\nThe trick is nestled in Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for quick-braised fish with baby potatoes and greens (she used asparagus; in the pit of New York winter, we used some perky greenhouse-grown spinach). “I wanted to make a one-pot meal with fresh Alaskan halibut that did not require the extra time and ingredients for a fish stock,” as she wrote in the New York Times in 2015. “But I did want broth that tasted of the sea, so I did what many cooks in Southern France and Italy do, and pounded anchovies in a mortar and pestle with garlic.”\n\nWhen you take flavorful ingredients like anchovies, garlic, and nuts and crush them together into a paste, they don’t just become a sauce you can smear or soften in oil, but one you can unleash to bloom in water to flavor just about anything, instantly. Or, as Shulman says, “And voilà: a quick Mediterranean broth.”\n\nHere, it’s a delicate fish like halibut (or whatever is swimming nearer to you)—but you can use this technique with all sorts of other things that would benefit from a flavor boost: greens, pasta, couscous, beans. Not only is the trick speedy, it’s endlessly customizable. Pound in shallots or fennel seed or chiles at will, as you might when DIYing herby salsas and pestos.\n\nThe flavors latch on quickly, following a classic sear-and-simmer braise, just sped up for seafood-friendly cook time. And you—with your lovely, not-the-least-bit-boring fish dinner on the table—get to tuck away your magic wand to use another day.\n\nMartha Rose Shulman’s Quick-Braised Fish With Baby Potatoes & Greens\n\nBy Genius Recipes\n\n1/2 teaspoon saffron threads\n\n2 tablespoons lightly toasted almonds\n\n2 garlic cloves, green shoots removed, or 4 green garlic cloves\n\n2 anchovies, rinsed\n\nSalt and black pepper to taste\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nFour 5- to 6-ounce halibut fillets (or substitute another firm, mild fish)\n\n1 pound baby potatoes, cut in 3/4-inch pieces, or small potatoes, halved and sliced about 3/4-inch thick\n\n3/4 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut in 2-inch lengths (or when asparagus isn’t in season, substitute another green like spinach or peas)\n\n2 tablespoons minced parsley\n\n2 tablespoons minced basil\n\nView Full Recipe\n\nPhotos by Julia Gartland\n\nGot a genius recipe to share—from a classic cookbook, an online source, or anywhere, really?

WyzeCam v2 is supposed to ship at the end of the month, and the company claims it will continue to support the original model through app and firmware updates.\n",

          "description": "Amazon’s size and reach—not to mention its willingness to sacrifice profits for market share—make it a company that every other business is scared to go up against. Among them are America’s fashion retailers, who have had to face off with Amazon ever since it started an aggressive push into selling clothes.\n\nCoresight Research, an independent firm focused on retail and technology (formerly Fung Global Retail & Technology), surveyed 1,699 demographically representative, internet-using Americans about what clothing they’re buying on Amazon, as well as the stores they’ve shifted away from. Nobody can yet say with certainty how much business Amazon is siphoning from other fashion retailers, and other than Amazon, nobody knows exactly what customers are buying on the site. But the results offer a hint about which companies should be most concerned about Amazon’s fashion ambitions, and in what areas they’re losing out.\n\nAmazon’s clothing business is getting bigger\n\nVarious sources estimate that Amazon is now the biggest clothing retailer in the country based on merchandise volume, thanks in large part to its massive third-party marketplace. In Coresight’s survey, of the 1,564 respondents who said they bought clothes or footwear in the last year, more had actually done their shopping at Walmart than at any other retailer. But Amazon came in second, just edging out Target and Kohl’s.\n\nThe companies losing clothing dollars to Amazon\n\nThat rapid growth comes at the expense of competitors. Coresight identified 446 people who said they spend more of their clothing and footwear budget at Amazon than they did about three years ago, and asked them which retailers they switched their spending away from. The top answers were Target and Walmart, two of America’s big-box giants.\n\nDepartment stores including Kohl’s, Macy’s, and JCPenney weren’t far behind. Further down the list were inexpensive and off-price retailers, from Old Navy and Gap to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack.\n\nThe clothing categories Amazon shoppers are buying\n\nCoresight also asked the 719 people in the survey who said they had bought clothing or shoes from Amazon in the last year about what items they were buying. Contrary to the idea that people are just stocking up on socks and underwear, footwear was by far the top category. Women’s and men’s casual clothing took the next spots on the list. It’s still a safe bet that people tend to buy basics on Amazon more than trendy fashion, as other research has found. But the results show that Amazon is finding shoppers who aren’t just loading up on white tube socks.\n\nThe clothing and footwear brands people buy on Amazon\n\nCoresight asked people who had bought clothes or footwear on Amazon in the last year what brands they’d purchased. The results show that another Amazon strategy—private fashion labels—is working well. When combined, its own private labels, including Amazon Essentials, Lark+Ro, Goodthreads, Rebel Canyon, and more, came in ahead of well-known labels like Adidas and Calvin Klein. (The private labels wouldn’t have fared as well individually, of course.) Only Nike, Under Armour, and Hanes beat out Amazon’s private labels.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nOne other notable finding was that survey respondents who were Amazon Prime members were much more likely to have purchased clothing or footwear from Amazon than non-Prime members. In fact, among Prime members, Amazon was the clothing retailer most had shopped at, while among non-Prime members, Amazon was just the seventh most-popular retailer.\n\nFor Amazon, that’s an advantage, as opposed to a problem. Prime membership keeps growing rapidly; by one estimate, more than half of US households now have a Prime account. As Prime continues its spread, the indication is that more of those households will start buying their clothes on Amazon, likely to the detriment of stores such as Target and Walmart. Some companies, such as Nike and Hanes, might benefit. But the one that stands to gain most of all, of course, is Amazon itself.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "My first-day advice to new members of the team boils down to, “Don’t worry, you are going to be totally miserable in about three months.”\n\nWe all know the excitement of that first day at work. There are new people to meet, new projects to learn, and new roles and responsibilities to master. Part of the intoxication of those early weeks is they are often the only time in our adult lives we are allowed to ask stupid questions and not have to pretend to know everything.\n\nAnd despite that opportunity, our learning plan is often simply, “Give me a few weeks to get up to speed and I will own the place.” That approach boosts our short-term confidence but also sets unrealistic expectations for our ability to quickly understand and master the complexity of the organization and its needs.\n\nIn user experience design (UX) research, we think a lot about mental models — how a user believes a process works vs. the system model of how it was actually designed; and framing — the context in which an interaction is interpreted. In essence, your satisfaction within an experience can depend a lot on your initial expectations.\n\nFor new employees, the expectation we need to set is that while the initial learning curve is steep, the on-boarding process actually never ends nor does it move in a predictably straight line.\n\nI describe it like this:\n\nThe first month is like sitting in a waiting-room. There are lots of doors with people passing through, plenty to read, and free coffee if you can figure out how to operate the machine.\n\nAnd while reading and caffeinating is great, you will soon be excited to pick a door, enter a side room, and get down to work. This is a most glorious time. You will start to feel productive, in control, valued and effective.\n\nThen one afternoon, maybe three months later, you will inevitably walk up to another door. Behind it lie some unpleasant new realities. Maybe your first big project missed a deadline and you feel responsible. Or your boss has grown distant since those early days of interviewing, training and goal setting. Or your commute is worse than you thought. Whatever the cause, the honeymoon is over and some early doubts creep in.\n\nDeciding how to open this door is key. Because everyone experiences it. And after months of gaining competence and confidence, you are going to feel a bit miserable realizing you don’t know nearly as much as you thought. How could you have been so mistaken? So self-deluded? So in the wrong career? It can feel like an actual crisis in the moment.\n\nFortunately, at this point most of us actively re-invest in the job. With effort, the organization reveals new puzzle pieces (system model) and we improve our understanding (mental model) of how to navigate the challenges. We open the door, discover new skills and grow more confident and productive than we had before.\n\nBut here is the trick: This cycle repeats itself endlessly. Maybe first at three months, then 18 months, then four years. Each time the door seems heavier and the crisis more dire. Each time you will feel miserable and each time you will wonder if you should go update your LinkedIn profile.\n\nWe can’t avoid the doors and we can’t avoid some amount of psychic pain and misery each time. But learning to recognize the pattern is transformative. It can turn a month’s worth of anxious lunch hours lost to checking monster.com into a few days of introspection followed by a fulfilling action plan.\n\nThe challenge is, people often think their crisis of confidence in these situations is a personal failing. That their impostor syndrome is showing. That they have picked the wrong job or career. This is almost never true. So how do we avoid people falling for that conceit?\n\nTell them well in advance you know they will find some doors too heavy to open alone. “Don’t worry, you are going to be totally miserable in about three months. But it won’t last — if you see it coming.”\n\nTell them how you think it might happen and when. Set the expectation so they can recognize the pattern. And then give them a hand when they do. In this case, knowing is half the battle.\n\nThis article was originally published on KIESOW 8.0.\n",

          "description": "“I stand here before you unapologetically Muslim-American. Unapologetically Palestinian. Unapologetically from Brooklyn, New York. Sisters and brothers, you are what democracy looks like,” Linda Sarsour told half-million protesters on Jan. 21, 2017, at the Women’s March on Washington.\n\nAs one of the three co-leaders of what was likely the largest single-day demonstration in US history, Sarsour made a promise to the massive crowd: “You can count on me, your Palestinian-Muslim sister, to keep her voice loud, keep her feet on the streets, keep my head held high, because I am not afraid.” Fear, she stated, is a choice. And having become an outspoken civil-rights activist after 9/11, Sarsour epitomizes what it means to choose empowerment over fear.\n\nIn an era when Muslim women are being systematically discriminated against, Sarsour refuses to tone down her anger or her universal call for love. She wears a hijab proudly, and in the words of Barack Obama’s White House, “shatters stereotypes of Muslim women.” In profound yet accessible language, she articulates why liberation and safety for Muslim Americans is not complementary to, but rather essential to, liberation and safety for all Americans.\n\nNow national co-chair of the Women’s March and executive director of MPower Change, a grassroots movement rooted in diverse Muslim communities across the US, Sarsour has been at the forefront of major local and national social-justice campaigns over the past two decades. She was formerly the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, co-founder of Muslims for Ferguson, and a member of the NY Justice League. In 2011, she was honored by then-president Obama as a “Champion of Change.” Writing in Time, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand credited Sarsour and her Women’s March co-chairs as “the suffragists of our time,” driving the “rebirth of the women’s movement.”\n\nIn an interview with Quartz, Sarsour explains why liberation depends on intersectionality, the native Brooklyn grit that fuels her success, and the freedom of giving without expecting gratitude in return.\n\n1. What’s your big idea that other people aren’t thinking about or wouldn’t agree with? Why is it so important?\n\nWe cannot win if we do not organize across communities, issues, and movements. Intersectionality is a term introduced to us by Dr. Kimberley Crenshaw, and now the implementation of her vision is the key to winning elections in 2018 and long-term, systemic changes. We have to begin seeing ourselves as whole human beings who are impacted by a multitude of issues, so our approach must be holistic and inclusive. Alleviating suffering of the most marginalized communities must begin with assessing the needs of entire communities and allowing the most marginalized to lead the strategy. My belief is those closest to the pain are closest to the solution.\n\n2. What behavior or personality trait do you most attribute to your success?\n\nI have a very resilient Brooklyn personality that allows me to stay thick-skinned and focused on my mission and goals. As an activist, organizer, Palestinian, and a Muslim-American woman, I have faced many obstacles in the industry I work in. I often have to fight for my seat and representation for the communities I represent. I also face intense criticism, vicious hate, and threats—so my Brooklyn grit, take-no-crap attitude has helped me succeed, has grounded me in why I do the work I do, and kept me focused on winning campaigns centered around justice for communities in New York City and nationally.\n\n3. If you could make one change to help women at work, what would it be?\n\nWomen need to find the courage to demand what they rightfully deserve. Women should be paid for the same work as their male counterparts, ask for promotions, and stand in their power in their place of employment, whether they are in a boardroom or in the movement. Women need to reprogram the work culture we have been fed that says women shouldn’t be so aggressive and “bossy.” Taking initiative and leadership is what women have always been good at when given the opportunity and space.\n\n4. At the start of your career, what do you wish you had known? What, if anything, do you wish you had not believed?\n\nAt the start of my career as a full-time activist and organizer, I wish I would have known how time consuming and physically and emotionally draining the work to fight for civil and human rights for all people is, but especially for Muslim Americans in a post-9/11 America. I wish I would have known that I too would experience trauma, and to have better prepared myself. I believed in people and their will to stand up against powerful forces and for the most marginalized, but as I got deeper into the work, apathy was everywhere and very discouraging.\n\n[series-recirc]\n\n5. When in your career did you feel most despondent, and what did you do to turn it around?\n\nI find myself feeling despondent often under this new administration. I work with families who are separated due to the Muslim ban or undocumented youth who fear deportation or friends and family who need their healthcare to survive. I find hope in spending time with those most marginalized by organizing and resisting against this administration, and reminding them that they still have power and we have their back. The continued protests from the Women’s March, the airport protests to welcome refugees, and working against the tax-reform bill gave me the fortitude to keep moving forward.\n\n6. A key part of success is building strong professional relationships. What practice do you use to cultivate them with your colleagues?\n\nAs an organizer, I see the power of the one-on-one: This is an organizing tool where you meet people individually to understand their goals, their values, and the things they care about. My most prized possessions are open, honest relationships based on respect and dignity where my colleagues feel that I am there for them professionally and personally. I enjoy coffee meetings, drinks (non-alcoholic for me), and dinners with my co-workers. This helps with team building, trust, and more productive work environments.\n\n7. What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?\n\nThe best advice I ever received was from one of my mentors, Dr. Ahmad Jaber, who told me to never expect or wait for anyone to thank me for doing good by others. This work for justice is more to take care of my heart and my soul, and eventually I will be rewarded when I least expect it.\n\n8. If there’s one thing men can do to improve women’s life at work, it would be…\n\nIf there’s one thing men can do to improve women’s life at work, it would be to treat women with the utmost respect and give up their seats and opportunities when appropriate to a woman, especially women of color who often go unnoticed.\n\nBonus Questions:\n\nThe mountain I’m willing to die on… is a marathon of Seinfeld.\n\nI wish people would stop telling me… to go back to my country. BROOKLYN IS MY COUNTRY.\n\nThis interview is part of How We’ll Win, a project exploring the fight for gender equality at work. Read more interviews with industry-leading women here.\n",

          "description": "Engineer Ari Vaniderstine tweeted a link to a Glitch project called Nelson this morning, which is a browser application that lets Spotify users fiddle with various inputs in the recommendation API and make their own algorithmically generated playlists.\n\nIf you have a Spotify premium account, you can select a mix of genres from a long list that includes, for some reason, “pop-movie” but not rap, and then dictate the other parameters of the playlist with the sliders provided for nine other “audio features.” These features are explained on Spotify’s developer blog:\n\nAcousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n\nDanceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n\nEnergy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. \n\nInstrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal.” The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n\nLiveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n\nSpeechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n\nTempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\nValence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\nIt doesn’t work great — I put in blues, R&B, rainy day, singer-songwriter, and soul, and got a playlist with two Mumford & Sons songs on it — but there’s something satisfying about sliding the bars around at random and watching the program panic-switch between Carly Rae Jepsen and James Brown. \n\nI tried it out with a bunch of different combinations and got mostly terrible recommendations, but still had a great time. What else do you have going on? Make yourself some half-human, half-algorithm cyborg playlists with Nelson. \n",

          "description": "Domestic first class is nicer than coach, but, in most cases, it’s hardly something to write home about.  Usually you’ll simply get a bigger seat and a few snacks and drinks, or a meal if you’re lucky.  If you’re really lucky, you might find yourself on an internationally configured aircraft flying a domestic route.  On these you’ll generally find large business class seats with electronic controls to adjust the recline all the way to flat if you’d like.  Additionally, the big three airlines (AA, Delta, United) have rolled out premium business class seating on a number of their transcontinental routes (LAX to JFK, for example).  Of course, they have also rolled out higher award prices for those transcon business class seats.\n\nIf you’d like to fly first class (who wouldn’t?), it is often possible to pay fewer miles by booking with foreign carrier miles.  Below you’ll find domestic business/first class award prices for each of the big three, along with the best options for using foreign miles, and quick tips for how to get those miles.\n\nKeep in mind that in all cases you’ll have to find saver level award space on the airline you want to fly before you can book that flight with a partner airline’s miles.\n\nFly AA Domestic Business or First Class\n\nAA premium transcon\n\nAmerican Airlines charges 25K one-way for 2-cabin first class, or 32.5K one-way business class.  Here are the best alternatives:\n\nJAL (Japan Airlines Mileage Bank): 32K to 42K round-trip (or one-way) for flights totaling 4,000 miles or less.\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles: 30K to 50K round-trip depending upon the length of the flight (use this online calculator to find the price).\n\nEtihad Guest: 25K one-way for business / first class. 32.5K one-way for “Premium” (note: I’m not sure if premium in this case means transcon business class or 3 cabin first class. My guess is the latter). Etihad’s award chart for flying AA can be found here.\n\nBritish Airways Avios: 15K one-way for short (up to 1,150 miles) direct flights.\n\nMy take: For round trip travel, JAL and Cathay Pacific offer great award prices. JAL allows booking AA awards directly online. Cathay allows making an award request online, but the award is confirmed offline.  Overall, Cathay may be the best choice despite the more cumbersome award booking procedure because their miles are easy to get.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nAA: Sign up for Citi AA cards or Barclaycard AA cards; or transfer from SPG/Marriott.\n\nJAL: Transfer from SPG.\n\nCathay Pacific: Sign up for Cathay credit card; or transfer from Citi ThankYou Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, or SPG.\n\nEtihad Guest: Transfer from Citi ThankYou Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, or SPG.\n\nBritish Airways: Sign up for the Chase British Airways credit card; or transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, or SPG/Marriott.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nBooking Tip for booking AA with JAL miles:\n\nJAL’s Mileage Bank program has a distance based award chart.  With most domestic flights, JAL requires only 32,000 to 42,000 miles to fly business class or two-cabin first class on American Airlines or Alaska Airlines.  Longer flights such as LAX to JFK roundtrip exceed the 4,000 mile sweetspot, but you could fly LAX to JFK then return as far as Dallas (for example) in first or business class for as few as 42,000 miles. You can search for award availability online through JAL’s site, but you must sign up for a free account first.\n\nFly Delta Domestic Business or First Class\n\nDelta premium transcon\n\nDelta no longer publishes an award chart, so the best you can do to find their award pricing is use Delta’s award calendar to try to find the best rates.   At the time of this writing I’ve found that Delta domestic first class and business class awards range from 17.5K to 53K one-way.  Here are the best alternatives:\n\nVirgin Atlantic: 25K one-way for direct flights (if a flight requires multiple segments, the award price is higher).  See this post for tips on booking Delta awards with Virgin Atlantic awards.\n\nKorean Air: 45K round-trip.  See this post for tips on booking Delta awards with Korean Air miles.\n\nMy take: For round trip travel Korean Air has terrific prices, but their online booking tool is a challenge to use.  They also have rules against booking awards for anyone but family members and you have to prove that they’re really in your family.  Virgin Atlantic’s website is a bit buggy, but it’s much easier to use than Korean’s and it includes a useful award calendar.  Plus, Virgin Atlantic miles are much easier to collect than Korean Air miles.  And, best of all, Virgin Atlantic sometimes finds award space on Delta that other Delta partners cannot see.  If you’re planning to fly direct, the slight premium Virgin Atlantic charges over Korean Air is, in my opinion, completely worth it.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nDelta: Sign up for Delta credit cards; or transfer from Amex Membership Rewards or SPG/Marriott.\n\nVirgin Atlantic: Sign up for the Virgin Atlantic card; or transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or SPG/Marriott.\n\nKorean Air: Sign up for Korean Air credit cards; or transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards, or SPG.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nTip for booking Delta awards with Virgin Atlantic miles:\n\nVirgin Atlantic’s website award booking tool auto-completes your typing in the leftmost box titled “I’m flying From”, but not the one on the right titled “To” except for select Virgin Atlantic airport destinations.  An easy workaround is to click the little map pin icon to search by country or alphabetically.  Another workaround is to type your destination into the “from” box and copy and paste the result into the “To” box.  Most, if not all, US airports can be found this way, but many international destinations that Delta serves are not available online.  For these, you have to call Virgin Atlantic to find and book awards.\n\nFly United Domestic Business or First Class\n\nUnited premium transcon\n\nUnited charges 25K one-way 2-cabin first class, or 35K one-way premium transcon business class.  Here are the best alternatives:\n\nLufthansa Miles & More: 17K one-way\n\nSingapore: 20K one-way\n\nAeroplan (Air Canada): 25K one-way\n\nMy take: Both Lufthansa and Singapore require calling to book award flights on United.  I’ve never booked with Lufthansa miles, but I’ve done so a number of times with Singapore.  For me, they’ve always answered quickly and were a pleasure to deal with.  Since Singapore miles are much easier to get than Lufthansa miles, I think that Singapore is worth the slight premium in award costs.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nUnited: Sign up for United credit cards; or transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards or SPG/Marriott.\n\nLufthansa: Sign up for the Miles & More credit card; or transfer from SPG.\n\nSingapore: Transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or SPG.\n\nAeroplan: Transfer from Amex Membership Rewards or SPG.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nUnited Booking Tip:\n\nBefore trying to book with a foreign carrier’s miles (especially when they don’t let you book United flights online), look for business/first class award space on United.com without logging in.  Look for First Saver Award space (or Business Saver Award space on a 3 cabin flight) that looks like this:\n\nFly Alaska First Class\n\nThis section is coming soon.  For now note that you can book Alaska flights with partners such as AA, Cathay Pacific, and Korean Air.\n\n \n\nEarn Miles Without Flying: START HERE\t\n\nThe post Best options for domestic first class awards appeared first on Frequent Miler.",

          "description": "I grew up in Houston, Texas, home to some of the best fried chicken in the world. It’s crackly and slick and the skin falls off with a flourish of steam that reveals a tender inside. Quality fried chicken is ubiquitous in this corner of the South, but one establishment rises above the rest: Since 1969,\nFrenchy’s has been doling out the tastiest fried birds in the city. Don’t believe me? Just ask Beyoncé.\n\nFried chicken, as convention dictates in the American South, is always dredged in buttermilk and flour—it’s this crucial combination that gives that signature browned crunch. But while I, and many others, may be staunch traditionalists, there’s technically more than one way to make fried chicken. In fact, there’s a whole slew of methods. So many that you could practically travel the world in fried chicken dishes alone, so grab your passport and let’s get going.\n\nNorth America\n\nHere are two go-tos for Southern-style fried chicken. There’s plenty of buttermilk and plenty of oil. Michael Ruhlman’s recipe recommends brining the chicken first in a tart and tangy rosemary-lemon brine. This gives the meat some flavor and succulence before being tossed into the fryer.\n\nMichael Ruhlman's Rosemary-Brined, Buttermilk Fried Chicken\nby Genius Recipes\n\nButtermilk Fried Chicken\nby Ashley Rodriguez\n\nFor the oil averse (or those who just can’t be bothered to fry on a weeknight), get cracking on this inventive “fried” chicken technique. It calls for an oven instead. Crank it up to 400° F and give those dredged bites a good crisp.\n\nJudy Hesser’s Oven-Fried Chicken\nby Genius Recipes\n\nNashville’s signature fried chicken rendition is sharp and spicy. For this recipe, it’s all about the hot maple sauce—sweet syrup with a cayenne kick. Serve it all atop a pillowy waffle for the ultimate breakfast, brunch, lunch, or any-kind-of-time meal.\n\nHot Chicken and Jalapeño Bacon Cheddar Waffle\nby Karrie / Tasty Ever After\n\nIndia\n\nThis Indian-inspired take on fried chicken comes to us from Asha Gomez, the master when it comes to mashing up Southern and South Asian recipes. Her chicken batter is laden with chiles and contains a special secret ingredient: mint!\n\nAsha Gomez's Kerala Fried Chicken\nby Food52\n\nMichelle Peters-Jones of The Tiffin Box had this to say about her recipe: \"Chicken 65 might have an unusual name, but it’s actually the name of one of the most popular bar snacks in Southern India. Unlike other well-known Indian chicken dishes—like tandoori style and chicken lollipops—this crunchy, fiery, and completely addictive chicken is traditionally made from spicy, marinated chicken pieces that are deep fried, then quickly sautéed again in a spicy yogurt and curry leaf sauce.\"\n\nChicken 65 (Indian Fried Chicken)\nby Michelle Peters - Jones\n\nThailand\n\nThis Thai recipe is derived from the famed fried chicken served at Soi Polo, a Bangkok institution. They serve their bird with a crispy skin and top it with even crispier garlic flakes. The recipe is fairly simple and doesn’t require any dredge, just two whole heads (!) of garlic instead. Serve this with a side of sweet and spicy Thai chile sauce.\n\nFried Chicken with Crispy Garlic (Kai Thot Kra-Thiam Krop)\nby Leela Punyaratabandhu\n\nChina\n\nFor a fried chicken approach that is a little less involved—and takes half the time—try this one. This Chinese method calls for coating the chicken bits in cornstarch before tossing them into hot oil. Fried chicken for the weeknight warrior.\n\nChinese Chicken with Black Pepper Sauce\nby Palatable Pastime\n\nKorea\n\nAh, the ever-beloved Korean fried chicken. This take goes light on the dredge (just flour) but heavy on the glaze. Smear a sticky, sweet, spicy ginger-soy glaze across these bad boys and dig in.\n\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings (KFC)\nby ravenouscouple\n\nScared of splatter? Fear no more, the Frywall is here!

          "description": "After reading Jordan Peterson’s 12 rules, a few people asked me what my list would look like.  I would stress that what follows is not a universal or eternally valid account, but rather a few ideas that strike me in the here and now, perhaps as the result of recent conversations.  I suspect the same is true for everyone’s rules lists, so please keep this in perspective.  Here goes:\n\n1. Assume your temperament will always be somewhat childish and impatient, and set your rules accordingly, knowing that you cannot abide by rules for rules sake.  Hope to leverage your impatience toward your longer-run advantage.\n\n2. Study the symbolic systems of art, music, literature. and religion, if only to help yourself better understand alternative points of view in political and intellectual discourse.  Don’t just spend time with the creations you like right away.  Avoid “devalue and dismiss.”\n\n3. When the price goes up, buy less.  Try to understand what the price really is, however, and good luck with that.\n\n4. Marry well.\n\n5. Organize at least some significant portion of your knowledge of the world in terms of place, whether by country, region, or city.  If you do that, virtually every person will be interesting to you, if only because almost everyone has some valuable knowledge of particular places.\n\n6. When shooting the basketball, give it more arc than you think is necessary.  Consistently.\n\n7. Learn how to learn from those who offend you.\n\n8. Cultivate mentors, and be willing to serve as mentors to others.  This never loses its importance.\n\n9. I don’t know.\n\n10. Heed Cowen’s Three Laws.\n\n11. Do not heed Cowen’s Three Laws.\n\n12. Every now and then read or reread Erasmus, Montaigne, Homer, Shakespeare, or Joyce’s Ulysses, so that you do not take any rules too seriously.  The human condition seems to defeat our attempts to order it.\n\nThe post Tyler Cowen’s 12 rules for life appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",

Suddenly a yellow package drops out of the sky as if sent by a god, hits the water next to you and expands into a flotation device.\n\nThat was the experience of two unlucky, then lucky teenage boys off the coast of Lennox Head in Australia last week. Someone spotted the boys in distress and called it in, but the nearest lifeguard station was a kilometer away. Just that morning, however, Lennox Head had brought their new lifesaving drone into service.\n\nIn a little over a minute, a lifeguard supervisor had launched the drone, spotted the boys, flew it over to them, and remotely dropped the flotation device. The boys were able to grab it and swim to shore. Here's the footage:\n\nThe drone is manufactured by a company called Little Ripper Lifesaver, founded by Kevin Weldon after he witnessed a drone canvassing the streets of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and realized its lifesaving potential. The Marine Pod dropped over Lennox Head contained a water-triggered flotation device, which is repackable and reusable. The company is now testing a saltwater-activated electromagnetic shark repellent device, with plans to include that in future kits.\n\nLittle Ripper also makes a Land Pod, which contains an automatic defibrillator, a location beacon, a thermal blanket, a radio, a highly-visible rescue banner and a first aid kit. Lastly they make a Snow Pod, which adds skin warmers and energy bars to the Land Pod.\n\nLennox Head received the drone as part of a trial set up by an organization called Surf Life Saving NSW and the New South Wales Government. According to ABC News,\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW project manager for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Kelvin Morton, said the project was a world-first.\n\n\"These UAVs that we're using to drop these inflatable pods is innovative, and we know that most or all of the lifesaving organisations around the world are stepping back and waiting to see how this goes.\"\n\nMr Morton said the drones gave surf lifesavers a new advantage. \"It gives them eyes across the water at a height of 60 metres and they can move at 50 kilometres an hour,\" he said. \n\n\"They've never had that ability before. They can see things in the water that a jet-ski simply cannot.\"\n",

          "description": "Some folks claim that if you do what you love, the money will follow. Others say that a job is just a job — you’re not meant to like it. The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. There are few things worse than a job you hate; and many people enjoy fun, fulfilling careers while earning a good living.\n\nWhatever the case, any job is more bearable if you’re paid well. Plus, a high wage means more money to pursue your goals and dreams. One of the best ways to increase your income is at the source: during salary negotiations when you land a job.\n\nWhy You Should Negotiate Your Salary\n\nFor many people, salary negotiations are awkward or scary. But in his book Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1000 a Minute, career coach Jack Chapman argues that those few minutes during which you ask for more money in an interview can make a difference of tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. Maybe even hundreds of thousands. He says you can literally earn $1,000 per minute if you do this right.\n\nResearch backs him up. According to a 2010 study conducted by George Mason University and Temple University, failing to negotiate on an initial job offer could mean missing out on over $600,000 in salary during a typical career.\n\n“We spend years thinking about what we’ll be when we grow up,” Chapman writes. “But when it’s time for a raise, most of us just accept whatever we’re offered. How many minutes do we spend negotiating the money? Zero.”\n\nOnly about half of all applicants negotiate their salary; don’t be one of these folks. If you don’t ask for more money, your employer certainly won’t just give it to you.\n\nBefore we look specifically at negotiating salary, let’s review the basics of negotiation in general.\n\nYou Can Negotiate Anything\n\nIn his book You Can Negotiate Anything, Herb Cohen writes that there are three crucial variables in every negotiation:\n\nPower, or the ability to get things done. In salary negotiations, you gain power from perceived expertise or legitimacy. The better qualified you are for a position, the more leverage your have. You also gain power through persistence, attitude, and taking calculated risks. You have power if you’re willing to walk away; if you’re not, the company can name its price.\n\nTime. In negotiations, the side with the most time generally has an advantage. No matter how much pressure you’re under, always keep your cool, maintaining an appearance of calm. Having other options buys you time. You’re in a better bargaining position if you already have a job (or job offer) and don’t need to accept his one. When you believe you have to have something, the other side can easily manipulate you.\n\nInformation is the final piece of the puzzle. The more you know, the stronger your position. Do your research before you negotiate. During negotiations, act on whatever new info comes to light. The interviewer’s questions, responses, and attitude all give you valuable information.\n\nNow let’s look at two (very similar) methods for negotiating your salary.\n\nNote: Remember that these techniques are generally applicable for discussions during a performance review. You can use these ideas to ask for a raise, not just to negotiate your salary for a new position.\n\nHow to Negotiate Your Salary\n\nIn Negotiating Your Salary, Jack Chapman offers five rules for getting what you want.\n\nFirst, postpone salary negotiations until after you’ve been offered a job (or finished a performance review). Chapman says the hiring (or evaluation) process consists of two phases: judging and budgeting. You can only hurt yourself by dealing with salary when the employer is judging instead of budgeting.\n\nSecond, let the other side make the first offer. According to Chapman, it’s tough to win by being the first to name a number. For many people, it can be awkward to evade direct questions about salary expectations. Chapman recommends preparing for this situation. His website includes a short video on how to answer the question, “What are you earning?” (You might also read Penelope Trunk’s advice on how to answer the toughest interview question.)\n\nWhen you hear the offer, repeat the top value — and then be silent. “The most likely outcome of this silence is a raise,” Chapman writes. This technique buys you some time to think while putting pressure on the employer.\n\nNext, counter the offer with a researched response. Your next move is to make a counter-offer based on what you know about yourself, the market, and the company. Before you go into the interview, have a minimum salary in mind. Base this on careful research using tools like LinkedIn, Salary.com, CareerBliss.com, PayScale.com, and GlassDoor.com. Also take the time to ask friends and colleagues for confidential feedback on what the position you want ought to pay. This information will give you power.\n\nFinally, clinch the deal — then deal some more. The final step in salary negotiations is to lock in the offer, and then negotiate additional benefits. This is like locking in the price of the car you’re buying before you begin negotiating the value of your trade-in.\n\nThe Noel Smith-Wenkle Salary Negotiation Method\n\nChapman isn’t the only one espousing these techniques. My research shows that all effective headhunters and coaches essentially advocate the same salary negotiation process.\n\nFor instance, Noel Smith-Wenkle was a job headhunter during the 1980s. He developed the following method to get as much money for his clients as possible during salary negotiations (which, in turn, meant a greater commission for him).\n\nSmith-Wenkle’s number-one rule is: never tell the employer how much you’ll take. Let the company name the first number. (Chapman gives the same advice. So does almost every other negotiation coach.)\n\nThe Smith-Wenkle Salary Negotiation Method involves four carefully prepared responses:\n\nIf the company asks for a salary expectation on the application, leave it blank.\n\nWhen the company verbally asks how much you want, say, “I’m much more interested in doing [type of work] here at [name of company] than I am in the size of the initial offer.” Smith-Wenkle says this will work about 40% of the time.\n\nIf the company asks a second time, your answer should be: “I will consider any reasonable offer.” This is a polite stalling tactic, and Smith-Wenkle says this will work another 30% of the time.\n\nAbout 30% of the time, you’ll have to respond again. (Smart hiring managers know they shouldn’t be the first to make an offer.) Again, your response is a polite refusal to answer the question: “You’re in a much better position to know how much I’m worth to you than I am.” This is your final answer, no matter how many times the company tries to get you to go first.\n\nThe sole purpose of this method is to get the company to be the first side to name a number. Once the company makes an offer, you have two options. If the offer is above your minimum, take the job. If it’s below your minimum, tell them it’s too low — but don’t say by how much.\n\nMore Info on Salary Negotiation\n\nOver the past decade, I’ve talked to several people about how they’ve successfully negotiated their salaries. All of them have stressed two factors: preparation and practice.\n\nRemember that the purpose of a job interview (or performance review) is to sell yourself. If you don’t believe you’re worth the price you’re asking, your employer won’t believe it either.\n\nDraft a list of ways you’ve helped current and past employers. Measure your achievements in dollar terms, if you can. (For instance: “By finding a new supplier for our packaging supplies, I’ve saved the firm $50,000 over the past year.”) Create a written list of talking points and use this to make your case for a higher salary.\n\nIf you’re just starting out – you’re a recent university graduate or moving to a new career – you might not have hard numbers to prove your worth. In that case, pitch your enthusiasm and work ethic.\n\nAnd the practice portion? Don’t let the actual interview be the first time you try your “flinch” or try to deflect questions about salary. As silly as it might sound, take some time to role-play with your spouse or a friend. Have them take the role of hiring manager and ask them to grill you so that you can see what it feels like to handle common questions. (For added fun, turn the tables and you take the role of hiring manager.)\n\nNegotiating your salary is one of the best ways to improve your financial position. And it’s a move that can have an enormous impact on your financial future. When you negotiate a better salary on this job, that number will help you when you negotiate the salary for your next job. It’s like a giant snowball of money! And it’s a snowball you can directly influence by making it as big as possbile at the beginning.\n\nWant more info on how to negotiate salary? Pick up a copy of Jack Chapman’s Negotiating Your Salary (which has helped many GRS readers over the years). Also take a look at this free PDF report from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. The “Ask a Manager” blog is packed with employment tips, including this article on what to say when you negotiate salary. Finally, Ramit Sethi offers a free one-day mini-course on negotiation, which includes tips for negotiating your salary.\n\nThe post How to negotiate your salary (and earn an extra half-million dollars in your lifetime) appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",

          "description": "Looking for a last-minute winter getaway? Put Mexico City at the top of your list. The bustling metropolis—and the World Design Capital of 2018—has bounced back from September’s earthquake. You could spend at least a week eating your way through its many food halls and local markets, visiting museums (it’s home to more than any other city in the world), and wandering its tree-lined neighborhoods. While there are top-notch hotels, Airbnb is often the more affordable way to go. And as you’ll see from this list, stays are often super stylish and come with incredible outdoor space.\n\nValue Deals (Less than $150)\n\n1. Serene 19th-Century Studio\n\nThis one-bedroom, one-bathroom studio is ideal for couples that want to cozy up in a quiet escape. It’s a bit outside of the popular areas of Condesa and Roma, but that only adds to its romantic appeal. (Plus, Uber can get you anywhere fast and cheap.) The space is compact, yet the owner designed it with care, outfitting it with bright red bar stools, a white-tiled kitchen, and a lounger that faces a private garden oasis that’s teeming with plants. A staircase leads up to a simple yet comfortable sleeping area. What’s more, the price is hard to beat. Rates from $67 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\n2. Colonial Stay in Centro\n\nMexico City’s historic center brims with history and things to see and do, including the Bellas Artes, National Palace, and Zócalo (or main square)—and this restored 18th-century one-bedroom, one-bath hacienda puts you right in the thick of it. Its all-white interior is paired with light wood furniture, making it feel clean, fresh, and very hotel-like. The apartment (which is big enough for four) is connected to the one-bedroom Casa El Santo by an interior garden, and they can be rented together for larger groups. The hosts also manage a number of other Airbnbs in the area that can hold up to seven guests. And they can provide you with a cellphone upon request. Rates from $102 per night, minimum-night stay varies\n\n \n\n3. Modern Condo in Cuauhtémoc\n\nThe No. 1 rule of real estate—location, location, location—applies to this spacious two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom rental in the Cuauhtémoc neighborhood, which is close to Condesa, Roma, all the sights in Chapultepec park (including the National Museum of Anthropology) as well as the Centro Histórico. There’s plenty of space for four guests, and it’s a design-lover’s haven, with a globe-like hanging light fixture, framed art propped against the wall, wooden platform beds, and open shelving in the kitchen. The terrace—complete with a green wall—has a hammock in case the desire for a mid-day nap strikes. Rates from $113 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\n Mid-Tier ($150 to $250)\n\n4. Roma Town House\n\nChances are good that having the tuna tostadas at Contramar is on your must-do list—and this bi-level rental is right across the street. Inside, you’ll find a Luis Barragan-style floating staircase, bright pink accent walls, and three large and contemporary rooms (plus 2.5 baths) that can accommodate a total of eight people. There are also two living rooms and a terrace, which means plenty of communal spaces to hang out when you’re not exploring the city. Rates from $250 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\n5. Sunny Condesa Apartment\n\nThose looking to stay in what is perhaps the city’s buzziest neighborhood should book this modern, two-bed, 2.5-bath apartment in Condesa, where just about every street is lined with restaurants, bars, and boutiques. (And travelers who need to get some work done will appreciate the two desk areas, one equipped with an Apple computer and printer.) Floor-to-ceiling windows give it tons of natural light, and there’s a roof garden outfitted with a Weber grill and enough seating for eight. If anything happens to go wrong, the hosts or one of their mangers are known to respond within minutes. (They also have two other rentals in the same building, in case you’re traveling with a big group.) Rates from $163 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\n High Roller ($250+ per night)\n\n6. San Miguel Chapultepec Penthouse\n\nSet in the picturesque mostly-residential neighborhood of San Miguel Chapultepec, this light-filled seventh-floor apartment has soaring windows and three spacious rooms with king beds, making it large enough to fit six more than comfortably. There’s a beautiful open kitchen and dining room that overlooks the city, plus a living room with a white couch, stone coffee table, and traditional Balinese love seat. Among the other amenities: an over-sized terrace, parking space, 24-hour security, and a Nespresso machine. Rates from $308 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\n7. San Angel Artist Studio\n\nThe architect and muralist Juan O’Gorman used to live and work out of this 1939 two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom home in San Angel, a beautiful residential neighborhood just south of city. (A block away, O’Gorman built twin houses and studios for Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, which have been preserved as a museum.) It’s eclectically decorated, with a blue-and-white checkered couch, colorful throw pillows, and patterned rugs and tapestries. It can accommodate up to six guests, and while in residence, the hosts sleep in a bedroom on the opposite side of the garden, and you may see them in the kitchen during meal times. (A continental breakfast can be provided on request.) Rates from $338 per night; minimum-night stay varies.\n\nThe Showstopper ($500+ per night)\n\n8. An Art Lover’s Dream in Polanco\n\nThis is your chance to stay in the former studio of the late Mexican painter and muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. An elevator opens directly into the sleek and stylish three-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom apartment (for up to eight guests), which is done up in mid-century furniture, shiny wood floors, and original local art. It’s located just north of lush Chapultepec park—and there’s a terrace from which to take in the view, a mezcal or beer from the welcome kit in hand. And should you need help with restaurant reservations, babysitting services, or even a private chef, a concierge is available 24/7. Rates from $567 per night, minimum-night stay varies.\n\nMaximize Your Purchase\n\nThere are plenty of ways to maximize your stay with points and miles. If you’ve never used Airbnb before, sign up through TPG to get $40 off your first booking — and the gravy train doesn’t stop there. Book through the Delta portal and earn 1 SkyMile for every dollar spent on your stay, and make sure to charge the purchase to a travel rewards card to rack up extra points. Using a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred will get you 2x points on all travel purchases while the Chase Sapphire Reserve will get you 3x points on an Airbnb stay. When you combine the two, you’re effectively double-dipping with your points earning. \n\nPrices are accurate as of publication date but are subject to change.

          "description": "As a mother and the founder and CEO of a digital health company, I frequently get asked about “work-life balance.” My husband, Lee Teslik, an executive at Google, who changes as many diapers as I do, has had a very different experience. We’ve never really talked about this dynamic before, so one recent Sunday afternoon while our son was napping, we tape-recorded a conversation about the subject. The following is an excerpt—with all expletives, politics, and tears edited out.\n\nKate: Since becoming a parent, how many times have you been asked, “how do you do it all?”\n\nLee: I’ve never been asked that.\n\nKate: Wow, really? I get asked that like once per week. Why do you think that is?\n\nLee: I don’t know, but there’s clearly an overall expectation that the burden of raising children falls primarily to women. And, obviously, people think that for a reason—which is that most women actually do spend more time than their husbands on childcare. But the assumption also reinforces the gender dynamics.\n\nKate: This is kind of fun, we’ve actually never directly talked about this.\n\nLee: What are your reactions when you get asked that question?\n\nKate: It depends on the context. If I’m at a work dinner and I’m talking about work and life in a one-on-one conversation, I’m happy to talk about it and learn about whomever I’m talking to from that same lens, man or woman. But when I’m talking on a panel or in a group situation about business, and I’m the only woman, and someone asks me specifically, I get uncomfortable because it’s distracting from what I’m there to talk about.\n\nLee: …which is business.\n\nKate: Yeah, exactly. If you were asked that question by strangers in a business setting, how would you respond?\n\nLee: I would be surprised. But I would probably say two things. First, that I’ve actually made some career choices to enable me to be a better and more present parent. In my old job [at McKinsey & Company], I used to travel almost all the time.\n\nKate: I hated that.\n\nLee: Yeah, seriously. That’s why I left. I’d also probably talk about how it’s a constant negotiation between the two of us. Like who is going to be home at 6:30 on any given night? When we have conflicting work events, whose work event trumps the other? Or do we need a babysitter? It’s just constant communication—which I think we’re fine at, but probably could be better.\n\nKate: Yeah, actually, I just had a board meeting and Theo [our son] was up all night puking, and you stayed home with him that morning! Thanks for that.\n\nLee: And you? How do you answer the “how do you do it all” question?\n\nKate: Well at this point, it follows a script [Laughs] I usually say “not gracefully” and then change the subject back to whatever I was talking about. Or, if it’s too awkward to answer it like that and I need to get into it more, I usually say something about having a supportive husband, family, and community.\n\nKate: Do you think our parental duties are even?\n\nLee: No. But I’m also not sure that’s the right way to frame it.\n\nKate: Please elaborate.\n\nLee: I think you and I have a wide variety of administrative tasks for our household— which includes a lot of childcare but also a lot of other things, like cooking, work around the house, and dealing with the car. I think the real question isn’t the split of childcare but the split of all that activity. I get frustrated at articles that frame this question solely around childcare. That said, I do think net/net you do more, and we definitely could be more even.\n\nKate: Do you think it will change as our kids get older?\n\nLee: I hope it does. I feel like you had such a strong biological bond with Theo in the first year, and there were some things, like breastfeeding, that you naturally had to spend more time on.\n\nKate: Right. And it’s important to acknowledge those things. I get annoyed sometimes when I am talking to people about women’s health in the prenatal and postpartum period and they try to make it an equal endeavor between men and women to physically grow a child, have the child, and then feed the child. My body did all that work! It fundamentally is different, and I think dads, companies, and more broadly society can do more to make this incredibly important time better for mothers.\n\nLee: So let’s talk about that. Google gives more leave to women than men, which I would say is fair. But how do you ensure women don’t get screwed on the back-end of that because they’re missing more work?\n\nKate: You need good back-to-work programs and manager training – that’s a core part of our maternity program at Maven and how we work with companies. You need to help the culture of a company understand the pregnancy penalty and the issues moms face.\n\nLee: But tactically. How do you do that? How do you make sure women don’t get implicitly punished in their career progression for taking more time off?\n\nKate: Maven can help! No really, it’s a complicated issue, and I actually just asked my friend this the other night. She took 12 months off at a major investment company after having her daughter, and she said she had an exceptional manager who made sure her work wasn’t swallowed up by her colleagues and always checked in with her to keep her in the loop. I think you need to systematize this and not have it be based on one-off managers.\n\nLee: So you’re pregnant again right now. What have you done differently this time around from a work context?\n\nKate: I have thoughts but am curious for yours first. What am I doing differently?\n\nLee: I think you’re less nervous this time around for being judged negatively for being pregnant, which maybe is a function of Maven being bigger. For instance, you hid it longer the first time around.\n\nKate: I was showing this time at 3 months! I had no choice. I think you’re right, I am basically more fatalistic about it. If I’m judged, I’m judged. Whereas the first time around, I tried to assert more control over that. There’s only so much you can control in life!\n\nLee: That makes it sound like you think it’s just inevitable that you’ll be judged.\n\nKate: That’s right. [Pause]. OK, let’s move on to rapid fire questions: Who drinks more?\n\nLee: You\n\nKate: Who sleeps more?\n\nLee: Me\n\nKate: Who goes out more?\n\nLee: You\n\nKate: How often do you exercise?\n\nLee: Not enough.\n\nKate: What percentage of doctors’ appointments do you come to?\n\nLee: Most.\n\nKate: Who deals with child care emergencies more?\n\nLee: I honestly think it’s a good mix and that your family is critical here too. Wait, I have some for you!\n\nLee: What do you miss most about being a non-parent?\n\nKate: Spontaneous travel.\n\nLee: How many times per week do you FaceTime with Theo?\n\nKate: Oh god, a lot. Even sometimes when I’m just catching the subway home and I’ll see him in 20 minutes. I’m obsessed with him.\n\nLee: Okay, final question. How do you do it all?\n\nKate: Not gracefully.\n\nKate Ryder is the CEO of Maven.\n",

          "description": "The morning routines of the most powerful and accomplished people are commonly scrutinized and emulated in the hope of replicating their productivity. For those who struggle to get started in the morning, studying their schedules tends to generate shame.\n\nSo it is particularly refreshing to learn that the world’s most powerful person, Donald Trump, doesn’t get to work till 11 am. Before his official schedule begins, according to Axios writer Jonathan Swan, the president takes at least three hours every morning for “executive time” in the Oval Office.\n\nSwan describes this as “time in his residence, watching TV, making phone calls and tweeting.” Indeed, the president is a known early riser and morning tweeter. He also rejects working out, doesn’t read much, and has few hobbies beyond golf, so catching up on cable news and social media chatter during that time seems entirely plausible.\n\nUnless he is traveling, the president’s schedule includes a solid chunk of “executive time” between 8 am and 11 am, and then more of it through the day. This doesn’t necessarily mean he’s not working, but in Swan’s words, he spends the hours “generally taking the same loose, improvisational approach to being president that he took to running the Trump Organization for so many years.”\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders notes that “the time in the morning is a mix of residence time and Oval Office time but he always has calls with staff, Hill members, cabinet members and foreign leaders during this time.”\n\nMost Popular\n\n\t\tRead full story\n",

          "description": "Many sheet pan chicken recipes are deceptively alluring. They breezily suggest you fill your trusty sheet pan full of chicken and assorted ingredients, put it in the oven, go do whatever you need to do (laundry, exercise, you name it!), and come back later to a perfectly cooked, wholesome dinner. But when drawn in by this promise, I’m usually let down. Sometimes the chicken is done way before the vegetables (or vice versa), the ingredients steam instead of brown, or the whole deal takes a lot more time in the oven than advertised. This set-it-and-forget-about-it approach works well for slow cookers, but not for one-pan chicken dinners, which need more care and attention to coax out the best flavors of very different ingredients.\n\nSo I did what I do whenever I want a better approach: I set out on a little research project, gathering tips and tricks for better sheet pan chicken from smart people across the food world. I combined the best strategies into one recipe—this roasted sheet pan chicken with broccoli, chickpeas, and parmesan. It’s speedier, crispier sheet pan chicken, with lots of boldly-flavored ingredients to keep the meal square and interesting. The tips and tricks behind this dinner’s deliciousness are listed below, in the order that they’re used in the recipe.\n\nSheet Pan Chicken With Broccoli, Chickpeas, and Parmesan\nby EmilyC\n\n1. Add baking powder for better browning. Dry the chicken well (I like to use bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs) and rub a mixture of baking powder, salt, and other seasonings all over the chicken to promote browning and crispier skin. It’s a trick often used for chicken wings. Baking powder raises the chicken’s pH level so the proteins break down more efficiently, leading to better browning (via Serious Eats).\n\n2. Sear the chicken in the oven. Place an empty sheet pan in the oven while it heats to 500° F. Start the chicken skin-side down on the hot sheet pan (it’ll sizzle and start to sear when it hits the pan), then lower the heat to 425° F. Wait about 15 minutes before flipping the chicken, or until the fat from the skin has rendered (via Simply Recipes Sheet Pan Chicken with Roasted Broccoli and Potatoes).\n\n3. Add big, bold flavors. Add diced preserved lemon peel to the pan drippings to up the boldness, brightness, and complexity of the whole dish (via Canal House’s Chicken Thighs with Lemon).\n\n4. Stagger entry of ingredients. Nestle the broccoli, chickpeas, and sun-dried tomatoes amongst the chicken thighs after they’ve been flipped. For best results, cut the broccoli into really small pieces to create more surface area for browning and ensure a quick roast (via Melissa Clark and many others).\n\n5. Boost browning (again!). Sprinkle parmesan over the entire dish for its final roasting time to enhance browning and flavor (via Diana Henry’s One Pot Parmesan Roast Chicken and Cauliflower).\n\n6. Crisp vegetables while the chicken rests. Spread the broccoli, chickpeas, and sun-dried tomatoes evenly across the sheet pan (tossing them a few times in the pan drippings) and return them to the oven for a few extra minutes; they’ll get browner, crispier, and more delicious.\n\nThere are a few steps to getting here, hassle-free.\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nThanks to the rocket-hot sheet pan, this is one of the speediest sheet pan chicken dinners I’ve made. The high heat not only benefits the chicken but the broccoli, chickpeas, and sun-dried tomatoes, too (the little bits of crispy-chewy, almost burnt sun-dried tomatoes are absolutely addictive). Set a timer twice when making this dinner—the first time to remind yourself to flip the chicken, and the second time to check its doneness—so there are no surprises, or burnt dinner!\n\nThis may not be a set-it-and-forget-about type of dinner, but it’s simple to make and can be on the table in less than an hour. With a little attention to detail (and a few smart tricks), all of us can consistently prepare a better sheet pan chicken dinner. And with results this good, the laundry can always wait until tomorrow.\n\nSheet Pan Chicken With Broccoli, Chickpeas, and Parmesan\n\nBy EmilyC\n\nFor chicken and spice rub:\n\n6\nchicken thighs, bone-in and skin-on (about 2.5 pounds total)\n\n2\nteaspoons kosher salt\n\n1/2\nteaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1\nteaspoon baking powder (not baking soda!!)\n\n2\nteaspoons paprika (smoked or regular)\n\n2\nteaspoons ground cumin\n\n1\ntablespoon olive oil\n\nFor rest of sheet pan:\n\n2\nmedium crowns of broccoli (about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds in total), thinly sliced into small florets\n\n1\n16-ounce can chickpeas (drained and rinsed)\n\n1/3\ncup sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil\n\n1\ntablespoon olive oil from sun-dried tomato container\n\n1/2\nteaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste\n\n2\ntablespoons finely diced preserved lemon peel (from one-half preserved lemon)\n\n1/3\ncup finely grated parmesan cheese\n\nA few wedges of lemon, if desired\n\nView Full Recipe",

These groups are huge—expect to read the word “hubby” a good bit—and they’re an excellent resource for general advice, tasty tips, and (of course) recipes. (You will have to request membership to join most of them but, if they’ll accept the likes of me, you should have no problem getting in.) Here are a few of our favorites:\n\nInstant Pot Beginner Recipes and Tips: This group is great for crowd-sourcing recipes, getting a grip on all those buttons and soothing your newbie jitters. \n\nInstant Pot Recipes—Tried and True!: As the name would suggest, the recipes posted in this group are ones that have been made and thoroughly enjoyed by members. They’re conveniently separated by thread, with straightforward topics like “breakfast,” “vegetables,” and “chicken.”\n\nInstant Pot Vegan Recipes: Everyone should eat more vegetables, and you don’t have to be vegan to enjoy all of the creative plant-based recipes offered in this group.\n\nInstant Pot Vietnamese Food Recipes: Quick, flavorful pho is the only reason you need to join this group, but be sure not too sleep on the Bo Kho, sticky rice, and milk tea.\n\n“Dump and Push Start” Easy Instant Pot Recipes: This group features only the easiest “fix-and-forget” recipes for unfussy, single-appliance meal making.\n\nInstant Pot for Indian Food: The Instant Pot makes short work of grains, legumes, and intensely-flavored sauces, lending itself extremely well to Indian cuisine. As someone who wishes to wean herself off of takeout, I find this group extremely exciting.\n\nThat should be enough to get you going and, of course, feel free to leave any IP successes in the comments below.

          "description": "Diets do not work.\n\nThe scientific evidence is clear as can be that cutting calories simply doesn’t lead to long-term weight loss or health gains.\n\nWe suspect most dieters have realized this by now too. And yet, here they are again, setting the same weight loss goal this year that they set last year.\n\nThe only people who don’t seem to appreciate this are people who have never dieted. It’s particularly hard for them to believe because it doesn’t square with their own eating experiences.\n\nTake Nicky, for instance. She eats sensibly much of the time, with some junk food here and there, but it doesn’t really seem to affect her weight. She’s not a dieter. She is Naturally Thin Nicky, and it’s not surprising that she believes what she sees with her own eyes and feels in her own body. Nevertheless, Nicky has it wrong.\n\nWe are researchers who have been studying why diets fail for a long time. We have seen that diet failure is the norm. We have also studied the stigma that heavy people face, and witnessed the blame game that happens when dieters can’t keep the weight off. From a scientific perspective, we understand that dieting sets up an unfair fight. But many Nickys we’ve encountered – on the street, in the audience when we give talks, and even fellow scientists – get confused when we say dieting doesn’t work, because it doesn’t square with their own observations.\n\nAn unfair fight\n\nNicky thinks she’s thin because of the way she eats, but actually, genetics play a huge role in making her thin. Nicky gets all the credit though, because people see the way she eats and they can’t see her genes.\n\nMany heavy people wouldn’t be lean like Nicky even if they ate the same foods in the same quantities. Their bodies are able to run on fewer calories than Nicky’s, which sounds like a good thing (and would be great if you found yourself in a famine).\n\nHowever, it actually means that after eating the same foods and using that energy to run the systems of their body, they have more calories left over to store as fat than Nicky does. So to actually lose weight, they have to eat less food than Nicky. And then, once they’ve been dieting a while, their metabolism changes so that they need to eat even less than that to keep losing weight.\n\nIt’s not just Nicky’s genetically given metabolism that makes her think dieting must work. Nicky, as a non-dieter, finds it really easy to ignore that bowl of Hershey’s Kisses on her co-worker’s desk. But for dieters, it’s like those Kisses are jumping up and down saying “Eat me!” Dieting causes neurological changes that make you more likely to notice food than before dieting, and once you notice it, these changes make it hard to stop thinking about it. Nicky might forget those chocolates are there, but dieters won’t.\n\nIn fact, dieters like them even more than before. This is because other diet-induced neurological changes make food not only taste better, but also cause food to give a bigger rush of the reward hormone dopamine. That’s the same hormone that is released when addicts use their drug of choice. Nicky doesn’t get that kind of rush from food.\n\nAnd besides, Nicky is full from lunch. Here again, dieters face an uphill battle because dieting has also changed their hormones. Their levels of the so-called satiety hormone leptin go down, which means that now it takes even more food than before to make them feel full. They felt hungry on their diets all along, but now feel even hungrier than before. Even Nicky’s regular non-diet lunch wouldn’t make dieters full at this point.\n\nWhere’s your willpower?\n\nPeople see Nicky and are impressed with her great self-control, or willpower. But should it really be considered self-control to avoid eating a food when you aren’t hungry? Is it self-control when you avoid eating a food because you don’t notice it, like it or receive a rush of reward from it?\n\nAnyone could resist the food under those circumstances. And even though Nicky doesn’t really need willpower in this situation, if she did need it, it would function quite well because she’s not dieting. On top of everything else, dieting disrupts cognition, especially executive function, which is the process that helps with self-control. So dieters have less willpower right when they need more willpower. And non-dieters have plenty, even though they don’t need any.\n\nAnd of course, even if Nicky were to eat those tempting foods, her metabolism would burn up more of those calories than a dieter’s metabolism.\n\nSo Nicky is mistakenly being given credit for succeeding at a job that is not only easy for her, but easier than the job dieters face.\n\nThe cruel irony is that after someone has been dieting for some time, changes happen that make it hard to succeed at dieting in the long run. It is physically possible, and a small minority of dieters do manage to keep weight off for several years. But not without a demoralizing and all-encompassing battle with their physiology the entire time.\n\nIt’s easy to see why dieters usually regain the weight they lose on their New Year’s resolution diet, and we have the following suggestions for when that happens: If you are a Nicky, remember the self-denial these dieters have subjected themselves to and how little they were eating while you treated yourself to decadent desserts. Be impressed with their efforts, and grateful that you don’t have to attempt it.\n\nIf you are a dieter, remind yourself that you aren’t weak, but that you were in an unfair fight that very few win. Change your focus to improving your health with exercise (which doesn’t require weight loss), and resolve to choose a different New Year’s resolution next year.\n\nTraci Mann is the author of “Secrets from the Eating Lab.” This article was originally published on The Conversation.

          "description": "Billions of passengers took to the skies on commercial flights in 2017, and almost every one of them made it safely to their destination. According to Dutch aviation consultants from To70, 2017 was the safest year on record for commercial aviation worldwide.\n\nTo70 searched through the records of commercial flights worldwide for all aircraft with a takeoff weight of more than 5,700 kilograms (12,566 pounds), which is less than a third of the weight of the smallest Embraer ERJ used in regional operations by US airlines. The group found just 111 accidents in 2017, with only two of those leading to a loss of life:\n\nAn Embraer Brasilia lost control in flight in Angola after reportedly suffering an engine failure.\n\nA Czech-built Let 410 crashed on landing at Nelken in Russia.\n\nThe total loss of life across those two fatal accidents: 13 people.\n\nThis exceptionally low number of fatal accidents calculates to 0.06 fatal accidents per million flights in 2017. Put another way, the chance of a commercial flight being involved in a fatal accident during 2017 was 1 in approximately 17 million.\n\nThat’s not to say that there weren’t some concerning air travel incidents in 2017:\n\nClose calls: In February, actor Harrison Ford almost landed a plane on top of an American Airlines aircraft while landing on a taxiway, and a United flight had to make evasive maneuvers to avoid hitting a small aircraft. But, the most noteworthy near miss was certainly the Air Canada flight that almost landed on top of a line of large aircraft on a San Francisco (SFO) taxiway.\n\nUncontained engine failures: In September, an Air France A380 spectacularly blew an engine over the Atlantic, but the crew was able to land the aircraft safely. Earlier that same month, TPG‘s Emily McNutt was on a Japan Airlines flight that blew an engine.\n\nToo low: In a near crash of an A380, an Emirates superjumbo dropped to just 400 feet off of the ground eight miles downrange of Moscow’s Domodedovo airport (DME). And in a concerning trend, another Emirates A380 dropped below 500 feet during a turn on approach to JFK before pulling up.\n\nExtreme turbulence: An Aeroflot flight left passengers and crew severely injured near Bangkok (BKK), while 10 American Airlines passengers were taken to the hospital after an extreme turbulence event near Philadelphia (PHL). And 11 EVA Air passengers and crew ended up in a Chicago hospital after an incident off of Japan.\n\nAlso, plenty of planes hit objects in the air — if history has held true, 1 in 2,000 flights incurred a bird strike, including this noteworthy birdstrike in Miami. A Virgin Australia flight had the remarkable experience of striking both a bird and a rabbit in the air. And there was whatever damaged the nosecone of the Delta charter flight carrying the Oklahoma City Thunder — a bird strike, strike by another object or a structural failing of the nose cone.\n\nThen there were the on-ground issues. In May, a massive IT outage cancelled over 700 British Airways flights, affecting over 75,000 travelers. During the fall, floods and hurricanes cancelled thousands of flights and even led to the complete evacuation of aircraft from Florida. And just a couple of weeks ago, a power outage in Atlanta crippled flights out of Delta’s key hub.\n\nSo, while air travel wasn’t always smooth during 2017, it was still remarkably safe. For the eighth year in a row, there wasn’t a single death from an accident on a US flagged commercial flight. And one of the worst injuries on a US-based aircraft was dealt by Chicago airport security in response to an overbooked United flight. In the Americas, there were more deaths from jet blast than commercial aviation accidents.\n\nH/T: Independent\n",

          "description": "Even as president, Trump keeps up on how his Washington, DC hotel is doing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s isn’t so separate from his businesses as he would like the public to think. Throughout his campaign and through his first few months as president, Trump has said he would distance himself from his Trump Organization and hand it over to his sons in lieu of divesting entirely, which ethics experts say he should. They fear that otherwise he will use the presidency for his own personal gain or that his policies will be influenced by his business interests.\n\nAs far as the president flagship hotel in Washington, DC goes, Trump is “definitely still involved,” according to an email sent by the hotel’s director of revenue management first reported by the Daily Beast.\n\nOn Friday, that site published a September 12th email from Jeng Chi Hung, the director of revenue management for the Trump International Hotel in Washington. In it he wrote that he met with Trump, who asked specific questions about the hotel and his business. The message says:\n\nThe company is interesting to work for being under the Trump umbrella. DJT is supposed to be out of the business and passed on to his sons, but he's definitely still involved... so it's interesting and unique in that way. I had a brief meeting with him a few weeks ago, and he was asking about banquet revenues and demographics. And, he asked if his presidency hurt the businesses. So, he seems self aware about things, at least more than he lets on. I am far left leaning politically, so working here has been somewhat of a challenge for me. But, it's all business.\n\nIt’s not clear when Hung met with Trump. Mickael Damelincourt, the hotel’s managing director, told the Daily Beast that Hung made Trump’s comments up “in an effort to enhance his sense of importance to a former employer.”\n\nTrump’s refusal to completely separate himself from his vast business holdings has been a source of ethical consternation since his election. Shortly before his inauguration, Trump and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, outlined a vague plan for the president-elect to distance himself from his company at Trump Tower in New York. They announced he would put his businesses in a trust managed by his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\n\n“I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks,” Trump said. “But I would be able to do that if I wanted to.”\n\nEthics experts have argued that Trump should divest — sell off — his assets entirely and put their value into a blind trust, an investment portfolio of which he would have no knowledge or control.\n\n“The president is now entering a world of public service,” Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, the government agency that oversees executive branch policies related to conflict of interest, said in a speech at the Brookings Institution at the start of the year. “He's going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He's going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So no, I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.”\n\nShaub resigned in July to join the Campaign Legal Center, a group that works on campaign finance and ethics in government. “In working with the current administration, it has become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program,” he said in a press release at the time. It’s perhaps telling that Shaub felt he couldn’t reform the government from the inside.\n\nTrump’s Washington Hotel has been especially problematic\n\nSome of Trump’s businesses have struggled since his election — for example, a Trump-branded hotel in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood dropped the Trump name after a number of high-profile clients refused to stay there, and his golf clubs and hotels in more liberal-leaning areas appear to have declined in business and, in some instances, revenue.\n\nBut the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, which Trump opened while campaigning for the presidency, has flourished. According to the Wall Street Journal, the hotel brought in $18 million in revenue in the first four months of 2017, in part by hiking its room rates. It made a nearly $2 million profit during that time period, despite budgeting for a $2.1 million loss.\n\nThe hotel has become a sort of White House extension since the president took office. Foreign dignitaries, lobbyists and Republican lawmakers often visit the hotel in hopes of getting in Trump’s good graces. The Washington Post in May sent reporters to the hotel every day, where they spotted a range of figures and organizations, including former Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski, business groups promoting Turkish-American relations, and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n\n“Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm into a blind trust that had the power to sell it,” Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the bipartisan watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington, recently told Vox. “It wasn’t as though you had foreign powers or lobbyists trying to hang out at the peanut farm to try and influence the president. It didn’t have that kind of mixing of business and the office.”\n\nTo a large extent, Trump’s presidency marks the first time such an ethical conundrum has been seen in the White House; it’s also shown that the rules governing presidential ethics and conflicts of interest are more guidelines or norms than enforceable laws.\n\nCREW sued the president in January, claiming that Trump’s business interests were causing conflicts of interest and violating the US Constitution — specifically, the foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits Trump from receiving anything of value from foreign governments. This month a federal judge dismissed the case, and the flow of foreign dignitaries, lawmakers and Trump allies through the Trump hotel lobby continues unabated.\n\n“Our statement as released from Mickael Damelincourt is accurate and there is nothing more to add,” said Trump International Hotel spokeswoman Patricia Tang in an email. “There is no conflict of interest.”\n",

          "description": "Does any country evoke a sense of mystery as resolutely as Morocco? From the maze of souks in Marrakech to the windswept dunes of the Sahara and everything in between, this diverse North African kingdom rocks the casbah and will spice up your Instagram feed at the same time.\n\nFor those who think some of the sights risk being cliché, well, perhaps you haven’t found the right filter. The most magical thing about this country — other than the fantastic, fragrant food — is its authenticity. You find it everywhere: from master craftsmanship in the souks to exquisite hidden riads to the smile of the guy who’s serving you a sweet mint tea. So, linadhhab (let’s go!); here are 13 ideas for Instagram gold.\n\n1.  The Antique Doorways of Fez\n\nUp until 1912, the city of Fez was the capital of modern Morocco and is considered one of its four imperial cities (along with Rabat, Meknes and Marrakech). Its car-free Fez el Bali medina, a World Heritage Site, is a walled area with atmospheric souks and elaborate carved doorways, reminders of the architectural marvels of the Marinid dynasty which held sway here from the 13th to 15th centuries. The green-tiled roofs are soothing, but at street level, stroll and ‘gram those entryways to your heart’s content.\n\nA post shared by Elsa Esmeraldo (@dirty_stop_over) on Sep 27, 2017 at 3:57pm PDT\n\n2. Jemaa el-Fnaa Market\n\nIn an early episode of Absolutely Fabulous, Edina asks Patsy why her daughter Saffy can’t go to Morocco on her own since they are separately “going to Marrakech.” Saffy points out to her space-cadet elders that Marrakech is in Morocco, but the point is taken: For many travelers, Marrakech is synonymous with Morocco. It’s both enigmatic and iconic, nowhere more so than in the vast Jemaa el-Fnaa market square located inside the walled medina. This is where you’ll find everything from acrobats to astrologers to fire-eaters and bellydancers, but most famously a wealth of shopping opportunities.\n\nA post shared by Anna – Luxury Travel&Lifestyle (@jetset_anna) on Dec 9, 2017 at 8:00pm PST\n\n3. Koutoubia Mosque\n\nThe minaret of this landmark mosque, completed in 1199 by the Berber ruler Almohad Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur, has been featured on many an iconic vintage travel poster. It rises 253 feet above the southwest section of the city’s walled medina. The elegant structure features decorative arches, pointed merlons and lovely ceramic inlays, which influenced the design of the Giralda belltower of the Seville Cathedral.\n\nA post shared by Moe (@sanmoetrip) on Dec 10, 2017 at 1:34pm PST\n\n4. Chefchaouen\n\nIf you like blue, this town in northwestern Morocco, set inland from Tangier in the Rif Mountains, is the place for you and your Instagram account. From its houses, walls and alleyways to pretty much every manmade structure in=between, it’s all blue, all the time. Savor the panorama of the medina’s bright blue hues from the top of the casbah tower, or stick to ground level and the winding lanes where you’re likely to find a cat or two on an innocent quest for some love on the ‘gram.\n\nA post shared by Best City Breaks (@bestcitybreaks) on Dec 9, 2017 at 2:43am PST\n\n5. Your Own Semi-Private Riad\n\nWith its vast Atlantic and Mediterranean littorals and arid but oasis-studded interior, Morocco never fails to stun. In terms of urban oases, it’s all about the riads: traditional Moroccan townhouses or palaces with interior courtyards. This is where tranquility to the tune of elaborate tiling, lush gardens and fountains await. Chances are if you stay in a boutique-style hotel in Marrakech or Fez you’ll be able to luxuriate in a real riad — which you may want to keep to yourself (but not before you ‘gram it).\n\nA post shared by Sarah Owen (@sarahsarahowen) on Oct 7, 2017 at 2:11am PDT\n\n6. Ben Youssef Madrasa\n\nThis iconic former madrasa, or Islamic college, in Marrakech is one of Morocco’s architectural treasures. Founded in the 14th century by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hassan, historically it is the country’s largest madrasa. With its stunning mix of girih geometric patterns, elaborately carved wooden doors and zellige tile work, the place seems like it was made for quite contemplation — and in latter days, for Instagram.\n\nA post shared by Paola Gambuzza (@paolagambu) on Dec 8, 2017 at 12:05am PST\n\n7. El Jadida\n\nSituated on Morocco’s Atlantic coast south of Casablanca, El Jadida was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on account of the huge stone ramparts built by the Portuguese in the 16th century. These thick walls frame the star-shaped Fortress of Mazagan (the Portuguese name for El Jadida). While jumping off the 26-foot-high walls into the water below (on the seaside flank) may be inadvisable, it can be fun to observe some of the more adventurous locals doing just that. Another cinematic site is the old Portuguese cistern: its eerie rows of underground stone pillars made an appearance in Orson Welles’ film version of Othello and are sure add a shot of haunting beauty to your feed.\n\nA post shared by Sharlyne (@sharlyne_andrea) on Dec 1, 2017 at 4:54am PST\n\n8. Merzouga Dunes\n\nLocated far inland near the Algerian border, Merzouga is a main point of entry to the swath of Sahara sand dunes known as Erg Chebbi. The lofty, wind-swept dunes here and at close-by Hassi Labied form the backdrop and focal point for organized camel rides and other desert adventures. As such it’s the gateway to many highly Instagrammable moments: but no complaints about the dust, please!\n\nA post shared by Fadhu Mariam (@raajethere) on Oct 6, 2017 at 1:26am PDT\n\n9. Ouarzazate\n\nEast of Marrakech and south of the Atlas Mountains, Ouarzazate is home to the impressive Taourirt Kasbah and both the town and epic desert landscape to the south have long been favored as film locations. Scenes of everything from Lawrence of Arabia to Game of Thrones have been filmed in and around Ouarzazate, whose name comes from a Berber phrase meaning “no noise.” No worry though: The town’s mighty walls and ochre tones will slay the ‘gram in silence.\n\nA post shared by Eran Abulafia (@eran.about) on Dec 5, 2017 at 2:12pm PST\n\nA post shared by Eran Abulafia (@eran.about) on Dec 5, 2017 at 2:12pm PS\n\n10. Aït-Benhaddou\n\nThis ksar (fortified village) along a onetime caravan route near the southern slopes of the High Atlas mountains is a beautiful pre-Saharan habitat whose densely arranged dwellings, fashioned from clay brick, are always ready for their close-up. These earthen casbahs are protected by a ring of defensive walls and evocative corner towers. No wonder, then, that it’s another popular film location, with everything from Time Bandits to Babel to Gladiator having shot  sequences here.\n\nA post shared by Rie.Hotaru (@rie_0209) on Dec 10, 2017 at 2:46am PST\n\n11. Tangier\n\nWhile it may be lacking in iconic sights and doesn’t have the same mystique as Morocco’s imperial cities, Tangier (or Tangiers) is exotic all the same. From Berber origins to Phoenician trading post to Roman city to the present day, it’s a historic melting pot of cultures, and with its location at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar makes for great Insta opps in any season.\n\nA post shared by Alia Chergui (@aliachergui) on Dec 10, 2017 at 1:29am PST\n\n12. Asilah\n\nBreezy and easygoing, Asilah is situated less than 20 miles south of Tangier on Morocco’s Atlantic coast. A town with Phoenician roots, its centuries-old seaside ramparts were built by the Portuguese and there is Spanish heritage as well.  The twisting lanes and mainly white buildings of the medina, many with ornate mashrabiya projecting windows, will you have you thinking of Mykonos with a très cool North African twist — and it all makes for Instagram gold.\n\nA post shared by Freya  (@freyaleif) on Dec 8, 2017 at 9:30am PST\n\n13. Ouzoud Falls\n\nWhen you think of Morocco the desert is probably what first comes to mind, so coming across the delightful Ouzoud falls is doubly refreshing. They’re located near a village in the Middle Atlas Mountains called Tanaghmeilt. The 360-foot-tall cataract makes for a popular day trip from Marrakech, which is about 90 miles southwest. And before you stow your ‘gram cam look out, because there are monkeys vying for your attention here, too.\n\nA post shared by D A V I D (@drtango) on Dec 8, 2017 at 10:51pm PST\n\nFeatured photo of one of the most colorful alleyways in the city of Chefchaouen, Morocco by Jeremy Villasis / Getty Images\n",

          "description": "Most people who use Google Maps do so without much attention to detail. We just need the directions, the right subway route, or the name of that good sushi place. We don’t spend too much time pondering how Google got so good at mapping the world, and what decisions and choices were made along the way that have made it the go-to navigational tool of our time. \n\nJustin O’Beirne pays attention to these types of details. He’s a cartographer who helped contribute to Apple Maps. So we should trust him when he explains — in depth — about what makes Google Maps so superior to any other mapping service. \n\nwhat makes Google Maps so superior\n\nThis week, he published a fascinating essay that explains the concept of the “Google Maps’ Moat.” By this, he means the layers of data surrounding Google Maps that basically makes it basically impossible for Apple or any competitor to ever catch up. “Google has gathered so much data, in so many areas, that it’s now crunching it together and creating features that Apple can’t make — surrounding Google Maps with a moat of time,” he writes. “It makes you wonder how long back Google was planning all of this—and what it’s planning next...”\n\nO’Beirne starts out by marveling at the level of detail available in Google Maps for even extremely small towns, such as the one where he grew up in rural Illinois. He highlights how Google, unlike Apple, is able to display the shapes of individual buildings and even smaller structures like tool sheds and mobile homes. These minute details can be found even in towns with populations in the double-digits. He uses this to lament the corresponding lack of detail in Apple Maps. \n\nHe charts the history of Google’s efforts to add buildings large and small, highlighting the search giant’s announcement from 2012 that they were “algorithmically created by taking aerial imagery and using computer vision techniques to render the building shapes.” So in addition to getting a first-person street view of your route, you can zoom outward to seeing a computer-rendered model of the surrounding area for contextual information such as the shapes and sizes of buildings.\n\n“How long until Google has every structure on Earth?”\n\nHe concludes that aerial imagery from satellites has outpaced Google’s famous Street View vehicles in the amount of data used to create these vivid tableaus. And he asks an important question: “[H]ow long until Google has every structure on Earth?”\n\nThen things get interesting. O’Beirne introduces us to two researchers, Rachelle Annechino and Yo-Shang Cheng, who observed that people often describe the layout of their city as it relates to “main drags” or “commercial corridors.” He then goes on to describe Google’s unique approach to highlighting these “Areas of Interest” (AOI). About a year ago, these “main drags” began showing up in Google Maps as clusters of orange buildings. Google communicates these “Areas of Interest” to its users through a specific orange shading, but with a level of detail that is truly stunning. \n\nO’Beirne writes (emphasis his):\n\nThis suggests that Google took its buildings and crunched them against its places. In other words, Google appears to be creating these orange buildings by matching its building and place datasets together[.]\n\n[...]\n\nSo Google seems to be creating AOIs out of its building and place data. But what’s most interesting is that Google’s building and place data are themselves extracted from other Google Maps features.\n\n[...]\n\nIn other words, Google’s buildings are byproducts of its Satellite/Aerial imagery. And some of Google’s places are byproducts of its Street View imagery...so this makes AOIs a byproduct of byproducts. \n\nThis is bonkers, isn’t it? Google is creating data out of data.\n\nThis leads O’Beirne to draw some pretty interesting conclusions. If Google has mapped all the buildings and knows precisely what businesses and points of interest are located within, then perhaps the search giant can install augmented reality windshields in its self-driving cars that tell you everything you need to know about adjacent structures. As you’re driving through a city — or being driven, rather — Google Maps can use its accumulated data to pinpoint buildings where you have an upcoming appointment, for example. \n\nAnother possibility is a ride-hailing service more accurate than Uber. An essay by The Verge’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel makes a cameo in O’Beirne’s story to highlight the difficulty faced by ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft in pinpointing exact pickup and drop-off locations. Uber and Lyft drivers already use Google Maps and Google-owned Waze in such high volumes that both ride-hail services threw up their hands and integrated Google’s exceptional navigation tools into their own apps. \n\nO’Beirne fails to mention Google’s own ride-hail ambitions. Waymo, the self-driving division of Google parent Alphabet, is developing its own ride-hail app in anticipation of launching a commercial self-driving mobility service next year. And Waze has been piloting a car-pooling service in California for the past year. \n\nIt’s clear that Google has its sights set on the lucrative ride-hailing market. And with a powerful tool like Google Maps in its arsenal, it could have its leg up over its more established players. \n",

Names have been changed to protect her subjects’ anonymity.\n\nLinda, late 30s\n\nI met my husband when I was 26 years old; we dated for a year before moving in together, and then we got married at 30. I was so thrilled on our wedding day—it felt like the beginning of a new life for us. We had plans to travel and buy a home, and we agreed that we both wanted children down the road. But…we still felt so young; we were in no rush.\n\nAfter we’d been married for about a year, I started to notice that all of my friends were having babies. I’d been completely oblivious to the “timelines” and the “ticking biological clocks” that women supposedly feel once they’re in their thirties. I decided that I wasn’t really “ready” to be a mom, mostly because I didn’t have that “feeling” that women so often describe. I didn’t think that childbearing was magical: I was afraid what it would do to my body. I was afraid of breastfeeding; I was afraid of dropping the baby; I was afraid I wouldn’t rise to the challenge of motherhood.\n\nBut I think, most of all, I was afraid of what a baby would do to our marriage. My husband and I were always so in love; we were best friends. We shared common interests and hobbies. We loved hiking and being outdoors—how would a baby fit into that? Would I become consumed, forced to leave us on the back-burner? Would we become one of those couples who stayed together for the sake of the children—who went out for a rare date night and spent the hour eating in silence?\n\nI feel like this is typical of men: because I wasn’t leading the charge on wanting to get pregnant, my husband stayed happily mum. Two more years passed before our families got involved and people started asking questions—why aren’t you trying to get pregnant? When can we expect a grandchild? Soon you’ll be too old to have kids—your body will not bounce back as easily as it once could have. And I’d love to say that we were focusing on our careers, or that we had a plan, or that we had just changed our minds and didn’t want children. But that wasn’t the truth: the truth is that we were just failing to start. Neither of us felt strongly enough to actually try. We just got complacent. We were afraid of change.\n\nWe bought a home. We settled into careers. We neared our mid-thirties. And we ran out of excuses.\n\nSo we started trying to conceive. “One and done,” my husband boasted that first time. But I got my period, and his enthusiasm dissipated. The second time around, I started paying more attention to my body. I downloaded an application and tracked my cycle. Again, no baby. But that was fine: I’d read that it takes the average couple about six months to conceive. Because I was already in my mid-thirties, if we weren’t pregnant by six months, I’d have to go in to check that I wasn’t having fertility issues.\n\nBy month four, I had everything down to a science. I had ovulation kits and basal body thermometers, and I’d taught myself how to read my cervical mucus. My husband complained that I was taking the romance out of baby making but I didn’t really listen: it was so unlike me to not be good at something, especially something that was supposed to be as “natural” and easy as having a baby.\n\nMonth four turned out to be my month. I ran through my cache of pregnancy tests and got one positive after another. We celebrated but decided to keep the news to ourselves since miscarriages are common before 12 weeks. And it’s a good thing that we did, because about eight weeks into the pregnancy, I miscarried.\n\nAnd then I miscarried again. And again. And again. Five times over the next two years. I felt exhausted and beaten. My body felt a mess. My hormones had the run of the place, and our marriage started to fall apart. It wasn’t so much the repeated losses—although those were difficult—but the fact that I became totally consumed with just getting pregnant. It became the one thing I couldn’t do, and naturally, the only thing I ever wanted. I’d get my hopes up every single time; he didn’t. I think that to protect himself, he became detached. Every time I failed, I felt crushed. And he felt a little farther away.\n\nHe moved out of the house. We chose not to get a divorce. We went to therapy. We were cordial. Everything was very mature—we just weren’t in love anymore. And then he told me that he met someone. And then he got her pregnant. And then…she was born. And she is beautiful.\n\nFor a very long time, I felt that I would never be happy again. But life goes on, with or without you. I took our savings and went to a fertility specialist. I picked a donor, got inseminated, and then I held my breath for eight weeks. And then for twelve. And then for sixteen. When she was born, I finally breathed again. And she is beautiful, too.\n\nRead more Craigslist Confessionals here. To share your story with Helena, email her at craigslistconfessionalqz@gmail.com. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

And I like things to be colorful,” he says. “And I like to express myself in a colorful way.” \n\nWhile some might call it a homemade theme park, others consider it a junkyard. Either way, walking along the meandering concrete trails here is an experience unlike any other.\n\nKenny, who converted to Islam about 15 years ago (as a Muslim, he says he doesn’t celebrate Christmas), shows me around the grounds wearing sandals, a light-brown shalwar kameez and sporting a scraggly beard that nearly goes down to his bellybutton.\n\nHe shows me a recent sculpture, a tower of bolted together detritus, that looks both like a robot and the set design from a Mad Max film: “Here I’ve got a hedge trimmer, weed-wacker, vacuum cleaner, power tools that went bad. Just about everything but the kitchen sink. But, well, yeah, there’s a kitchen sink right there.” Sure enough, there’s a kitchen sink, affixed to the robot like a distended chest plate.\n\nSeveral of the giant figures are over 20 feet high. Some are mechanized and spin wildly, while others are festooned with colorful blinking lights.  Everything is made of materials, mostly plastic and metal, that others have thrown away.\n\n“I’m basically like a one-man recycling center,” he says.\n\nIrwin started Robolights when he was 12. He asked his father, a local hotelier, if he could put some lights up in the yard. His father said yes, and young Kenny, who was already making sculptures and paintings that filled every nook of the house, transformed the entire backyard from something that looked like a David Hockney painting that morphed into a work by Salvador Dali.\n\nOver the past three decades, Irwin has built Robolights into an international destination. More than 40,000 people visited last year during the six weeks he keeps the installation open to the public. There is no admission fee, although he does accept donations.\n\nHis father died in 2016, and Kenny has committed himself to keeping Robolights going. He says it was his father’s wish that the installation remain a part of the neighborhood’s holiday ethos.\n\n“He loved it,” says Kenny. “He used to say, ‘Instead of cursing the darkness, light it up one light at a time.'”\n\nThe installation is both impressive and beautiful, but one question lingers over the whole enterprise: why?\n\n“Well, basically, when people say, ‘Why?’ Well, I say, ‘Well, why not?'”\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Between pro-slavery comments and birtherism, Moore made Jones’s victory with black voters easy.\n\nA Democrat will be the newest senator for one of the reddest states in the country.\n\nA key explanation for the shocking upset on Tuesday night in Alabama’s special election: Black voters turned out — and strongly backed Democrat Doug Jones over Republican Roy Moore.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the results by race, based on preliminary exit polls:\n\nDoug Jones has won Alabama. Preliminary exit polls from @PostPolls point to black voters as the force behind the upset victory. https://t.co/q9ucxlS0er http://pic.twitter.com/HXC3OsYa0u\n\n— Post Graphics (@PostGraphics) December 13, 2017\n\nThere is also data that suggests Jones simply got much more of his base out to the polls than Moore did. Jones got about 92 percent of the raw vote total that Hillary Clinton did in 2016 in Alabama’s general election, while Moore got about 49 percent of the raw vote total that Donald Trump did in the state.\n\nAnd this happened despite concerns about voter suppression efforts due to Alabama’s strict voter ID law and voting restrictions for people with felony records, both of which disproportionately impact black voters.\n\nIt’s too early to say decisively how Jones pulled this off over Moore. For example, did depressed white turnout play the defining role, or was it increased black turnout? Exit polls are simply not reliable enough to make these kinds of sweeping judgments. With more and better data, statisticians and researchers will wonk this out over the next few days, weeks, and months.\n\nBut one thing we do know for certain is that unique aspects of Jones and Moore as candidates, as well as the national political climate, made an outcome in which Jones triumphs with black voters fairly likely all along.\n\nMoore’s slavery-friendly remarks resurfaced in the last few days\n\nBlack voters have, in general, heavily favored Democrats for decades now. But Moore was also a uniquely bad candidate for black voters.\n\nFor one, Moore was mired by bizarre comments over the last few days of the campaign in which he seemed to endorse or at least tolerate slavery.\n\nFirst, comments resurfaced in which Moore appeared to say that the US should be more like it was during slavery. Asked by a black man at a September campaign rally what Trump means when he says “make America great again,” Moore at first acknowledged the US’s history of racial tensions. Then he said, “I think it was great at the time when families were united — even though we had slavery. They cared for one another. People were strong in the families. Our families were strong. Our country had a direction.” He later added that he was focused on culture, not policy, in his remarks.\n\nThen Andrew Kaczynski at CNN uncovered 2011 remarks in which Moore responded positively to a radio host’s comment that all constitutional amendments after the 10th should be abolished. Moore said, “That would eliminate many problems. You know, people don’t understand how some of these amendments have completely tried to wreck the form of government that our forefathers intended.”\n\nAmong those amendments: the 13th abolished slavery, the 14th guarantees equal protection under the law (and was central to US Supreme Court cases that supported racial integration in public education and ended states’ bans on interracial marriage), the 15th protects black voting rights, and the 19th gave women the right to vote.\n\nSo you had two newly resurfaced comments that could be interpreted, at least in part, as fondly recalling the days of slavery.\n\nMoore’s campaign of course strenuously denied this, telling me at one point that such an interpretation of his comments was “recklessly malicious.”\n\nBut when your candidate’s comments can be interpreted as anything remotely close to pro-slavery or slavery-tolerant, you have a big problem on your hands.\n\nThat’s especially true since Moore already had a history of racially insensitive and bigoted remarks, previously invoking the racist birther conspiracy theory by questioning if President Barack Obama was born in the US and comparing the US Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage to the 1857 decision that effectively denied black people citizenship.\n\nIn contrast, Jones had made a name for himself in the early 2000s by successfully prosecuting two Ku Klux Klan members for the 1963 bombing of the predominantly black 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which was one of the most high-profile white supremacist crimes — not just in Alabama, but nationally — of the era.\n\nCombined, this gave black voters a very clear choice: On one hand, you have a guy who seems okay with slavery. On the other hand, you have a guy who prosecuted the KKK.\n\nThe national political climate probably helped Jones too\n\nThe broader context here matters as well. While the Senate campaign went on, we were in the middle of a national political climate that has taken a frighteningly racist turn.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself has a long history of racist remarks. He launched his modern political career by promoting the racist birther conspiracy theory — an idea that he is still reportedly promoting in private. As a candidate for president, Trump also made all sorts of racist comments — suggesting that Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists, proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the US, saying a US judge should recuse himself from a case simply because of his Mexican heritage, and deploying dog whistles about “law and order.”\n\nHis administration has also pursued policies that will disproportionately hurt minority groups, including his travel ban, immigration restrictions, “tough on crime” policies, and potential voting restrictions.\n\nAll of this boiled over in August, when white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and KKK members descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the city taking down Confederate statutes. The protests quickly turned violent as the white supremacists faced off with counterprotesters who showed up to demonstrate against racism. That day, a Nazi sympathizer rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters — injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nTrump’s response to all of this? He blamed both sides. “I think there is blame … on both sides,” he told reporters days after the protests. “I have no doubt about it. You don’t have a doubt about it either. If you reported it accurately, you would say that.”\n\nAs the head of the Republican Party, Trump was morally equivocating between literal white supremacists and anti-racism protesters.\n\nThis is the broader context in which Jones won and Moore lost. On top of Jones’s and Moore’s own unique qualities, the Republican Party as a whole has, due to Trump, been tied to outright racism. It is no wonder black voters would turn out against Moore and for Jones in this political climate.\n\nCouple that motivation for higher black turnout with the allegations against Moore that he sexually abused teenagers, which almost certainly depressed turnout among Republicans in Alabama while pushing Democrats to get out to vote.\n\nThat’s how you get a situation in which the newest of two senators representing one of the most conservative states in the country will be a Democrat.\n",

          "description": "So it begins. The Federal Communications Commission voted on Dec. 14 to repeal the net neutrality rules that prevent US telecoms from blocking, slowing, or charging more for certain content. Those protections are gone. What’s left is an assurance that the Federal Trade Commission will enforce the voluntary commitments made by telecommunications firms like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon.\n\nTechnically, the companies have pledged to uphold “net neutrality” commitments under the new regulatory regime. Yet the nature of those commitments are changing. Comcast’s website has changed dramatically since at least April, when the chairman of the FCC announced his intention to repeal net neutrality. Previous versions of the site, preserved by the Internet Archive, promised to not throttle content, prioritize internet traffic, or create paid fast lanes, while committing to making internet accessible to low income families.\n\nBut the website had already pared back its lofty language by November, as Ars Technica spotted at the time. The changes seem all the more glaring today.  \n\nComcast now has three lines committing to “not block, slow down or discriminate against lawful content” while stating it “believes in full transparency in our customer policies.” That leaves a lot of wriggle room. It could be that Comcast will follow through on some of its earlier promises or, as the new language suggests, it will start implementing paid prioritization (arguing that it is not discrimination). The company has been changing its language about this for months. A Comcast spokesperson told CNET in November it has “no plans” to enter paid prioritization agreements.\n\nMost Popular\n\n\t\tRead full story\n",

          "description": "As you all know, I’m fond of financial scorecards. While admitting their limitations, I like numbers and tools that allow you to compare your financial progress with other people.\n\nI like credit scores, for instance, because they put a number on how you handle money — a number you can compare to Americans at large. And I like apps like Credit Sesame, which let you to monitor your credit score — much like a bathroom scale lets you monitor your weight.\n\nPerhaps my favorite number is net worth, the total value of everything you own. Calculating net worth is easy. It’s what you own minus what you owe. That’s it. Simple, right? Simple but powerful.\n\nNet worth tracks your financial health in the same way that weight measures your fitness. Neither number tells the whole story, but as a measure of change over time each is a handy tool.\n\nWant to calculate your own net worth? I’ve created this free net worth spreadsheet in Google Docs for you to download or copy. It’s still branded with Money Boss, but I’ll change that soon.\n\nNet worth is a great way to track your own financial progress as you age. But have you ever wished you could compare your net worth with the net worth of other Americans? I have. It’s possible, but it’s a complicated process that required digging through tables of government data.\n\nWell, Zach at Four Pillar Freedom — who must have too much free time — recently took info from the Federal Reserve’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances and created a couple of tools that let you visualize the net worth of Americans by age. These tools aren’t sophisticated. They perform simple tasks, but they perform them well.\n\nHere, for instance, is Zach’s tool for looking at net worth percentiles by age.\n\nMy net worth of approximately $1.6 million puts me between the 95th and 96th percentile of Americans aged 45-49.\n\nZach also whipped up a quick chart to show the number of people who have positive net worths versus those with negative net worths. Plus he has a quick tool that compares the median net worth for each age group to the net worth of the top 1% in each population.\n\nIf you too are a money nerd who likes to compare yourself to others, then take a few minutes to explore Zach’s net worth visualizer!\n\nThe post Visualizing your net worth — and how it compares to others appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",

          "description": "President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last week made little sense to most Middle East experts. His own national security team opposed the decision. But for many white evangelical Christians, 81 percent of whom voted for Trump, it was great news.\n\nAccording to a recent poll released by the Brookings Institution, 53 percent of American evangelicals supported Trump’s decision, while only 40 percent opposed it.  (Sixty-three percent of all Americans opposed the decision.)\n\nTo understand why evangelicals are so enthusiastic about this move, I reached out to Elizabeth Oldmixon, a politics professor at the University of North Texas. Oldmixon studies the rather strange alliance between evangelical Christians and people in the orthodox Jewish community who are stridently pro-Israel. \n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nSean Illing\n\nI don’t fully understand why evangelical Christians are so supportive of Israel. Can you walk me through it?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nFirst, we should remember that “evangelical” is a really broad term. In a most general sense, evangelicals are people who believe in the absolute authority of the Bible, in salvation through Jesus, and in the need to spread the gospel. People who identify as evangelicals internalize those three things to different levels, and so in the same way we talk about cultural Catholics, we can also talk about cultural evangelicals. \n\nSo I would really focus here on a subset of the evangelical community for whom the status of Israel is really, really important because of the way they understand the end of time. \n\nSean Illing\n\nAnd how large is that subset?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nRoughly a third of the American evangelical population, which is something like 15 million people. \n\nSean Illing\n\nWhy are these evangelicals so interested in the fate of Israel?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nThese are the folks who believe that there will be a millennium in the future, a golden age, where Christ reigns on Earth, [and] they believe that before Christ will return, there will be a tribulation where Christ defeats evil. There will be natural disasters and wars, and perhaps an Antichrist, as the book of Revelations notes. Then at the end of that period, the people of the Mosaic covenant, including the Jews, will convert. Then after their conversion, the great millennium starts.\n\nSean Illing\n\nAnd what about the people who don’t convert? What becomes of them?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nWell, according to the evangelicals who believe this, they’ll end up with the rest of the unsaved, which means they’ll be wiped out and sent to hell. \n\nSean Illing\n\nSo politics is a means to what they see as a religious goal?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nYes. This is a movement in Christianity that’s as old as Christianity itself. You have this group of people looking around for signs of the end time, and in the 20th century when Israel was founded, this was seen as a major sign. This was electrifying for that community because the gathering of all the Jews in exile to the Holy Land is a prerequisite for all of these events unfolding. So for the subset of evangelicals in the 20th century, support for Israel became a really, really important political position. \n\n        A Palestinian holds a portrait of Donald Trump during protest on December 9, 2017, in Jerusalem.\n\n        Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images\n\nSean Illing\n\nWhy is Jerusalem in particular so crucial?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nWell, the whole area is important. The tenet of Christian Zionism is that God's promise of the Holy Land to the Jews is eternal. It's not just something in antiquity. When we talk about the Holy Land, God's promise of the Holy Land, we're talking about real estate on both sides of the Jordan River. So the sense of a greater Israel and expansionism is really important to this community. Jerusalem is just central to that. It's viewed as a historical and biblical capital.\n\nSean Illing\n\nHow do people on the Israel side justify their alliance with fundamentalist Christians? After all, the Christian prophecy implies the destruction of Jews who don’t convert.\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nThere's something that these Christians have in common with religious Zionists in Israel. The founding generation in Israel was fairly secular. Their support for a Jewish state wasn't about biblical prophecy. It was about physical security. David Ben-Gurion [the first prime minister of Israel] came up with an accommodation for the religious community so they would support the formation of Israel and the establishment of Israel, but his motivations weren't religious per se. \n\nBut religious Jews were always unhappy that the founding generation wasn't really motivated by a religious understanding of the Jewish people in the world. That's something that evangelicals in this country share. They support Israel for religious reasons, not secular reasons. \n\nSean Illing\n\nBut orthodox Jews don’t share the evangelical conception of hell, which includes literal lakes of fire, right?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon \n\nNo. Jewish people have their own theology of the end times. There is an understanding that the Messiah will come, but it won't be a second coming of the sort Christians believe in. But the state of Israel has welcomed the political support of evangelical Christians nevertheless. They even encourage Christians to visit Israel, to tour the holy sites.\n\nSean Illing\n\nSo this is an alliance based on political expedience?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nI think that’s basically right. \n\n        President Donald Trump and pastor Robert Jeffress participate in the Celebrate Freedom Rally at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on July 1, 2017, in Washington, DC.\n\n        Olivier Douliery-Pool via Getty Images\n\nSean Illing\n\nHow do Arab and Israeli Christians feel about all this?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nI'm less sure about that. We’re talking about a relatively small community here. I haven't seen poll data, and I haven't studied Arab Christians who are Israeli citizens to a great degree, but they tend not to be of the evangelical variety. End times prophecies aren’t especially important to them. \n\nSean Illing\n\nDo you think this political gamble will pay off for Trump?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nI think it depends, first, on how long this process takes. It could just fade away to the background. Second, and this is really key, it depends upon whether or not the administration down the road is willing to say, \"Okay, East Jerusalem can be controlled by Palestinian Arabs, and West Jerusalem will be controlled by Israel.\" If the administration plans for a united Jerusalem under the sovereignty of Israel, that will be pretty problematic for the peace process. So it depends upon whether they'll concede to divided control.\n\nSean Illing\n\nAnd do you think this move made political sense for Trump at home?\n\nElizabeth Oldmixon\n\nYes, I do. I’m not sure it's good for the Republican Party in the long run, but I do think it maintains the support of high-profile evangelical leaders, such as Jerry Falwell Jr. and Robert Jeffress. That will be key as the president's support drops among other groups. In other words, this contributes to a floor below which Trump’s support cannot drop. \n",

          "description": "This weekend, when the New York Times ran a profile (paywall) about the daily life of Donald Trump, we learned that the US president drinks not one or two, but 12—or more!—cans of Diet Coke a day.\n\nJournalists, social media users, and citizens of the world at large are in a tizzy. Should anyone be surprised, though, given we already knew Trump simply presses a button on his desk in the Oval Office when in in need of a soda and gets one delivered posthaste?\n\n“Nobody drinks that much Diet Coke in one fucking day. He might be a serial killer,” wrote one Twitter user, the declaration garnering more than a thousand retweets. Others rebuked the president for indulging in junk food, over-caffeinating, or seeming to lack any interest in self-preservation.\n\nThose are valid criticisms, and there are a few minor downsides to drinking 12 cans of Diet Coke a day. But consider the myriad of benefits. Diet Coke is sweet, but not sugary, and contains zero calories. Yet it’s formulated in such a way to stimulate taste buds the same way that drinks full of actual sugar do, making it a decent substitute for people trying to stave off diabetes or cut weight while accustomed to a traditional high-carb Western diet. And a regular-size single can of Diet Coke contains about 40 mg of caffeine—less than half the amount of a cup of black coffee.\n\nThen there are its merits in filling an existential void. “Cracking open a can of it, or pouring some over ice, helps me survive a long work day,” one impassioned journalist wrote in NPR in 2012, responding to a wave of criticisms against Diet Coke launched by health and wellness magazines. The Outline earlier this year published an in-depth takedown of anti-Diet Coke claims, calling it a “magical, calorie-free elixir.”\n\nIn other words, as far as vices go, this one is relatively harm-free. All the more power if you can get it delivered—in a wine glass—by glove-clad servers waiting quietly behind you as you address the prime minster of Japan, as is the case in this set of infamous photographs taken earlier this year.\n\nCoca-Cola has been struggling to sell Diet Coke in recent years, as the world’s preferences shift to foods and drinks that are marketed as “natural” or “organic”—but good on Trump for doing his part to keep this particular American habit— and industry—alive.\n",

          "description": "The end-game for Google’s AI subsidiary DeepMind was never beating people at board games. It’s always been about creating something akin to a combustion engine for intelligence — a generic thinking machine that can be applied to a broad range of challenges. The company is still a long way off achieving this goal, but new research published by its scientists this week suggests they’re at least headed down the right path. \n\nIn the paper, DeepMind describes how a descendant of the AI program that first conquered the board game Go has taught itself to play a number of other games at a superhuman level. After eight hours of self-play, the program bested the AI that first beat the human world Go champion; and after four hours of training, it beat the current world champion chess-playing program, Stockfish. Then for a victory lap, it trained for just two hours and polished off one of the world’s best shogi-playing programs named Elmo (shogi being a Japanese version of chess that’s played on a bigger board).\n\nFor each game, the AI program taught itself how to play\n\nOne of the key advances here is that the new AI program, named AlphaZero, wasn’t specifically designed to play any of these games. In each case, it was given some basic rules (like how knights move in chess, and so on) but was programmed with no other strategies or tactics. It simply got better by playing itself over and over again at an accelerated pace — a method of training AI known as “reinforcement learning.” \n\nUsing reinforcement learning in this way isn’t new in and of itself. DeepMind’s engineers used the same method to create AlphaGo Zero; the AI program that was unveiled this October. But, as this week’s paper describes, the new AlphaZero is a “more generic version” of the same software, meaning it can be applied to a broader range of tasks without being primed beforehand. \n\nWhat’s remarkable here is that in less than 24 hours, the same computer program was able to teach itself how to play three complex board games at superhuman levels. That’s a new feat for the world of AI.\n\nThis takes DeepMind just that little bit closer to building the generic thinking machine the company dreams of, but major challenges lie ahead. When DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis showed off AlphaGo Zero earlier this year, he suggested that a future version of the program could help with a range of scientific problems — from designing new drugs to discovering new materials. But these problems are qualitatively very different to just playing board games, and a whole lot of work needs to be done to find out how exactly algorithms can tackle them. All we can say for certain now, is that artificial intelligence has definitely moved on from just playing chess. \n",

          "description": "Cairo\n\nIt was the lunches in his office in Lebanon’s capital Beirut that first got Waleed Abd El Rahman thinking about the food business. As a busy professional, the Egyptian entrepreneur had the selection of eating greasy fast food or overpriced but healthy meals from nearby restaurants. Another option was to order a home-cooked meal from a local trader, which was nutritious but wasn’t regularly available or arrived on time.\n\nWaleed reckoned that most of these women traders made decent returns only when they cooked for big company events or during religious celebrations like Ramadan and Eid. Like the cooks in his home country, they weren’t also well-connected to their customers, many of whom were professionals like him in search of healthier choices. If this was done successfully, he thought, it would allow the women to scale up their business, do something they are passionate about regularly, and achieve financial freedom.\n\nAnd so in Oct. 2015, Waleed quit his job as the managing director of the MIT Technology Review Arab Edition and moved back to Cairo to start Mumm, an on-demand, home-cooked food service. The platform, which enlists both Egyptian and Syrian refugee cooks, trains them on food safety and quality, markets their specialty dishes, and ultimately helps deliver a fresh hot meal to customers in between 60-90 minutes.\n\n“The whole business and show is about and around them,” Waleed says. “It’s about empowering them further with self-actualization.”\n\nThat audacious sense of achievement is something that pervades Egyptian startups as they gain a prominent profile in Africa’s tech landscape. Despite a government crackdown on civil liberties and independent websites, a militant insurgency in parts of the country, deadly terrorist attacks, and a dramatic fall in tourism, Egypt’s nascent tech scene remains a bright spot for the country. And after years of being scared off by political turmoil, investors are making a comeback with fundraising for Egyptian startups jumping 105% in 2016 alone.\n\n “One of the biggest wins for the revolution is that it made a lot of people believe in themselves.” The availability of a large market of almost 100 million people, a young and tech-savvy populace, rising internet penetration, and the ubiquity of inefficiencies in the public sector have coalesced to boost this technological transformation. It has also enabled an environment where many can access employment opportunities in the digital sector, influence or alter social and family dynamics and build better futures.\n\nSince the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, homegrown companies in Egypt have been created to detect and report bugs (Instabug), navigate traffic (Bey2ollak), compare online shopping prices (Yaoota), digitize death and obituary services (ElWafeyat) and provide free crowdsourced online video education (Nafham).\n\nSome of these companies, like online recruitment platform Wuzzuf and Instabug, have even been fully absorbed by Silicon Valley accelerators, establishing offices in San Francisco.\n\nThis boom, some say, is symptomatic and directly linked to the popular and largely nonviolent demonstrations that rocked the country in 2011 and forced out the dictator Hosni Mubarak who ruled the country for over three decades. While a significant amount of groundwork was done in the years prior, the civil resistance movement had a snowball effect says Amira Ahmed, who has more than a decade of experience working in and writing about the tech scene in Egypt.\n\n“There has been a much more deliberate building up of the ecosystem since 2011 and from then on, the momentum has only increased so that we’ve really seen the ecosystem start to take a more coherent shape.”\n\nAnd even though the drive for democracy largely failed, Waleed says it left many young people with the chutzpah to start their own businesses and get connected. “One of the biggest wins for the revolution is that it made a lot of people believe in themselves,” he said.\n\nWomen attend a cooking class conducted by Egyptian NGO Fard and Egyptian startup Mumm in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nTahrir Alley:\n\nThe best place to document the budding tech scene is to visit the GrEEK Campus located in downtown Cairo, just a few blocks from where the main revolution protests took place in Tahrir Square. Founded in 2013, the campus, also known as Tahrir Alley & Technology Park, is the first of its kind in the capital and offers private and co-working spaces to both startups as well as established multinational technology and media companies.\n\nLeased from the American University in Cairo, the hub was founded by Ahmed El Alfi, a former venture capitalist and a 2017 Quartz Africa Innovator. Over the years, El Afli has become an invaluable member of the Middle East and North Africa’s rapidly growing tech industry. He is the chairman of Sawari Ventures, a company that aims to transform regional economies through investments in high-impact businesses, and is also the co-founder of Flat6Labs, a leading regional startup accelerator that provides seed funding and mentorship to hundreds of entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nThe GrEEK Campus was established at a time when the local tech ecosystem was anything but favorable for Egyptian entrepreneurs. Too many obstacles stood in their way at the time, key among them access to finance. Ahmed also says that government red tape, poor infrastructure, lack of technical skills, laws that discourage entrepreneurship, and the inability to follow best business practices to ensure long-term sustainability were some of the problems that plagued the sector.\n\nBut El Alfi, who had been an early stage investor abroad for decades, was ready to incubate and nurture small businesses. One of the companies he co-founded at the time was Nafham, a free K-12 online education platform that provides 5-15 minutes video lessons covering Egyptian, Algerian, Saudi, and Syrian curricula from primary to secondary school. The platform has 23,000 videos with over 430,000 subscribers watching the lessons through its YouTube channel. The app also has tutors who answer students’ questions, and check the veracity of videos uploaded by contributors.\n\nMostafa Farahat, a co-creator of Nafham, says they wanted to see how digital technologies could disrupt educational provision in a country where poor infrastructure and overcrowded schools hinder the full development of children. After five years of operation, Farahat says they now want to experiment with artificial intelligence and how it can enhance greater levels of individualized learning. They also want to introduce a premium service model that would allow students to get much more comprehensive or tailored support from teachers.\n\nTechnology, he said, allows for solutions that “can have a great impact. You come to understand that the country could be transformed into something different or better.”\n\nThe eagerness to crack a problem that even governments are still unable to solve is also what pushed Mostafa Kandil to launch Swvl in early 2017. The bus transportation service in Cairo allows passengers to customize their journey by finding the shortest routes, reserve their space in a bus, and then pay their fares through the company’s mobile app. In a city with notorious traffic pr0blems, Kandil says Swvl provides an alternative to locals from the unreliable public transportation, the costly ride-sharing services, not to mention the hustle of fueling their own private cars amid a protracted fuel shortage crisis.\n\n“For us, it was like a no-brainer,” Kandil, who is a former executive at the Dubai-based Uber rival Careem, said. “The demand is insane. The supply is great.”\n\nJust three months after it started operation, Careem invested $500,000 into Swvl, which currently operates hundreds of buses and serves thousands of customers per day. Uber has also announced plans to launch a national bus service in Egypt.\n\nKandil says they hope to start operating in Alexandria by end of 2017, with possible expansion to Jordan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. “This mix of young people, who are talented and tech-savvy with a lot of problems to solve and a huge market to serve is like a secret sauce for building great stuff,” he said.\n\nBut to launch this grassroots tech movement into the global stage, there’s an urgent need to connect startups to relevant resources. Since 2013, Abdelhameed Sharara has run RiseUp Summit, an annual innovation event that brings together investors and entrepreneurs from both Egypt and all over the world in order to create new partnerships. The three-day event, which takes place at the GrEEK Campus, provides startups exposure, access to talent, contacts, and much-needed capital.\n\nThe RiseUp Summit at the GrEEK campus has grown to be the Middle East and North Africa’s largest innovation and entrepreneurship summit.\n\nThe rise of the summit’s profile has also encouraged investment programs like Injaz, Wamda, and Cairo Angels to further accelerate the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt. Following in these footsteps, the government also established an incubator, The Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, to drive innovation and benefit the national economy. Sharara says the main point behind the summit is to also pass the message that even though startups might fail, it is persistence that is key.\n\n“You want to connect start-ups with the most available resources but also inspire them,” Sharara told Quartz. “So there’s this huge, positive vibe that comes from this grassroots movement inside the event, close to what happened at the revolution.”\n\nImproving the ecosystem\n\nAs the ecosystem grows and accessing finance improves, observers say there’s need for big steps to improve the system. There’s a lot of focus on seed and early-stage funding, Ahmed says, but more venture capital and private equity funds have to come in to keep up with the growing number of start-ups that need to move up to their stage of development. If the government is serious about supporting the industry, they should also introduce policies that make it easy for companies to grow. Education systems should also foster modern analytical and digital know-how skills that many start-ups need.\n\n“The inspiring thing about entrepreneurs is that they always find a workaround. It shouldn’t be that way though,” Ahmed said.\n\nWaleed from Mumm says that these obstacles also push more innovators to tinker with the system, improve it, and create a better marketplace for all to compete in.\n\n“We still have so much to do,” Waleed agrees. “But there is this striving ecosystem that is growing very very quickly and it is governed by a social contract that has a lot of ethics that is geared towards building this space, and making Egypt a better place.”\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.\n",

Each 30-45 minute episode is dedicated to one song on an album. This season took on Kanye West’s 2010 hip-hop classic My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\nI asked Cuchna, who studied music composition, why he devotes so much time to just one piece of art, when there is so much variety out there to behold. In part, he’s resisting “falling victim to how we consume things now,” he says. “I found myself scrolling on my phone endlessly at night and feeling kind empty afterwards.” If an album or a piece of art resonates with you, Cuchna says, it’s worth taking the time to linger with it, exploring why it makes you feel that way. The podcast is a way for him to get back in the mindset of deep consideration.\n\nCuchna’s analysis of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is revelatory. In his more than 10-hour analysis of the album, Cuchna reveals how much more there is to the album than initially meets the ear. The surprises begin in Twisted Fantasy’s very first words, recited by the then relatively unknown rapper Nikki Minaj:\n\nYou might think you’ve peeped the scene\nYou haven’t, the real one’s far too mean\nThe watered down one, the one you know\nWas made up centuries ago\nThey made it sound all wack and corny\nYes, it’s awful, blasted boring\nTwisted fictions, sick addictions\nWell, gather ’round children, zip it, listen\n\nAlthough I was a fan of the album, I never appreciated the depth of these particular lyrics. On Dissect, Cuchna explains they are a reference to the British children’s author Roahl Dahl’s scary version of the Cinderella story. Kanye is announcing that his album is not about the fairy-tale version of becoming rich and famous, but the “dark twisted” one.\n\nThe record, Cuchna says, is about Kanye’s life spiraling out of control after his mother’s death and the fallout from his jumping on stage to interrupt Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The album ends with the song “Lost in the World,” which reflects West’s state of mind at the time.\n\nA sense of resolve\n\nEach podcast episode is rife with examples of West’s compositional virtuosity that would be difficult to appreciate unless, like Cuchna, you’ve spent months repeatedly listening to the album. For example, he points out that the song “Devil in a New Dress” is tonally ambiguous, with alternating minor and major chords (E major and D sharp minor) that never resolve to the “home” chord of the song (G sharp minor). This musical instability reflects the erratic relationship West describes in the song. It is only at the beginning of the next song on the album, “Runaway,” that we hear a G sharp minor chord, and feel some resolution.\n\nCuchna is rapturous when he talks about “Runaway.” He calls it the greatest song on one of the greatest albums every made. We learn that West’s inspiration for the song was Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti’s Musica Ricercata II, a piece highlighted in the movie Eyes Wide Shut. Listen to the first notes of each song and it is unmistakable.\n\nCuchna also highlights how the beginning of the song features a clever rhythmic trick. We assume the piano notes at the start are on the first and third beats of a traditional 4/4 time signature, but then the bass and drums come in and we realize the piano figure is centered on the 2nd and 4th notes. This may sound technical, but in his podcast Cuchna does a great job of showing how important details like this are to the listening experience. To that end, Dissect also discusses how “Runaway” includes exemplary uses of overtones and motivic development (pdf).\n\n“Runaway” ends with West’s greatest trick. The last note of the song is an E, and then the next song, “Hell of a Life,” starts on a B flat. The interval from a E to a B flat is what’s called a tritone. “The tritone is notorious in music history,” Cuchna explains. “It was banned by certain religions and in the 17th century, and called the ‘devil in music’ due to the way it sounds.” (You will hear this interval a lot in heavy metal music.) The tritone makes sense as a bridge from the cathartic and apologetic “Runaway” to the debauched “Hell of a Life,” in which West talks about his lust for a porn star.\n\nHow is Cuchna so sure this is intentional? He says there are just too many examples like it for them all to be coincidences. Plus, Kanye’s primary collaborator on the album, Mike Dean, is a classically trained composer who would be well aware of these musical references.\n\nHidden meanings\n\nThe first season of Dissect, dedicated to Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, is nearly as good as the second. Cuchna’s analysis highlights the narrative and lyrical complexity of Lamar’s album, revealing the double- and triple-meanings hidden throughout. After spending months with the To Pimp a Butterfly, Cuchna was blown away by Lamar’s ability to be “artful and meaningful, but remain appealing on a mass level.”\n\nThe first two seasons of Dissect were about hip-hop albums because Cuchna felt that the genre deserved more academic analysis. He is interested in exploring other types of music for future seasons. He says he’s interested in dissecting albums by Radiohead, Beyonce, Bon Iver, or maybe even a Beethoven symphony (he is partial to the 3rd, 5th, and 9th). The most common request from fans is that he do a Frank Ocean album.\n\nAfter speaking with Cuchna, I couldn’t help but feel jealous of the way he experiences life and art. Cuchna told me that before going to college to study music full-time in his mid 20s (he is now 34), he spent six years taking art and philosophy classes at community college in his hometown of Sacramento, while working for a coffee roaster. “I just took classes because I liked learning,” he says. “I didn’t have a degree in mind.”\n\nAfter school, he would listen to Great Courses lectures, which are audio recordings of college-level classes. He particularly loved the music composition professor Robert Greenberg’s class on Dimitri Shostakovich, Cuchna’s favorite composer. It served as a model for Dissect.\n\n“People should follow the art they are attracted to,” Cuchna says. “There is a reason that album or painting is resonating with you. I know from experience that if you don’t give it your full attention, you won’t get everything you could get out of it. I hope Dissect can provide the structure for someone to take that time, or inspire them to create that structure in their own life.”\n",

          "description": "In a popular 1988 song, the Egyptian actor and singer Medhat Salah sang about the desire to live in Kawkab Tani—or another planet. In the track, Salah spoke of wanting to put (in Arabic) an “impervious, tall, and abominable barrier between him and his self, between his body and soul, between day and night.”\n\nAlmost three decades later, the song is now an inspiration for a new photo project from the Egyptian art collective El Side Effect. At the heart of the new project—named after Salah’s song—is escapism and the distraction and relief that virtual reality offers from unpleasant realities. The collection visualizes scenes from everyday Egypt, amplified through evocative displays of outer space.\n\nThe “Kawkab Tani” or “Another Planet” project amplifies daily life through evocative displays of outer space. (Courtesy/ El Side Effect)\nIn the photos, we see Egyptians going about their daily grind, working at farms and selling goods at busy markets. Men in loose jellabiya garments lead their working horses and mules. Others crowd in a shop to buy the daily staple of pita bread. A man smokes shisha, another drinks tea; a woman and her son sit at a park, while another woman enjoys a swim clad in a hijab. But the mundane become momentous as the display of planetary bodies and star constellations add a complex twist to every image and improves the meaning behind it.\n\nEl Side Effect hopes wants Egyptians “to see everyday Egypt in a different light.” (Courtesy/ El Side Effect)\nThe conceptual artwork and the photos are by the creatives Ahmed Shalaby and Sarah Eweda, both of whom co-founded El Side. (Abdelrahman Ahmed also took some of the photos.) Eweda tells Quartz that the group was driven by the notion that art was everywhere around us, and that it could provide not only commentary on daily life but also challenge assumptions and tradition.\n\n“Sometimes you just want to distract yourself from reality and escape this world,” Eweda says. “Living here is getting harder by the minute, and to keep going you do what you do to escape.”\n\nPlanetary bodies and star constellations add a complex twist to daily mundane activities. (Courtesy/ El Side Effect)\nThe collection is being published at a time when African photographers and filmmakers are increasingly using digital storytelling and virtual reality to convey complex stories. Artists across the continent are also utilizing science fiction to reimagine historical narratives like the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya, or the future of local communities like the Maasai.\n\nIt is also no secret that space exploration has become a pressing priority for many African nations. Governments from Ethiopia to South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria have manufactured, launched, or operated satellites, all in the hope of powering their economic, technological, scientific, and even their military and intelligence ambitions.\n\nEl Side Effect say they want to make art accessible to all Egyptians. (Courtesy/ El Side Effect)\nEl Side’s photos also come at a time when Egyptians do need a lot of escape from their daily realities. Austerity measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund increased inflation, while deadly terrorist attacks continue to put a dent in Egypt’s image as a favorite tourist destination. The government continues to crack down on activists, and has blocked hundreds of websites as part of what it says is curbing websites that are “publishing false information” and “supporting terrorism.”\n\nEweda hopes the photos will offer Egyptians a fantasy break from this sometimes harsh reality. “We basically want them to see what we see. We want them to see everyday Egypt in a different light.”\n\nWith high inflation and low incomes, Egyptians do need an escape from reality.

          "description": "Econ 101, the introductory college economics course that is often held in overcrowded lecture halls packed with half-asleep freshmen, is finally getting a facelift.\n\nAt the front of the class is Raj Chetty, a 38-year-old economist who publishes some of the field’s most intriguing papers year after year. He’s used data to debunk the American Dream, challenge the Ivies as engines of social mobility, and become an authority on inequality. He’s shuttled from top university to top university, scored a MacArthur “genius” grant, and landed on Forbes’ 40 under 40 list.\n\nNow, at Stanford, he’s rethinking how to teach economics to a bunch of fresh-faced newbies to the field—and they’re loving it.\n\nChetty’s new class, “Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems,” attracted 200 students during the spring quarter. It was Stanford’s most popular economics class, with more students than the university’s equivalent of Econ 101 (145).\n\nAccording to Chetty, come the end of the quarter, some students noted that the class convinced them to major in economics. While Stanford’s economics department confirmed that eight more students are majoring in economics this year compared with last year, it also noted that a number of factors could be contributing to such enrollments, so it’s hard to say whether the bump has anything to do with Chetty’s class. Moreover, since Stanford students do not have to declare a major until their junior year, we may not see the full effect for another year or two.\n\nAnd now, anyone can take the class—the lecture series is online at The Equality of Opportunity Project.\n\nIt should be illegal to enjoy economics lectures the way I'm enjoying Raj Chetty's course on big data and economics\n\n— The Black Suarez (@DerinAdebayo) September 28, 2017\n\nSupply and demand\n\nThe class, in many ways, is a globally engaged, social-minded young person’s dream, with 11 lectures that address how big data is changing the way we think about upward mobility, education, health care, climate change, migration, criminal justice, and discrimination.\n\nRaj Chetty lecturing on “Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems”. (Equality of Opportunity Project/YouTube)\nWhat’s more, the class proved popular among people who aren’t usually drawn to economics. According to Chetty, far more women and minorities attended his course, and more came to office hours, which can be intimidating for the uninitiated. The department confirmed that close to half of Chetty’s class was female (84). More women also took Chetty’s class than the Stanford equivalent of Econ 101 (72). His impression is that the class upped the number of female and minority economics majors as well.\n\nEconomics is infamously unwelcoming to women and minorities. Of the 79 economics Nobel prizes ever awarded, only one has gone to a woman. Less than one in five tenured or tenure-track economics professors are women, and the gap between the share of women off and on the track remains high (pdf, p. 8). Women in the field are also penalized for teamwork: A study from Harvard found that men were just as likely to get tenure whether they published coauthored papers or not; women, instead, became less likely to gain tenure the more they worked with others.\n\nWhat gives? There’s some evidence that economics, as a discipline, simply isn’t friendly to women. This summer, a senior at Berkeley used cutting-edge techniques to categorize and study the comments of participants in EconJobRumors.com, an anonymous site used to discuss industry hires and openings. She found that words which best predict a conversation about a man, even if harsh, were typically job-related (“advisor”, “wharton,” “mathematician,” “nobel,” “goals”), but those for women were patronizing, sexual, and unrelated to the field (“hotter,” “gorgeous,” “tits,” “lesbian,” “feminazi”). It revealed, as one economist put it, “a cesspool of misogyny.”\n\nOthers blame the level of math in the field. People who are more likely to study math, computer science, or the hard sciences—men—have the deck stacked for them. This reinforces a culture that socializes women and minorities into believing they are less good at math, and consequently leads some to believe that to make economics more inclusive implies making it less technically rigorous.\n\nBut that doesn’t seem quite right, since STEM fields are more popular among female and minority undergrads than economics.\n\nComparative advantage\n\nIndeed, Chetty’s class didn’t shy away from the technical aspects of economics—big data, machine learning, and econometrics—and had no problem attracting women and minority students.\n\nSo why did his approach prove so popular?\n\nAn experiment at UC Berkeley offered a new PhD minor for engineers explicitly researching solutions for low-income communities: half the engineers in the inaugural class were women. MIT, meanwhile, launched an interdisciplinary lab that focused on building tech to improve the lives of those in poverty, and saw a class that was more than 70% women.\n\n“If the content of the work itself is made more societally meaningful, women will enroll in droves,” believes Lina Nilsson, an innovation director at UC Berkeley and one of MIT Technology Review’s 35 Innovators under 35.\n\nWhat if this were true in economics, too? Students who grew up in the low-income areas Chetty’s class studied were surprised to see their stories reflected in the field’s research. The professor remembers students filing into office hours and telling him, “I really see myself in these data, in this class.”\n\nChetty believes the class was ultimately a success because it tackled “things people felt really touched their lives personally, and mattered in terms of what they were reading in the news.”\n\nOf course, the class has only been offered once, so we’ll have to wait and see if its popularity endures (and if those who told Chetty they would declare an economics major stick to it). But Chetty has hope. He’s talking with faculty at other schools to roll out the program more widely.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Ready to save big on your next award flight?  You can use your AMEX Membership Rewards points to fly to Europe in Delta’s Business Class.  And I’ll show you how to get it even cheaper using the Virgin Atlantic 30% transfer bonus that runs through November 30, 2017.\n\nYou’ll also see how to fly to New Zealand, Hawaii, and Asia!\n\nThe Best Use of Virgin Atlantic Miles Isn’t Usually on Virgin Atlantic! I’ll Share the Best Partner Award Flights\nI’ll show you some of the best ways to use Virgin Atlantic miles to take advantage of that transfer bonus!\n\n1.   ANA First Class and Business Class Flights to Japan\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for ANA Flights\n\nANA (All Nippon Airways) is an award-winning Japanese airline with excellent Business Class and First Class cabins.  And they’re partners with Virgin Atlantic!\n\nEnjoy Terrific Food and Service in ANA First Class for Far Fewer Miles Than You’d Pay With Other Airlines\nRound-trip ANA award flights between Japan and the West Coast cost:\n\n 90,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\n110,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in First Class\n\nFrom the Midwest and the East Coast you’ll pay slightly more:\n\n95,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\n120,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in First Class\n\nWith the 30% transfer bonus from AMEX Membership Rewards to Virgin Atlantic, you’ll only need:\n\n70,000 to 74,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\n85,000 to 93,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in First Class\n\nNote:   The actual amounts are slightly lower, but you have to transfer AMEX Membership Rewards points to Virgin Atlantic in 1,000-point increments.\n\nThis is an incredible deal, especially because taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges are relatively low.  To compare, with other airlines between the US and Japan, you’ll pay:\n\n120,000 American Airlines miles round-trip in Business Class\n\n160,000 American Airlines miles round-trip in First Class\n\n140,000 United Airlines miles round-trip in Business Class (160,000 miles on partners)\n\n180,000 United Airlines miles round-trip in First Class (220,000 miles on partners)\n\nIf you want to go somewhere in Asia besides Japan, you’ll need to book a separate ticket (I recommend using British Airways Avios points to fly on Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, or Malaysia Airlines for as little as 4,500 British Airways Avios points one-way).\n\nUS ANA Destinations From Tokyo Narita and Haneda Airports\nTo book these awards, you’ll need to search for available award seats on United.com, because you can NOT search for ANA award flights on the Virgin Atlantic website.  Then call Virgin Atlantic at 800-365-9500 to book.\n\n2.   Delta Business Class to Europe (Except UK)\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for Delta Flights\n\nDelta is also a Virgin Atlantic partner airline.  And Delta’s flagship Business Class, called Delta One, is a comfortable way to get from the US to Europe.  With this transfer bonus, you can get a great deal on those flights!\n\nA non-stop, one-way flight from the US to Europe (except the UK) in Business Class costs 50,000 Virgin Atlantic miles.  So you’d pay just 39,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points with the current transfer bonus.\n\nFor comparison, these same flights would cost you at least 70,000 Delta miles.  Better yet, a one-way ticket starting in the US only has ~$6 in taxes, as long as you’re not flying to the UK.\n\nFly to Destinations Like Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome, in Comfortable Delta One Business Class for Just 50,000 Virgin Atlantic Miles One-Way\nIf you’re trying to get to the UK, pricing is completely different, because Delta and Virgin Atlantic have aligned their award charts between the US and the UK.  Those routes have variable pricing depending on what part of the US you’re coming from, and whether you’re flying during peak season.  For a one-way flight, you’ll pay 47,500 to 77,500 Virgin Atlantic miles, plus a whopping $500 surcharge.  So using Virgin Atlantic miles is NOT a good deal to or from the UK.\n\nNote:  Flights coming back from Europe to the US do have fuel surcharges, which can cost several hundred dollars.  So you might want to use your Virgin Atlantic miles to book your flight to Europe, and use other miles for your return flight.\n\nYou can search for Delta award flights and book them online at virginatlantic.com.\n\n3.   Hawaiian Airlines to Hawaii\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for Hawaiian Airlines Flights\n\nVirgin Atlantic’s partner Hawaiian Airlines has been rolling out lie-flat seats in Business Class, which makes them a great option to get from the US mainland to Hawaii.\n\nRound-trip Hawaiian Airlines award flights from the West Coast cost:\n\n40,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach\n\n80,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\nWith the 30% transfer bonus from AMEX Membership Rewards to Virgin Atlantic, you’ll only need:\n\n31,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n62,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nHawaiian Airlines Has Been Upgrading Their Long-Haul Business Class Seats Which Makes for a Much More Restful Flight Between the Mainland and Hawaii\nThat said, if you’re flying from the East Coast, it’s NOT a good deal (even with the transfer bonus).  You’ll pay (round-trip):\n\n80,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach\n\n130,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\nWith the transfer bonus, this works out to:\n\n62,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n100,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nTo compare, if you booked the same round-trip Hawaiian Airlines award flights (from anywhere in the US mainland) using Hawaiian Airlines miles, you’d pay 40,000 Hawaiian Airlines miles in coach, and 80,000 Hawaiian Airlines miles in Business Class.  And you can transfer AMEX Membership Rewards points to Hawaiian Airlines at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut from the West Coast, using Virgin Atlantic miles with the 30% AMEX transfer bonus is a nice deal!  And you’ll just pay a few dollars in taxes.\n\n4.   Hawaiian Airlines from Hawaii to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for Hawaiian Airlines Flights\n\nIf you want to start your vacation in Hawaii (or live there!), you can redeem Virgin Atlantic miles for Hawaiian Airlines award flights to destinations in China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as Papeete and Pago Pago in the South Pacific.\n\nVisit Japan Like Emily Did! Flights From Hawaii to Tokyo Are a Good Deal With Virgin Atlantic Miles and the 30% AMEX Transfer Bonus\nRound-trip Hawaiian Airlines award flights to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand from Hawaii cost:\n\n80,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach\n\n130,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\nWith the 30% AMEX transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic, you’d pay:\n\n62,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n100,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nThis is a better deal than using Hawaiian Airlines miles for the same flights, which cost 80,000 Hawaiian Airlines miles in coach, and 130,000 Hawaiian Airlines miles in Business Class.\n\nFly Between Hawaii and These Destinations in Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific on Hawaiian Airlines\nTo the South Pacific (Pago Pago, American Samoa, and Papeete, Tahiti) you’ll pay even fewer miles:\n\n55,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach\n\n95,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\nSo with the 30% AMEX transfer bonus, these cost:\n\n43,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n74,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nTo compare, Hawaiian Airlines charges the same as Virgin Atlantic for these flights.  So you’ll do better with the 30% transfer bonus!\n\nHawaiian Airlines does NOT have fuel surcharges, so you’ll only have to pay for taxes and fees.\n\n5.   Air New Zealand Business Class From the US to New Zealand\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for Air New Zealand Flights\n\nVirgin Atlantic partner Air New Zealand Business Class is a terrific experience!  They even have memory foam mattresses and full size pillows, plus great food!  You’ll want all of these things on such a long flight.\n\nNew Zealand Is on Many Folks’ Bucket Lists – and You Could Use Virgin Atlantic Miles to Fly There on Air New Zealand\nYou can book a round-trip Air New Zealand Business Class award ticket from the mainland US to New Zealand for:\n\n80,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach\n\n125,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class\n\nAfter the 30% AMEX transfer bonus, this equals:\n\n62,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n97,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nFly Air New Zealand Between Auckland and Houston, Los Angeles, or San Francisco\nTo compare, if you booked the same flights with United Airlines miles (a Star Alliance partner with Air New Zealand), you’d pay (round-trip):\n\n80,000 United Airlines miles in coach\n\n180,000 United Airlines miles in Business Class\n\nSo you’ll certainly save by using Virgin Atlantic miles with the 30% AMEX transfer bonus!\n\nAir New Zealand also flies to Honolulu, and those flights are a bit cheaper than their mainland US counterparts.  You’ll pay 60,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in coach or 90,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class (47,000 or 70,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points).  Watch out for fuel surcharges though!\n\n6.   Non-Stop Delta Flights Within the Continental US and Canada\n\nLink:   Virgin Atlantic Award Chart for Delta Flights\n\nYou can redeem 25,000 Virgin Atlantic miles to book a non-stop, round-trip flight in coach on partner Delta within the Continental US, Alaska, and Canada.  Or 45,000 Virgin Atlantic miles in Business Class.\n\nWhile that’s equivalent to the prices American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines charge for many domestic round-trip flights, you’ll end up doing better with Virgin Atlantic because of the transfer bonus.\n\nWith the 30% transfer bonus, for a round-trip non-stop Delta award flight, you’ll need:\n\n20,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in coach\n\n35,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points in Business Class\n\nFly Between Atlanta and Beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, on Delta for Less When You Transfer AMEX Membership Rewards Points to Virgin Atlantic\nYou can fly from Minneapolis or Salt Lake City to Anchorage, Alaska, New York City to Los Angeles or San Francisco, or Atlanta to Vancouver, British Columbia, or anywhere else Delta flies within the US!\n\nIf you want to fly in style, check out Delta’s flagship transcontinental service between certain cities on the West and East Coasts.  For 35,000 AMEX Membership Rewards points round-trip, you can fly in lie-flat Business Class on those routes.\n\nNote:   According to commenters at The Points Guy, Virgin Atlantic appears to have removed the option to book Delta lie-flat transcontinental seats.  I don’t know if this is a temporary glitch or permanent.\n\nIf you need a connection, Virgin Atlantic will charge you the full 25,000 miles for each flight, so this isn’t a good deal if you would have to take more than one flight to get to your destination.\n\nEarn More AMEX Membership Rewards Points\n\nThe following cards earn AMEX Membership Rewards points you can transfer to Virgin Atlantic and other airline and hotel partners:\n\nPersonal Cards\n\nBusiness Cards\n\nPremier Rewards Gold Card From American Express\n\nThe Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN\n\nThe Platinum Card® from American Express Exclusively for Mercedes-Benz\n\nThe Blue Business℠ Plus Credit Card from American Express\n\nThe

But you can use these points on the Membership Rewards website for other redemptions. Includes personal AND small business versions of the card.\n\nIf you prefer earning Virgin Atlantic miles directly, the 90,000-mile sign-up bonus on the Bank of America Virgin Atlantic card has returned!  But you’ll have to spend a lot to unlock the full sign-up bonus.\n\nKeep in mind, Virgin Atlantic miles expire after 3 years with no activity, so I do NOT recommend transferring miles if you don’t have a redemption in mind.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSpeculatively transferring miles due to a transfer bonus is rarely a good idea.  But the 30% transfer bonus from American Express Membership Rewards to Virgin Atlantic through November 30, 2017, opens up some great award flight opportunities.\n\nFor example, you can save by using Virgin Atlantic miles to book award flights like:\n\nUS to Asia in First or Business Class on ANA\n\nUS to Europe (except the UK) in Business Class on Delta\n\nWest Coast to Hawaii or Hawaii to Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific in coach and Business Class on Hawaiian Airlines\n\nUS to New Zealand in coach or Business Class on Air New Zealand\n\nDomestic non-stop flights in coach or Business Class on Delta\n\nIf you are planning an upcoming trip and haven’t booked flights yet, take a close look at Virgin Atlantic’s partner award charts (especially the ones outlined here!) to see if one is a good fit for your plans.\n",

          "description": "In most of life, you can screw up without drawing too much attention to yourself. This isn’t the case when you’re giving a presentation. All eyes are on you, judging you, and if you do a terrible job, all of them will notice. Right. Away.\n\nIt’s natural to respond to this brutal vulnerability by talking yourself into giving a terrible presentation. But you want to give a good presentation, so when you hear yourself say these five things, you need to talk back.\n\n“This is how it’s always done”\n\nAnd has that worked? If so, can you say that Now is as it’s always been? If you have a Yes to both questions, carry on. Buy a lottery ticket on the way home.\n\n“If my presentation is long, people will know I work hard”\n\nDoes length work for other people when you watch them? If you’re in a culture that needs you to show your work, consider this question: Are there other ways to demonstrate that you work hard while making a shorter presentation? For example, could you include a slide up front that lists all of the activities that got you to your point or offer a longhand document with all the workings?\n\n“I can’t let go of all the information”\n\nYou’re addicted. And here’s the thing, you aren’t letting go of everything altogether, you’re just being selective about how it shows up. You can print out all the information and sleep with it if you need the company. But you want the more important information to shine and not get drowned out by the noise of all the information.\n\n“If I use big words, people will think it’s more important”\n\nYes, but will they understand it? Will the people they’ll ask to help you understand it? At some point your thinking will leave the building—will people outside the building understand your points as you’ve phrased them?\n\n“Using uncommon words makes me feel vulnerable”\n\nIf you’re standing in front of people, believing in something, and asking them to enlist in your point, you’re already vulnerable. Yes, being creative is an act of deviance, and even though humans are wired for creativity, presenting ourselves in new ways makes us feel vulnerable because we fear rejection from the tribe. You’re vulnerable anyway, you’re a human. So, as you write, ask yourself: Is there a shorter, sharper word for this?\n\nOur brains are tricksters, and mental blocks are their weapons. When you catch yourself in the throes of another automated presentation, you must stop and give your brain some lip. Talk back to it. Trick it. Stand up for yourself and your ideas. If you can only handle one question and one jolt to your automatic tendencies, ask this: What’s one thing we can do differently this time? By the tenth presentation… hang on, you just did math ahead of me… yes, you’ll have done ten things differently, and a new approach will have emerged from the fires of presentation hell.\n\nThis article is part of a Quartz series on how to make “pointy” presentations.\n\nMark Pollard is the CEO at Mighty Jungle, a brand strategy agency in New York.\n",

          "description": "In national security, social network analysis is used to identify potential terrorists. In marketing, it can uncover the Instagram influencers who are best positioned to sell a company’s product.\n\nBut social network theory—the study of how different people or things interact with one another, often revealing the most influential and well-connected people among a certain population—can also, unexpectedly, explain the entire history of popular music.\n\nQuartz recently highlighted the musicians who affect our lives the most by looking at the artists whose work has influenced the most number of other artists, using information supplied by online music database AllMusic. Here are the top 25:\n\nDigging deeper, we can get even more profound insights into the trajectory of popular music by looking at measures outside of direct influence.\n\nFor instance, one simple measure is how much an artist has influenced multiple “generations.” The following chart combines musicians’ number of direct influences with the number of artists that those people have in turn influenced; think of the musicians topping the list as the “grandparents” of pop music, inspiring singers and songwriters decades down the line. Looking at the data this way, rock pioneers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard rise in the rankings.\n\nTo go even further, we can also look at the artists that serve as the connectors amongst other artists—a term known as “betweenness centrality.” This measures, essentially, the artists that would be most frequently brought up in a game of six degrees of separation. The artists that jump the most in the rankings by this metric are James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Michael Jackson, and Frank Zappa.\n\nMatthew Denny, a social network analysis researcher at Penn State University, explains the stylistic pattern behind these numbers: “A high betweenness centrality suggests you were more important in passing on traditions. Also, someone who created their own branch of music would score higher by this metric.” James Brown, for example, was influenced by early blues, rock, and jazz musicians and went on to inspire a generation of funk and hip-hop artists. His central place in music history stems from his role as a conduit for a range of musical traditions.\n\nBetweenness Centrality Ranking\n\nRank\n\nArtist\n\nChange in rank vs. direct influence\n\n1\n\nThe Beatles\n\n=\n\n2\n\nBob Dylan\n\n=\n\n3\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\n+5\n\n4\n\nMiles Davis\n\n+8\n\n5\n\nJames Brown\n\n+12\n\n6\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n-3\n\n7\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\n+9\n\n8\n\nBrian Eno\n\n+5\n\n9\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nThe Velvet Underground\n\n-4\n\n11\n\nKraftwerk\n\n+4\n\n12\n\nElvis Presley\n\n+11\n\n13\n\nStevie Wonder\n\n+16\n\n14\n\nSonic Youth\n\n=\n\n15\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\n-4\n\n16\n\nPrince\n\n+15\n\n17\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\n-12\n\n18\n\nPink Floyd\n\n+4\n\n19\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\n+8\n\n20\n\nNeil Young\n\n-13\n\n21\n\nThe Clash\n\n-2\n\n22\n\nDuke Ellington\n\n+14\n\n23\n\nMichael Jackson\n\n+30\n\n24\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\n+9\n\n25\n\nFrank Zappa\n\n+33\n\nAnother measure commonly used in social network analysis is “closeness centrality”: how many steps it would take for one person to reach all the other people in a given population. In music, this means that the artists who flit from genre to genre—or create their own sounds that defy categorization—are ultimately more influential than ones who rise to the top of one specific genre.\n\nNeil Young and the Beach Boys are both regarded as seminal figures in musical history, but they fall in this ranking, while Prince, a singer who actively eschewed genre, rises in impact. Others getting a boost by this measure include foundational rockers like Chuck Berry and Little Richard, as well as more idiosyncratic artists like George Clinton’s Funkadelic and German experimental group Can.\n\nCloseness Centrality Ranking\n\nRank\n\nArtist\n\nChange in rank vs. direct influence\n\n1\n\nThe Beatles\n\n=\n\n2\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\n+6\n\n3\n\nBob Dylan\n\n-1\n\n4\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n-1\n\n5\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n-1\n\n6\n\nJames Brown\n\n+11\n\n7\n\nThe Velvet Underground\n\n-1\n\n8\n\nMiles Davis\n\n+4\n\n9\n\nChuck Berry\n\n+23\n\n10\n\nBrian Eno\n\n+3\n\n11\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\n=\n\n12\n\nPink Floyd\n\n+10\n\n13\n\nElvis Presley\n\n+10\n\n14\n\nLittle Richard\n\n+100\n\n15\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\n+1\n\n16\n\nThe Stooges\n\n+2\n\n17\n\nFunkadelic\n\n+70\n\n18\n\nThe Who\n\n+2\n\n19\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\n-14\n\n20\n\nPrince\n\n+11\n\n21\n\nNeil Young\n\n-14\n\n22\n\nKraftwerk\n\n-7\n\n23\n\nThe Byrds\n\n-13\n\n24\n\nCan\n\n+24\n\n25\n\nSex Pistols\n\n+3\n\nUnfortunately, the available data is not granular enough to project this analysis forward, revealing which musicians active today will prove most influential in the future. Yet the basis for such work is there, with the patterns of influence in pop music history as clearly identifiable as the chorus of a song.\n\nWhat’s also clear is that whoever emerges in the rankings in the years to come—don’t bet on the Beatles being dethroned anytime soon.\n",

          "description": "One popular benefit offered on many premium credit cards is a membership to the Priority Pass lounge network. But until recently, only certain cards would let you use a virtual card to access the lounges. Notably absent: the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card. Even worse, these two cards have the most generous Priority Pass guesting policies, allowing unlimited guests to enter with the member at no cost.\n\nBecause of this restriction, if you have either of these two cards, up until now you needed to take your physical Priority Pass membership card with you when traveling. This confusion could lead to mistakes, like when TPG reader Janice used the wrong Priority Pass card and ended up with a $189 charge for using a lounge that she could’ve entered for free using the correct card.\n\nBut starting this week, cardholders of both the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card are eligible to set-up a digital Priority Pass card. When I spoke with Chase customer service about this development, the rep noted that this feature was just added Wednesday. Affected cardholders will be receiving letters soon about the change.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t have to delay your use of this new tool. Let’s walk through how to set-up your Priority Pass account for digital use.\n\nFirst, you’re going to need your physical Priority Pass card and know your Priority Pass membership expiration date to complete the digital setup. If you don’t have access to both of these, you can call Chase via the number on the back of your card. The customer service representative can connect you with a Priority Pass agent who will read off your account number and expiration date.\n\nOnce you have this info, here are the next steps:\n\nNavigate to http://ift.tt/2B1swJu\n\nEnter your card number, expiration date and solve the Captcha.\n\nSet-up a Priority Pass account by providing your email address and setting up login information. If you already have a Priority Pass account, it looks like you’re going to have to set-up a new account for this card; I haven’t found a way to add a membership to an existing account.\n\nDownload the Priority Pass app (Google Play and Apple Store)\n\nOpen the app and log in with your new account. Note that you can have multiple accounts linked on the app.\n\nSelect the menu bar and select “My Digital Card” to confirm that the digital card is available.\n\nKeep in mind that not all lounges accept the digital card. So, it can’t hurt to bring the physical card along with you when you travel. However, now you’ll at least have a shot of entering lounges if you forget.\n\nWant to learn more about Priority Pass?

          "description": "After a fifth woman accused Roy Moore of sexual misbehavior or assault, US senate majority leader and fellow Republican Mitch McConnell urged the Alabama senate nominee to withdraw, saying, “I believe the women.”\n\nHis visible and vocal stance regarding Moore sharply contrasts with how supporters of Donald Trump have responded to at least 17 women who have accused him of various degrees of sexual harassment, voyeurism, and assault. Their claims against the US president span three decades. During his campaign, Trump vociferously denied each accusation, adding in one instance that the woman in question “would not have been my first choice.”\n\nRepublican leaders spoke out against Trump in October 2016, when an Access Hollywood tape emerged in which Trump can be heard bragging that he could “grab [women] by the pussy.” But they did not defend the women who came forward with assault allegations against Trump, nor did they suggest their claims were credible.\n\nAs the calendar ticked forward to the presidential vote, GOP figures who had briefly distanced themselves from Trump got behind him again. His accusers’ stories faded to the background. The media moved on to other things. Trump was elected.\n\nNow that he has sided with Moore’s accusers, McConnell was asked on Nov. 15 if he believes the women who similarly accused Trump. He would not answer. “Look, we’re talking about the situation in Alabama,” he told reporters. “And I’d be happy to address that if there are any further questions.”\n\nMAGA. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)\nThe post-Weinstein world\n\nThough just over a year has passed since the election, the claims against Moore have come to light into a very different world than those raised against Trump. Revelations about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein have prompted a torrent of new allegations, which cost powerful men in entertainment, media, and politics their jobs.\n\nViral hashtag campaigns including #MeToo and #MeAt14 have given thousands of women on social media the opportunity to speak out against the sexual abuse, harassment, and assault they have experienced. Another one, #TrumpToo, has gained new currency.\n\nWelcome home, @RealDonaldTrump! While you were gone we started actually punishing people for sexual harassment so, you know, heads up.\n\n— Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) November 15, 2017\n\nNow may be the time to look at public accusations against Trump again, to view them anew in a rapidly changing political and social climate. Trump has never been charged with a sexual-misconduct crime, and has adamantly denied each claim listed below. But the world’s approach to women who say they have been victimized by sexual misconduct is changing—and so are the consequences for men who are accused.\n\nLanguage also matters. Much of the coverage of the accusations waged against Trump last fall used wording like “groping,” “inappropriate touching,” or “fondling” to describe behavior that could constitute sexual assault. As Laura Bates, author of Everyday Sexism and Girl Up, wrote in the Guardian, using euphemistic language both downplays the severity of the offense being alleged and undercuts the distress felt by the women who came forward.\n\nThree women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or misconduct stand with attorney Gloria Allred at the Women’s March on Washington. (Reuters/James Lawler Duggan)\nBelow are the stories of 17 women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Their allegations have been categorized according to how the US legal system might assess and investigate them.\n\nA note on terminology: The US Justice Department defines sexual assault as “any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.” This includes forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape. According to the National Institute of Justice, sexual assault can also include voyeurism, exposure to exhibitionism, and undesired exposure to pornography.\n\nThe 17 named accusers of Donald Trump\n\n1. Jessica Leeds (1980s)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\n\nJessica Leeds, now 75, told the New York Times (video) last year that Trump assaulted her when she was seated next to him on a flight to New York in the 1980s.\n\nAfter speaking with her for some time, she said, Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her, grabbing her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt.\n\nShe said she did not report the incident to airline staff or the authorities, because she saw that kind of unwanted behavior as commonplace. “We accepted it for years,” she told the Times. “We were taught it was our fault.”\n\nLast month, Leeds told the Washington Post she felt dismayed that Weinstein had been brought down by his accusers, yet Trump remained in office: “It is hard to reconcile that Harvey Weinstein could be brought down with this, and Trump just continues to be the Teflon Don.”\n\n2. Ivana Trump (1989)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual intercourse)\n\nIn a divorce deposition  in 1990, Trump’s first wife, Ivana, described an event in 1989 in which Trump physically assaulted her and then forced himself on her. Details were made public in the 1993 Trump biography “Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,” by Harry Hurt III, who obtained the sealed deposition and confirmed the account with two of her friends before publishing it.\n\nPer “Lost Tycoon,” Trump was angry with Ivana after he underwent a procedure to eliminate a bald spot by a plastic surgeon she had recommended. He allegedly pulled out some of his wife’s hair and then had sex with her in a way that left her feeling “violated.” In Hurt’s account, she spent the night locked in the bathroom, crying, only to emerge in the morning to have Trump ask her: “Does it hurt?”\n\nTrump has denied the allegations. A statement from Ivana was later added to the first page of “Lost Tycoon,” in which she softens her language, but stands by the substance of the allegation. “During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” the statement said. “[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.”\n\nIn 2015, Michael Cohen, then special counsel at the Trump Organization, now a lawyer and spokesman for the president, incorrectly told the Daily Beast that “you cannot rape your spouse.” (While there was once a “marital rape exemption” in New York, that ended in 1984.)\n\nIvana also revised her original account of the incident in a 2015 statement to CNN:\n\nI have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.\n\nIn October, Ivana again spoke favorably of her ex-husband in an interview with CBS News, in which she said they remain in regular contact.\n\n3. Kristin Anderson (1990s)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\n\nPhotographer Kristin Anderson said she was sitting on a couch with friends at a crowded Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s when she felt a hand go up her skirt and touch her vagina through her underwear.\n\n“I basically just pushed the hand away, turned and looked, got up off the couch, and we all moved,” she told CNN last year. She said she immediately recognized the perpetrator as Donald Trump.\n\n“He was so distinctive looking—with the hair and the eyebrows. I mean, nobody else has those eyebrows,” she told the Washington Post. She recalled gathering with her friends after the incident and deciding to take their evening elsewhere: “Okay, Donald is gross. We all know he’s gross. Let’s just move on.”\n\n4. Jill Harth (1992)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\nSexual harassment\n\nJill Harth said she met Trump in 1992 when she was dating one of his business associates, George Houraney. In a 1997 lawsuit (later dropped), Harth said Trump made comments or advances that left her feeling uncomfortable, and ultimately assaulted her. “Trump repeatedly put his hands on plaintiff’s thighs and violated plaintiff’s ‘physical and mental integrity’ by attempting to touch plaintiff’s intimate private parts,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe suit alleges a series of lewd comments and verbal harassment, which culminated in an incident around Jan. 24, 1993, when Harth attended a business meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In Harth’s recounting, Trump kept her from leaving and “forcibly removed” her to a bedroom, where he subjected her to “unwanted sexual advances, which included touching of plaintiff’s private parts in an act constituting attempted ‘rape.'”\n\nHarth later dropped the complaint. In 1998, she began a months-long consensual relationship with Trump. When asked by Times columnist Nicolas Kristof why she would agree to date a man she had accused of attempted rape, she said she was in the midst of a divorce and was scared, “thinking, ‘what am I going to do now?”\n\n“When he called me and tried to work on me again, I was thinking maybe I should give this a try, maybe if he’s still working on me, I should give this rich guy a chance,” Harth told Kristof last October.\n\nTrump spokesperson Hope Hicks told Kristof that Trump “denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth.” At the time, the campaign also released e-mails that they said discredited Harth’s account, including messages in which Harth asks for jobs doing Trump’s hair and makeup.\n\nOver the years, and in Kristof’s column, Harth has stood by her initial claim of harassment and assault. She spoke most recently with the Guardian about her experiences, saying Trump had pulled off “the biggest con possible” in winning the presidency.\n\nSad you had to go through it. My pain is everyday with bastard Trump as President.  No one gets it unless it happens to them. NO one!\n\n— Jill Harth (@jillharth) October 10, 2017\n\n5. Cathy Heller (1997)\nNonconsensual kissing\n\nCathy Heller told the Guardian that in 1997 she was at a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago with her husband, three children, and in-laws when Trump was greeting members. When he arrived at their table, Heller said she reached out for a handshake but “he took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips.” She said she leaned backward to avoid him, almost losing her balance, and again, he “grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips,” she told the Guardian. “He kept me there for a little too long, and then he just walked away.”\n\nSpeaking to the Washington Post after the Weinstein revelations were made public, Heller, now 64, said she wondered whether the fact that the movie producer’s accusers were famous is what held more weight for the general public. “When it’s a celebrity, it has more weight than just someone who he met at Mar-a-Lago or a beauty pageant contestant,” she said. “We’ll see about Trump. It’s never too late.”\n\n6. Temple Taggart McDowell (1997)\nNonconsensual kissing\n\nTemple Taggart McDowell was the 21-year-old representative for Utah in the Miss USA pageant when she said Trump unexpectedly kissed her at a rehearsal.\n\n“He embraced me and gave me a kiss on the lips,” McDowell told NBC last year. Another time, he did the same thing when she was visiting Trump Tower at his invitation, doing so in front of two pageant chaperones and a receptionist, McDowell said. “I would never approach or greet anybody like that unless it was somebody that I had been dating,” she told NBC.\n\n7. Mariah Billado (1997)\nVoyeurism\n\nMiss Vermont Teen USA in the 1997 pageant, Mariah Billado told BuzzFeed News she was shocked when Trump walked in to the dressing room while contestants, some of whom were as young as 15, were getting ready.\n\n“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my God, there’s a man in here,’” she said, adding she remembered Trump saying something along the lines of: “Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.”\n\n“I was in shock,” Karena Virginia told reporters last year. (Reuters/Carlo Allegri)\n8. Karena Virginia (1998)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\n\nYoga instructor Karena Virginia said that Trump groped her breast and made misogynistic comments during an encounter in Queens, New York when she was 27.  She said at a press conference last year (video) that she was waiting for a car to take her home after a 1998 US Open tennis match when Trump walked up to her with a small group of men.\n\n“I was surprised when I overheard him talking to the other men about me,” making comments about her legs and appearance, Virginia said. “He then walked up to me and reached out his right arm and grabbed my right arm. Then his hand touched the right side of my breast,” she said. “I was in shock. I flinched. ‘Don’t you know who I am? Don’t you know who I am’—that’s what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless.”\n\nVirginia said that she felt ashamed and blamed herself for the encounter for years.\n\n9. Bridget Sullivan (2000)\nVoyeurism\n\nFormer Miss New Hampshire Bridget Sullivan told BuzzFeed News in the spring of 2016 that Trump would come into the dressing rooms backstage at the 2000 Miss USA pageant when contestants were naked, staring at them. “The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking. We were all naked,” she said.\n\nIn October of last year, CNN unearthed audio of Trump on the Howard Stern radio show in 2005, in which Trump brags about the behavior described by Sullivan. In Trump’s words:\n\n“I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it.\n\nYou know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good. You know, the dresses. ‘Is everyone okay?’ You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible-looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.”\n\nIn his element. (Reuters/Jamie Fine)\n10. Tasha Dixon (2001)\nVoyeurism\n\nFormer Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon, 18 when she competed in the Miss USA pageant, also said Trump subjected her and others to voyeurism.\n\n“Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked, changing into our bikinis,” Dixon told local media. “He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\nShe said the brazen behavior put the contestants in a deeply uncomfortable spot. In her words:\n\nThe owner comes waltzing in when we were naked or half naked in a very physically vulnerable position, and then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention.\n\n11. Mindy McGillivray (2003)\nSexual assault (Nonconsensual touching)\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2003, Mindy McGillivray joined her friend, photographer Ken Davidoff, for an assignment at Mar-a-Lago, where a Ray Charles concert was taking place. According to McGillivray’s account in the Palm Beach Post, she was there to keep track of who Davidoff took pictures of.\n\nMcGilligray, then 23, said she was backstage when she felt someone grab her from behind. “I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald,” she told the Post last year. “He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I’m stunned.”\n\nNot wanting to make a scene, she said she didn’t do anything. Asked by a reporter whether it could have been an accident, McGillivray said she was sure it was not: “This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab. It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.’’\n\nWhile Davidoff did not witness the alleged assault, he said he believed McGillivray and also spoke to the Post to corroborate her story.\n\n12. Rachel Crooks (2005)\nNonconsensual kissing\n\nRachel Crooks, one of the first women to come forward publicly against Trump last year, was a 22-year-old receptionist working at a real-estate company in Trump Tower when she ran into him outside an elevator in 2005.\n\nAccording to her account in the New York Times, they shook hands. Then Trump did not let go, kissing her cheeks, and then “directly on the mouth.” “It was so inappropriate, Crooks told the Times. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.”\n\n13. Natasha Stoynoff (2005)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching and kissing)\n\nIn December, 2005, Natasha Stoynoff was a writer for People magazine, assigned to a story on the first anniversary of Melania and Donald Trump’s wedding. At Mar-a-Lago for a photo shoot and interview, Stoynoff said Trump brought her into a room with the guise of showing her around the estate, then shut the door and began kissing her. “I turned around and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,” she wrote in the magazine last year. “I was grateful when Trump’s longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.”\n\n“My shock began to wear off and was replaced by anger. I kept thinking, Why didn’t I slug him? Why couldn’t I say anything?” she wrote.\n\nSix people came forward to say she had told them of the incident, including the publication’s east-coast news editor, Liz McNeil. “She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,” McNeil said. “The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.”\n\nTrump’s campaign called Stoynoff’s account a “fictional story.” Charles Hardner, a lawyer for Melania Trump, wrote in a letter to Stoynoff after the People story published that some statements in Stoynoff’s account are “false and completely fictionalized,” and demanded a retraction.\n\nJessica Drake speaks to reporters last year. (Reuters/Kevork Djansezian)\n14. Jessica Drake (2006)\nNonconsensual kissing\n\nAdult-film actress Jessica Drake said she was at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe at an event for Wicked Pictures in 2016 when she met Trump in the celebrity gift room.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last year (video), she said Trump flirted with her and asked her for her phone number, which she gave him.\n\nDrake said that Trump then invited her up to his suite, and because she did not feel comfortable going alone, two other women joined her. “When we entered the room, he grabbed each of us tightly in a hug, and kissed each one of us without asking permission. He was wearing pajamas. A bodyguard was also present,” Drake said.\n\nTrump denied Drake’s story as “pure fiction,” while referencing her profession as an adult film actress seemingly to undercut her claim. In Trump’s words:\n\nOne said, ‘he grabbed me on the arm.’ And she’s a porn star. You know, this one that came out recently, ‘he grabbed me and he grabbed me on the arm.’ Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before.\n\n15. Ninni Laaksonen (2006)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\n\nA model who represented Finland in the Miss Universe competition, Ninni Laaksonen told the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat in October that Trump had groped her before an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in 2006.\n\n“Before the show we were photographed outside the building,” she told the paper, per a translation in the Telegraph. “Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. “I don’t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: ‘What is happening?’”\n\nSummer Zervos alleges Trump sexually assaulted her after she appeared on “The Apprentice.” (Reuters/Mike Blake)\n16. Summer Zervos (2007)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching and kissing)\n\nSummer Zervos said Trump subjected her to sexual harassment and assault when she tried to consult him as a mentor and potential employer after her appearance on “The Apprentice.”\n\nSpeaking at a press conference last year (video), Zervos said she met Trump in 2007 in New York, when he unexpectedly kissed her on the lips as a greeting, an action that surprised and embarrassed her. Later that year in Los Angeles, she said, he asked to meet for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel. When she arrived, she said that rather than being taken to a restaurant, she was led by a security guard to a bungalow with a bedroom.\n\nWhen she entered, she said he kissed her again. When she tried to make conversation instead, he asked her to sit down next to him, which she did. In her telling, Trump then “grabbed my shoulder and placed his hand on my breast.” She tried to stand up and get away, but he pulled her into a bedroom. She said she again tried to leave, and push him off, saying “Come on man, get real.” He said he repeated her words back to her, “Come on man, get real,” while thrusting his genitals on her. They ultimately had dinner in the room, and she said she left feeling violated and distraught. “I wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test or whether or not I had passed,” she said.\n\nZervos said the Access Hollywood tape had motivated her to come forward with her story, saying she would like to tell Trump that “you do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star.”\n\nWhen Zervos initially went public with her claims last year, Trump released the following statement, denying the events took place:\n\nTo be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life. In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14 of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California.\n\nIn January, lawyer Gloria Allred filed a complaint on behalf of Zervos in New York, which alleges she was “ambushed by Mr. Trump on more than one occasion,” and that Trump had “suddenly, and without her consent, kissed her on her mouth repeatedly; he touched her breast; and he pressed his genitals up against her.”\n\nLast month, Trump addressed Zervos’ claims, this time calling the allegations “fake news.”\n\n“It’s just fake. It’s fake. It’s made-up stuff, and it’s disgraceful, what happens, but that happens in the—that happens in the world of politics,” he said.\n\n17. Cassandra Searles (2013)\nSexual assault (nonconsensual touching)\n\nIn a Facebook post last June, Cassandra Searles, who competed as Miss Washington in the 2013 Miss USA pageant, said Trump “treated us like cattle.”\n\nIn the comments section on the post, other contestants she had tagged in the initial post shared their experiences, and in one comment Searles wrote, according to a report in Rolling Stone: “He probably doesn’t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”\n\nTrump continues to deny the allegations\n\nQuartz reached out to the White House for comment on this story but did not receive a response. We will update this story if a statement is made available.\n\nAt a press briefing on Oct. 22, Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked again about the accusations made against the president during the course of the campaign.\n\n“Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying?”Jacqueline Alemany of CBS News asked.\n\n“Yeah,” Sanders responded. “We’ve been clear on that from the beginning and the president has spoken on it.”\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "When Warby Parker was founded in 2010, the pitch was simple: Don’t buy expensive designer eyeglasses in stores; buy cheaper ones on the internet.\n\nIt was a good pitch. It was also a financial necessity: The founders had no outside capital and it was far cheaper to build a national brand online than to open a dozen storefronts in malls across the country with debt. But as Warby Parker grew to become a darling of online retail, the founders had a funny idea. Maybe they should undisrupt the brick-and-mortar industry by opening a store or two.\n\nWithin a year, there were eight Warby Parker brick-and-mortar locations nationwide. They weren’t just turning a profit. They were averaging $3,000 a square foot annually, higher than Tiffany, Ralph Lauren, and practically every company not named Apple. By the end of this year, the company will have about 80 storefronts.\n\nSo, is Warby Parker still an “online retailer”? Obviously, no: More than half of its sales now occur in physical stores. But also, yes: As founder Dave Gilboa told PBS, “about 75 percent of our customers that shop in our stores have been to our website first.”\n\nWarby Parker’s success is extraordinary. But this story is becoming quite ordinary, indeed. Online shopping is having an offline moment, as more e-commerce companies, such as RentTheRunway and Bonobos, invest in the very sort of physical stores they once made seem obsolete. Leading the trend is Amazon, the undisputed king of online shopping, which spent $14 billion to buy Whole Foods and its nearly 500 physical locations. According to internal documents, the company believes there is support for another 2,000 Amazon Fresh–branded grocery stores.\n\nThis throwback revolution is happening in the midst of what otherwise feels like a “retail apocalypse.” Bankruptcies are rising among clothing chains, like Wet Seal, and retail icons, like Toys “R” Us, which are stuck with a glut of shopping space and squeezed between stagnating sales and large debt obligations. The labor market in retail, once the powerhouse of the service economy, is having its worst year of the century.\n\nIn short, the retail industry is at an inflection point, where several brick-and-mortar companies with large footprints are struggling while e-commerce companies that once launched pop-ups as mere marketing tools have realized the value of storefronts. Indeed, Amazon sees an uptick in online shopping in regions where it’s opened a physical store, according to CNBC. “Five years from now, we won’t be debating whether ‘e-tailers’ are taking share from ‘brick & mortar retailers,’” Citi Research analysts recently wrote, “because they are all the same.” The trend even comes with an inevitable, and regrettable, catchphrase: “bricks and clicks.”\n\nThese trends are well known among retail analysts and writers. Less considered is how this inflection point in retail will affect the national economy, regional inequality, and the labor force more broadly. As department stores close in malls with lower sales-per-square foot—so-called Class C and D malls—regional shopping centers may shut down, turning once vibrant areas into urban blights. As richer urban and suburban stores revamp to appear more like showrooms, the role of the cashier—the second-most-common job in America—may be outsourced to websites. Here are four implications of this shift.\n\n1. The new youth shopping slogan: “Let’s go to the mall to buy stuff online.”\n\nLast year may have been the peak for the sheer amount of mall space in America, according to Cowen and Company, an investment bank. J.C. Penney, Macy’s, and Sears, which often “anchor” malls as the largest leasers, have each announced more than 100 store closures this year.\n\nAs mall landlords lose their legacy anchors, they are plugging vacancies with restaurants, fitness centers, and new storefronts for formerly “online” retailers. According to Sandeep Mathrani, the CEO of the mall operator GGP, the ideal modern mall isn’t built around one department store, but rather a supermarket, a Tesla store, and businesses that started out online, such as Warby Parker.\n\nAmong the nation’s top 300 malls, brick-and-mortar space occupied by retailers that started online has grown by approximately 1,000 percent since 2012, according to the real-estate data company CoStar Group. While they currently account for a minuscule part of mall volume, landlords increasingly consider them critical to attracting Millennials to these malls in the first place.\n\nAt Century City, an open-air mall in Los Angeles with a new billion-dollar makeover, tenants include Bonobos, the apparel store recently bought by Walmart, Untuckit, which was founded selling casual men’s shirts, Warby Parker, and Amazon Books.* Some of these stores, like Bonobos, don’t have inventory that shoppers can buy and take out of the store. Instead, shoppers place orders that are filled at fulfillment center and shipped to their doorstep. It may be increasingly common to leave a mall having spent a couple hundred dollars without one bag to take to the car.\n\nCentury City is in West Los Angeles, one of the richest and most retail-friendly zip codes in the country. Not every mall is so lucky …\n\n2. The brick-to-clicks transformation will accentuate retail’s regional inequality problem.\n\nOnline stores like Warby Parker and Bonobos prefer to open stores in their most profitable zip codes. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods gives the company a footprint in rich downtown areas and high-income suburbs.Today’s new retailers “need fewer stores, but in good locations, as those stores become that much more important to distribution,” according to Citi Research.\n\nMeanwhile, suburban malls in lower-income areas are truly struggling. Cowen and Company projects that up to 400 malls may close in the coming years, and they will be almost all Class C and D malls. Department store closings are already concentrated in the low-income suburbs of Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. When an anchor store like J.C. Penney closes, it triggers a downward spiral, where fewer shoppers means less foot traffic for adjacent retailers. That’s why many stores have clauses in their contracts that allow them to leave a mall if an anchor disappears. (Some high-income areas have a related problem: The many “available for lease” signs plastered around SoHo, New York City, may suggest a gap between the demands of new retailers looking for flexible short-term space and the real-estate owners holding out for longer-term leases.)\n\nA dead mall is more than just a hollowed-out commercial space. In many suburbs, malls are critical to the local economy and the community. Their death hurts jobs and local tax revenues. It’s possible that some of these defunct mall spaces may be reclaimed as fulfillment centers for e-commerce. Indeed, some of Amazon's largest fulfillment centers are in places like Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Ruskin, Florida.\n\nBut the “retail” workers there will do very different jobs …\n\n3. The fall of the cashier, the rise of the box filler.\n\nThe cashier is one of the most common jobs in America, with more than 3.5 million workers in the U.S. As more high-end shopping takes place in showrooms where shoppers can place online orders, there will be less need for cashiers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the total number to decline over the next 10 years.\n\nThe cashier job was buoyed by the last evolutionary stage of retail, the rise of the big-box store. These superstores, like Walmart, were a boon for low prices and all low pay. Retail productivity doubled between 1987 to 2007, but average real wages for retail workers declined during this time. E-commerce, however, makes shopping even more productive, mostly by replacing the vast majority of consumer “work.”\n\n“Americans spend 1.2 billion hours each week driving to the mall, finding a parking space, wandering around the aisles, checking out, and driving home,” the economist Michael Mandel writes. All of that unpaid activity is being turned into paid work in fulfillment centers. These warehouses, where online orders are filled and shipped, have added more than 400,000 jobs in the last decade. Some of Amazon’s largest fulfillment centers have more than 2,000 permanent employees with up to 1,000 seasonal workers.\n\nFrom a wage perspective, this may be a positive shift. Mandel’s research estimates that fulfillment centers pay 30 percent more than cashiers for work that still only requires a high-school degree. But companies like Amazon are spending billions of dollars on automation technology in fulfillment centers that may limit the growth of these jobs in the next decade.\n\n4) Self-driving cars are going to change everything, all over again.\n\nSelf-driving cars are a futurist’s paradox. They are universally predicted by both software companies and auto manufacturers; and yet, the way they will be integrated into our lives and streets remains unpredictable.\n\nBut one potentially exciting (or concerning) vision is that retail companies will see an autonomous vehicle as the ultimate commercial real estate. Why drive to a pop-up store, they will say, when the pop-up store can drive to you? The proliferation of self-driving cars would be of obvious use to companies like Walmart and Amazon, who need cheap ways to move products to people’s doorsteps. But they may prove to be helpful to both the Goliaths and the Davids of commerce. Retail start-ups of the self-driving age may start with an autonomous truck full of boutique merchandise that makes scheduled stops in highly trafficked areas but leaves “bookable time” for shoppers to order the merch to their front door.\n\nLeft unregulated, self-driving delivery trucks and autonomous retailers could further empty urban and suburban malls, flood the streets, and cause traffic mayhem for noncommercial drivers—that is, ordinary people. It’s impossible to know exactly how city regulations and autonomous technology will conspire to change e-commerce. But one can imagine how, in several decades, today’s online shopping companies, having changed shopping forever, will eventually find themselves to be the nation’s legacy retailers, struggling to adopt to the era’s new disruptive technology.\n\n*This article originally described the Century City mall as newly opened.

          "description": "The number of reported hate crimes in 2016 increased by nearly 5 percent to more than 6,100, according to a new report by the FBI.\n\nAs has long been true, hate crimes based on race were by far the biggest category, with more than half of reported hate crime incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, or ancestry. Among those, nearly half were anti-black crimes, and nearly 10 percent were anti-Latino. About one in five were anti-white, although white people were still much less likely, when accounting for total population, to suffer a hate crime than minority groups.\n\nHate crimes motivated by religion were the next biggest category, making up more than 20 percent of reported incidents. Jewish and Muslim people were the two most common targets in this category.\n\nCompared to 2015, there were increases in reported hate crimes nearly across the board. Reported anti-Muslim hate crimes rose by nearly 20 percent, anti-white by 17 percent, anti-Latino by 15 percent, and anti-Jewish by 3 percent. The number of anti-black crimes remained nearly flat from 2015 to 2016.\n\nThere were also increases in hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation — by about 2 percent — and gender identity — by nearly 9 percent. Together, those two types of hate crimes made up nearly one in five of all hate crimes reported by the FBI in 2016.\n\nNearly 26 percent of reported hate crimes were intimidation. About 24 percent were assault. More than 41 percent were property crimes. And five total were murders.\n\nThe FBI reported a nearly 7 percent rise in hate crimes in 2015, driven in large part by a 67 percent increase in reported hate crimes against Muslims.\n\nAlthough the FBI report is the most comprehensive look at the nation’s hate crimes released every year, the report is known to be woefully inadequate — because it may undercount the number by the hundreds of thousands, based on other federal surveys.\n\nBut the report gives a glimpse at the numbers in a year in which concerns about hate crimes skyrocketed due to President Donald Trump’s campaign and election. Research shows that support for Trump was driven largely by racial resentment, and Trump played into that resentment with his own racist rhetoric. As a result, Trump’s election led to widespread fears that there would be an emboldening of racist acts across America. (Indeed, some attendees at the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August — made up of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klan members — cited Trump as partial inspiration for the demonstration.)\n\nThe FBI report doesn’t prove there was a Trump-driven increase in hate crimes in 2016. But it shows there was, at least, an increase in the FBI’s figures that year.\n\nAmerica’s hate crime data is really bad\n\nIn the month after Trump was elected, there were more than 860 reports of hate attacks to the Southern Poverty Law Center — including school teachers making Islamophobic comments, students telling Latino peers that Trump would deport them, and outright physical violence that was seemingly motivated by racism. \n\nThere have also been reports of mosques being burned, violent attacks against Indians, and a drive-by shooting at the Tulsa, Oklahoma, headquarters for the LGBTQ organization Oklahomans for Equality. And then there were the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, in which a Nazi sympathizer allegedly killed a woman after he drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters. Not all of these attacks have been verified as acts motivated by bigotry, but they’re certainly a cause for alarm. \n\nThe reality, though, is it’s hard to say if hate crimes are on the rise — even after the FBI’s latest report — because the data used to track these cases is so poor.\n\nOver the past two decades, the FBI reported between 6,000 and 10,000 hate crimes each year in the US. But when the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) surveyed large segments of the population between 2007 and 2011 to try to gauge the real number of hate crimes, it concluded that there are nearly 260,000 such crimes annually.\n\nSo the FBI, although it’s supposed to be our most reliable source of current nationwide crime data, is potentially undercounting hate crimes by a magnitude of more than 40 times. Yet short of the BJS doing another in-depth survey and analysis on this issue, the FBI provides the best national data we have for more recent years.\n\nThis makes it difficult to know for certain if the number of hateful acts we have seen since Trump campaigned and was elected actually represent an increase in the total number of hate crimes. The hate crime experts I’ve talked to said there’s likely been an uptick given Trump’s rhetoric and support from white supremacists, but it’s impossible to say for sure without better hard data.\n\nWhat makes a hateful act into a hate crime\n\nBehind all of this is a simple issue: What crimes qualify as hate crimes in the first place?\n\nThe answer varies by state. The federal government has a hate crime law that bans crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, but some places don’t have such laws at the state level. That presents a major challenge: While the federal government will take on some of these cases, it doesn’t have the resources to enforce its law against all hate crimes nationwide — so a gap in state laws means some hate crimes will go unpunished.\n\nIf a state does have a hate crime law or federal law enforcement gets involved in a case, the important thing here is that someone must commit an actual crime to be charged with a hate crime. That crime can then be elevated to a hate crime if there’s enough evidence to suggest that the motive for the act was hate. But if no crime was committed in the course of someone doing something hateful, it’s a hateful act, but not a hate crime.\n\n“It could be an act of trespassing or vandalism. It could be a violent crime, like rape or murder,” Jack Levin, an expert on hate crimes at Northeastern University, previously told me. “But when the motive involves targeting someone because of a difference, then it becomes a hate crime.”\n\nAn example: A man walks into a lesbian bar and attacks one of the women there. This attack would be considered assault and battery, maybe even attempted murder, under the law. \n\nBut would it be a hate crime? For a prosecutor and police officers, there would be several factors to consider before going after the perpetrator on hate crime charges: Did the attacker yell anti-gay or sexist slurs, or otherwise say anything explicitly anti-gay or sexist? Does the attacker have a history, perhaps on social media or in other writings, of homophobia or sexism? Did the attacker purposely target a lesbian bar, or was the location irrelevant to his actions?\n\nInvestigators would piece all of this together, building up evidence to decide if there’s enough to meet standards of proof for a hate crime charge and conviction. There’s no hard rule here, and whether something is deemed a hate crime can vary from officer to officer, prosecutor to prosecutor, judge to judge, or jury to jury. But generally, once there’s a certain threshold of evidence that the attack was motivated by hate, an otherwise run-of-the-mill crime can become a hate crime.\n\nNow, if a man walked by a lesbian bar and simply yelled anti-gay slurs but didn’t attack anyone, that wouldn’t qualify as a hate crime. His speech, as reprehensible as it may be, would be protected by the Constitution. Until he commits an actual crime, his act can’t be additionally prosecuted as a hate crime.\n\n        Daniel Munoz/Getty Images\n\nThe idea, essentially, is to take extraordinary steps against crimes that can go much further than harming individual victims. “If someone assaults me because they want my money, it’s going to affect me, it’s going to affect my wife, it’s going to affect my family,” Toni Bisconti, a University of Akron professor who studies hate crimes, previously told me. “But if someone assaults me because they know I’m gay, then all of a sudden it’s going to affect people that don’t even know me. They have no idea who I am. I’m just the conduit to gay people [in that situation].”\n\nThe focus on motives in these cases can get into some legally and philosophically murky territory: Does focusing so much on what’s in a criminal’s mind allow the government to regulate a person’s free speech and expression?\n\nBisconti acknowledged that such a concern has some merit. Although she said she probably comes down in support of hate crime laws, she acknowledged, “I’m not sure it’s right to legislate someone’s brain.”\n\nJeannine Bell, a scholar on hate crimes at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law, took a different view, arguing that it’s not really about a person’s speech or ideas but the person’s actions. “It’s not just that you dislike people of my background. You’re entirely free to dislike people of my background. It’s not that you tell me that you don’t like me. Again, entirely free to do that,” Bell said. “It’s that you selected me for some sort of criminal action because of my background.”\n\nWhatever one’s view on this debate, the central focus of hate crimes — what elevates them above other crimes — is the criminal’s motive.\n\nThis makes it very difficult to actually prosecute hate crimes. “The problem is not all hate-mongers are stupid,” Levin said. “They may not let you know that they hate the members of a particular group. They may realize that they’re better off not voicing a racial slur or [putting] racist graffiti on a sidewalk or wall of a building.”\n\nFor investigators, this is always going to make it difficult to definitively prove that an act is a hate crime. So while they might be able to land a conviction for, say, assault in the example of a man attacking a lesbian bar, they may not be able to get convictions for a hate crime.\n\nHate crime laws probably don’t deter crime, but they can still be valuable\n\nOf course, none of this matters much if hate crime laws are ineffective. So I posed a question to experts: Do hate crime laws actually deter hateful acts?\n\nEvery hate crime expert I spoke to agreed that hate crime laws probably don’t deter any crimes. And they said there’s no good research settling this question one way or the other.\n\n“I don’t think that perpetrators think about whether they’re going to commit a hate crime, look to see whether there’s a law that can be punished, and then don’t commit the hate crime when they learn it could be punished,” Bell said. “That doesn’t make sense to me.” \n\nBut experts said that it doesn’t matter if hate crime laws actually deter crime.\n\nFor one, hate crime laws do more than just enhance criminal penalties for committing otherwise typical criminal acts. They often devote funds to police departments — so they can, for example, set up an LGBTQ liaison who works closely with the community to ensure they feel safe. They also label these acts as a very specific kind of vile crime, encouraging law enforcement to take the issue more seriously.\n\n“By making it a hate crime, you call attention to it in the minds of police [and] in the minds of prosecutors,” Bell said. She said, for instance, that most hate crimes are low-level — the kinds of crimes that police and prosecutors may not pay attention to. But once these low-level acts are defined as hate crimes, then they get attention.\n\nShutterstock\n\nBisconti agreed: “Hate crime legislation allowed groups that don’t feel safe with police officers to come forward, and for police officers to understand that this really is a group that’s targeted.”\n\nMore broadly, hate crime laws also send societal signals against hate. Hate crimes are, experts said, message crimes against certain groups of people. Hate crime laws act as a countermessage to that bigotry.\n\n“Hate crime laws have important symbolic meaning,” Levin said. “Hate crimes are message crimes — that is, they send a message not only to the primary victim but to every member of this group.” He added, “That’s the kind of message that has to be counteracted. And I think hate crime laws do that. They send a message to two groups: They send it to the perpetrator, informing him that our community will not tolerate his intolerance. And then at the same time, they send a message to potential victims that they are welcome in our community.”\n\nIn fact, to the extent that hate crime laws increase prison sentences, some of the experts I spoke to didn’t see much of the value in the enhanced penalties. \n\nLevin, for one, cited the empirical evidence against expanding prison sentences. The research suggests that severity of punishment doesn’t do much to prevent crime. As the National Institute of Justice concluded in 2016, “Research shows clearly that the chance of being caught is a vastly more effective deterrent than even draconian punishment. … Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate, not reduce, recidivism. Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes.”\n\nIn other words, more certainty of punishment can deter crime, while more severity — through longer prison sentences — can actually make crime worse.\n\nGenerally, though, experts said that hate crime laws serve a purpose even if they don’t do much to actually deter crime — by giving marginalized communities resources to fight back and sending a message to criminals that bigotry isn’t accepted. \n\nAs long as the FBI reports an uptick in hate crimes, those resources will likely be even more appreciated in these communities.\n",

The next step is to take everything you know (what I call an “information monster”) and reduce it to what will most effectively convey your point (what I call a “story rainbow”).\n\nI do this by using a small mental framework to clear my head before I start making slides.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTake a piece of paper and draw lines with a thick pen. It’s important that you use a thick pen because ink from a thick pen takes up space and makes the boxes smaller. This forces you to only write what you need to write. If you don’t use a thick pen, then you have to constrain yourself to only write what you need to write, which takes more discipline.\n\nEach box represents a slide. Still using thick pen, write your presentation in short sentences. This forces simplicity and, most importantly, cohesion. Repeat the key word or theme of your presentation as much as you can tolerate.\n\nHere’s an example of how I filled in the boxes during this exercise for an article on making pointy presentations (the word “pointy” is my key word or theme):\n\nMost presentations don’t make a point\n\nPresentations without points suck\n\nToday, we’re going to learn how to make pointy presentations\n\nHere’s a Balloon Fish (they are pointy)\n\nThis is a Zen way of forcing out all the noise in your head. It helps you to focus on what is most important, it gets you out of your screen, and it gives you loving constraints within which to work (the paper, the boxes, the ink, and having sentences or phrases that connect).\n\nThe Story Rainbow will thank you. The Information Monster will not.\n\nThis article is part of a Quartz series on how to make “pointy” presentations.\n\nMark Pollard is the CEO at Mighty Jungle, a brand strategy agency in New York.\n",

          "description": "Spending more miles and points than you have to doesn’t make sense.  That’s why folks are excited about the new, cheapest way to get to Hawaii from West Coast cities!\n\nNow that Alaska Airlines and Singapore Airlines are partners, you’ll be able to book one-way coach flights on Alaska Airlines to Hawaii from cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle for only 12,000 Singapore Airlines miles!  That’s 500 miles cheaper each way than the previous cheapest method!\n\nAnd even if you don’t collect Singapore Airlines miles, you likely have easy access to them.  Because Singapore Airlines is a transfer partner of all 4 flexible points programs.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines partner award chart for Alaska Airlines flights might be a little confusing at first glance.  But there are some award flights that offer very good value (and a few that do NOT!).\n\nAlaska Airlines Flies to 4 Hawaiian Destinations – Honolulu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island. And Now You Can Use Singapore Airlines Miles to Book Cheap Award Flights!\nI’ll share details of the new Singapore Airlines award chart for Alaska Airlines flights.  And show you where you’ll save miles (and which awards to avoid!).\n\nUsing the Singapore Airlines Award Chart for Alaska Airlines\n\nLink:   Singapore Airlines Partner Award Chart for Alaska Airlines Flights\n\nThe Singapore Airlines award chart for Alaska Airlines flights is different from their award chart for their own flights and with Star Alliance partners.\n\nSingapore Airlines classifies Alaska Airlines destinations into 5 zones:\n\nThe Singapore Airlines Award Chart for Alaska Airlines Is Zone Based, but It’s NOT as Straightforward as It Seems\nAward prices displayed are for one-way flights.  Round-trip flights cost double the number of miles.\n\nNote:   This chart applies to Alaska Airlines flights only (NOT Virgin America).\n\nYou’ll See One-Way Award Pricing for Coach and First Class Alaska Airlines Award Tickets on the Singapore Airlines Award Chart\nBut finding the number of miles you’ll need for an award flight is NOT as simple as finding the price between the zones of your departure and arrival airports.  Because Singapore Airlines does NOT allow transfers (connections) or stopovers on Alaska Airlines awards.\n\nSo, similar to using British Airways Avios points, award prices are for single segments.\n\nThe best deals are on non-stop flights.  That’s because Singapore Airlines charges extra miles for connecting flights.  So first check if your home airport has non-stop flights on Alaska Airlines.\n\nNote:   You can check using Google Flights.\n\nFor example, a one-way, non-stop award ticket from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles (Zone 4 to Zone 1) would cost 12,000 Singapore Airlines miles.  But a ticket from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles via Seattle or Portland would cost 19,500 Singapore Airlines miles (12,000 miles for Zone 4 to Zone 1, plus 7,500 miles for Zone 1 to Zone 1).  That’s not a good deal!\n\nBecause of this pricing method, there are gaps in the award chart.  These are between zones where NO non-stop Alaska Airlines flights exist, like from the East Coast (Zone 4) to Hawaii or Alaska (Zone 5).  These routes require a connection.\n\nAward Chart Sweet Spots\n\nBecause each segment is priced separately, using Singapore Airlines miles for Alaska Airlines flights is generally only a good deal if you’re flying a route that doesn’t require a connection. \n\nHere are some of the best bargains (all prices one-way in coach):\n\n1.   Flights to Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Mexico for 12,000 Singapore Airlines miles:\n\nWest Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) to Hawaii (this is the new cheapest way to get from the West Coast to Hawaii of any airline)\n\nFly Non-Stop on Alaska Airlines to Honolulu for 12,000 Singapore Airlines Miles One-Way in Coach and Visit Waikiki Beach …… Or to Kahului, Maui, Where You Can Take in the Sunrise From the Summit at Haleakala National Park for the Same Price …… Or Fly to Lihue, Kauai, Known As the Garden Island for Its Lush Vegetation and Gorgeous Landscapes …… Or Even Fly to Kona, on the Big Island, and Visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\n\nLos Angeles to Havana, Cuba\n\nLos Angeles to Havana Is Also Just 12,000 Singapore Airlines Miles One-Way in Coach. Emily Had an Incredible Time There When She Visited Cuba With Her Friends!\n\nLos Angeles to San Jose, Costa Rica\n\nVisit Central America for Super Cheap When You Book Alaska Airlines Award Flights With Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nSeattle to Cancun (one of Alaska Airlines’ longest routes!) … these flights can cost $600+!  This is a perfect example of when booking an award flight can get you tremendous value.  For example, 12,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points are worth $120 in cash back or a little more when you book through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal.  But transfer them to Singapore Airlines for this Alaska Airlines award flight and you’re getting at least 5X the value!\n\nBring a Book! Seasonal Non-Stop Flights Between Seattle and Cancun Clock in at 6+ Hours One-Way\n\nLos Angeles to 8 cities in Mexico\n\nSave Big on a Mexican Getaway When You Fly From Los Angeles Using Singapore Airlines Miles for Alaska Airlines Award Flights\n\nSan Francisco or San Diego to Mexico City\n\nFolks in San Diego and San Francisco Can Visit Mexico City for Cheap, Too\nTo compare, Alaska Airlines charges 17,500 Alaska Airlines miles for the same flights.\n\nFly to Havana From Los Angeles on Alaska Airlines for Just 12,000 Singapore Airlines Miles Each Way\nThat said, on some of these routes (like Los Angeles to Mexico) you’ll spend less using British Airways Avios points for the same flights.  Because their award chart is distance-based, so shorter routes cost fewer points.  For example, you’d pay just 7,500 British Airways Avios points for a one-way coach flight between Los Angeles and Los Cabos, Mexico.\n\nAnd keep in mind, you’ll usually pay far more on these routes using American Airlines, Delta, or United Airlines miles.\n\n2.   Cheap Award Flights Within the Continental US and to Alaska\n\nYou can also find good deals on these routes:\n\nWest Coast to the Midwest for 9,500 Singapore Airlines miles (this would be 12,500 miles in many programs)\n\nJust a Small Sampling of the Routes You Can Fly Between the West Coast and Midwest on Alaska Airlines for Just 9,500 Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nNon-Coastal Western states to Alaska for 11,500 Singapore Airlines miles on some routes including Las Vegas to Anchorage (Alaska Airlines charges 12,500 miles, American Airlines 15,000 miles, and United Airlines 17,500 miles)\n\nFlights Between Anchorage and Las Vegas or Phoenix Are Cheaper Using Singapore Airlines Miles for Alaska Airlines Award Flights Than Other Airlines Charge\nMost other routes tend to be about the same price or only slightly cheaper than using Alaska Airlines miles.\n\nAward Flights to Avoid\n\nThis new award chart isn’t all good!  There are definitely a handful of redemptions you want to avoid:\n\nFirst Class award prices aren’t that great – more than double the price of coach for shorter routes, and more than triple for longer routes – like 89,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip from California to Hawaii (no thanks!).  To compare, you could spend 80,000 Alaska Airlines miles for the same flights.  \n\nLike using British Airways Avios points, flights with connections will dramatically increase the price, in most cases making it no longer worth it\n\nFlights within Alaska are much more expensive than using Alaska Airlines miles or British Airways Avios points\n\nAlways Compare to the Price of a Paid Ticket\n\nIf you can find cheap paid fares, it may not be worth using miles.  Especially because taxes and fees can be fairly significant on international flights.\n\nFor example, I found a flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City for ~$140, and ~$56 of that is taxes and fees (some of which you’ll still pay on an award ticket).  So you’d be spending 12,000 Singapore Airlines miles to save just over $100.  That’s not worth it.\n\nLikewise, flights within California are often under $100 round-trip, in which case you’re better off buying a ticket than redeeming 7,500 Singapore Airlines miles for that flight.  On the other hand, when prices are high, this could be a good deal.\n\nThis Flight Regularly Costs Under $200, so Redeeming 12,000 Singapore Airlines Miles Is Generally NOT Worth It – Especially Because You’ll Pay International Taxes and Fees Regardless\nAlthough the Singapore Airlines chart is in many cases slightly cheaper than using British Airways Avios points to book Alaska Airlines flights, it’s also much more common to see transfer bonuses to British Airways.  Always do the math for your situation!\n\nEarn More Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nSingapore Airlines miles are super easy to earn, because they’re a transfer partner of all 4 main flexible points programs:\n\nAMEX Membership Rewards\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards\n\nCiti ThankYou\n\nStarwood Preferred Guest\n\nSo even if you don’t think you have Singapore Airlines miles, if you collect points in any of the above programs, you can transfer them to Singapore Airlines!\n\nThis makes Alaska Airlines award flights far more accessible than they were in the past!\n\nYou can also earn Singapore Airlines miles from flying.  They’re part of the Star Alliance, so you can credit paid flights any Star Alliance member (like United Airlines) to Singapore Airlines.  As well as flights on Alaska Airlines or JetBlue.\n\nHow to Book Alaska Airlines Flights With Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nYou can NOT search for partner flights on the Singapore Airlines website.\n\nSo the easiest way to check for available Alaska Airlines award flights is through the American Airlines website.  Any Alaska Airlines flight that appears on aa.com should be available to book with Singapore Airlines miles.\n\n \n\nThis Alaska Airlines Flight Is Available for Booking With American Airlines Miles, so It Should Be Available to Other Partners Like Singapore Airlines\nYou can also search on the Alaska Airlines website, but be aware that it will show you higher-priced awards that aren’t available to partners.\n\nOnce you’ve found the flights you want, call Singapore Airlines at 800-742-3333 to book over the phone.\n\nNote:   Singapore Airlines still does NOT have Alaska Airlines flights loaded into their system.  So they couldn’t verify the taxes and fees on these tickets.  But I suspect they’ll be similar to what other airlines charge for domestic (~$6 each way) and international routes.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUsing Singapore Airlines miles to book Alaska Airlines award flights can be an excellent deal on certain routes, like the West Coast to Hawaii for 12,000 Singapore Airlines miles one-way in coach!\n\nBut the good deals are limited to non-stop Alaska Airlines flights only, because connecting flights are priced as 2 separate segments.  And flights in First Class are often much more expensive than booking with other miles.\n\nThat said, it’s easy to earn Singapore Airlines miles, because they’re a partner of all 4 transferable points programs.  So if you’re in a city with lots of non-stop Alaska Airlines flights, this could be an excellent way to save miles.\n\nAlaska Airlines flights still haven’t been loaded into Singapore Airlines’ system, but once they are you can call to book.\n\nWould you consider using Singapore Airlines miles for Alaska Airlines award flights?\n",

          "description": "It’s hard to measure water from a fire hose while it’s hitting you in the face. In a sense, that’s the challenge of analyzing streaming data, which comes at us in a torrent and never lets up. If you’re on Twitter watching tweets go by, you might like to declare a brief pause, so you can figure out what’s trending. That’s not feasible, though, so instead you need to find a way to tally hashtags on the fly.\n\nQuanta Magazine\n\nAbout\n\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.\n\nComputer programs that perform these kinds of on-the-go calculations are called streaming algorithms. Because data comes at them continuously, and in such volume, they try to record the essence of what they’ve seen while strategically forgetting the rest. For more than 30 years computer scientists have worked to build a better streaming algorithm. Last fall a team of researchers invented one that is just about perfect.\n\n“We developed a new algorithm that is simultaneously the best” on every performance dimension, said Jelani Nelson, a computer scientist at Harvard University and a co-author of the work with Kasper Green Larsen of Aarhus University in Denmark, Huy Nguyen of Northeastern University and Mikkel Thorup of the University of Copenhagen.\n\nThis best-in-class streaming algorithm works by remembering just enough of what it’s seen to tell you what it’s seen most frequently. It suggests that compromises that seemed intrinsic to the analysis of streaming data are not actually necessary. It also points the way forward to a new era of strategic forgetting.\n\nTrend Spotting\n\nStreaming algorithms are helpful in any situation where you’re monitoring a database that’s being updated continuously. This could be AT&T keeping tabs on data packets or Google charting the never-ending flow of search queries. In these situations it’s useful, even necessary, to have a method for answering real-time questions about the data without re-examining or even remembering every piece of data you’ve ever seen.\n\nHere’s a simple example. Imagine you have a continuous stream of numbers and you want to know the sum of all the numbers you’ve seen so far. In this case it’s obvious that instead of remembering every number, you can get by with remembering just one: the running sum.\n\nThe challenge gets harder, though, when the questions you want to ask about your data get more complicated. Imagine that instead of calculating the sum, you want to be able to answer the following question: Which numbers have appeared most frequently? It’s less obvious what kind of shortcut you could use to keep an answer at the ready.\n\nThis particular puzzle is known as the “frequent items” or “heavy hitters” problem. The first algorithm to solve it was developed in the early 1980s by David Gries of Cornell University and Jayadev Misra of the University of Texas, Austin. Their program was effective in a number of ways, but it couldn’t handle what’s called “change detection.” It could tell you the most frequently searched terms, but not which terms are trending. In Google’s case, it could identify “Wikipedia” as an ever-popular search term, but it couldn’t find the spike in searches that accompany a major event such as Hurricane Irma.\n\nJelani Nelson, a theoretical computer scientist at Harvard University, co-developed the new algorithm.\n\nYaphet Teklu\n\n“It’s a coding problem—you’re encoding information down to compact summary and trying to extract information that lets you recover what was put in initially,” said Graham Cormode, a computer scientist at the University of Warwick.\n\nOver the next 30-plus years, Cormode and other computer scientists improved Gries and Misra’s algorithm. Some of the new algorithms were able to detect trending terms, for example, while others were able to work with a more fine-grained definition of what it means for a term to be frequent. All those algorithms made trade-offs, like sacrificing speed for accuracy or memory consumption for reliability.\n\nMost of these efforts relied on an index. Imagine, for example, you are trying to identify frequent search terms. One way to do it would be to assign a number to every word in the English language and then pair that number with a second number that keeps track of how many times that word has been searched. Maybe “aardvark” gets indexed as word number 17 and appears in your database as (17, 9), meaning word number 17 has been searched nine times. This approach comes closer to putting the most frequent items at your fingertips, since at any given moment, you know exactly how many times each word has been searched.\n\nStill, it has drawbacks—namely that it takes a lot of time for an algorithm to comb through the hundreds of thousands of words in the English language.\n\nBut what if there were only 100 words in the dictionary? Then “looping over every word in the dictionary wouldn’t take that long,” Nelson said.\n\nAlas, the number of words in the dictionary is what it is. Unless, as the authors of the new algorithm discovered, you can break the big dictionary into smaller dictionaries and find a clever way to put it back together.\n\nSmall Data\n\nSmall numbers are easier to keep track of than big numbers.\n\nImagine, for example, that you’re monitoring a stream of numbers between zero and 50,000,000 (a task similar to logging internet users by their IP addresses). You could keep track of the numbers using a 50,000,000-term index, but it’s hard to work with an index that size. A better way is to think of each eight-digit number as four two-digit numbers linked together.\n\nSay you see the number 12,345,678. One memory-efficient way to remember it is to break it into four two-digit blocks: 12, 34, 56, 78. Then you can send each block to a sub-algorithm that calculates item frequencies: 12 goes to copy one of the algorithm, 34 goes to copy two, 56 goes to copy three, and 78 goes to copy four.\n\nEach sub-algorithm maintains its own index of what it’s seen, but since each version never sees anything bigger than a two-digit number, each index only runs from 0 to 99.\n\nAn important feature of this splitting is that if the big number—12,345,678—appears frequently in your overall data stream, so will its two-digit components. When you ask each sub-algorithm to identify the numbers it has seen the most, copy one will spit out 12, copy two will spit out 34, and so on. You’ll be able to find the most frequent members of a huge list just by looking for the frequent items in four much shorter lists.\n\nLucy Reading-Ikkanda/Quanta Magazine\n\n“Instead of spending 50 million units of time looping over the entire universe, you only have four algorithms spending 100 units of time,” Nelson said.\n\nThe main problem with this divide-and-conquer strategy is that while it’s easy to split a big number into small numbers, the reverse is trickier—it’s hard to fish out the right small numbers to recombine to give you the right big number.\n\nImagine, for example, that your data stream frequently includes two numbers that have some digits in common: 12,345,678 and 12,999,999. Both start with 12. Your algorithm splits each number into four smaller numbers, then sends each to a sub-algorithm. Later, you ask each sub-algorithm, “Which numbers have you seen most frequently?” Copy one is going to say, “I’ve seen a lot of the number 12.” An algorithm that’s trying to identify which eight-digit numbers it’s seen most frequently can’t tell if all these 12s belong to one eight-digit number or, as in this case, to two different numbers.\n\n“The challenge is to figure out which two-digit blocks to concatenate with which other two-digit blocks,” Nelson said.\n\nThe authors of the new work solve this dilemma by packaging each two-digit block with a little tag that doesn’t take up much memory but still allows the algorithm to put the two-digit pieces back together in the right way.\n\nTo see one simple approach to how the tagging might work, start with 12,345,678 and split it into two-digit blocks. But this time, before you send each block to its respective sub-algorithm, package the block with a pair of unique identifying numbers that can be used to put the blocks back together. The first of these tags serves as the block’s name, the second as a link. In this way, 12,345,678 becomes:\n\n12, 0, 1 / 34, 1, 2 / 56, 2, 3 / 78, 3, 4\n\nHere the number 12 has the name “0” and gets linked to the number named “1.” The number 34 has the name “1” and gets linked to the number named “2.” And so on.\n\nNow when the sub-algorithms return the two-digit blocks they’ve seen most frequently, 12 goes looking for a number tagged with “1” and finds 34, then 34 goes looking for a number tagged with “2” and finds 56, and 56 goes looking for a number tagged with “3” and finds 78.\n\nIn this way, you can think of the two-digit blocks as links in a chain, with the links held together by these extra tagging numbers.\n\nThe problem with chains, of course, is that they’re only as strong as their weakest link. And these chains are almost guaranteed to break.\n\nBuilding Blocks\n\nNo algorithm works perfectly every time you run it—even the best ones misfire some small percentage of the time. In the example we’ve been using, a misfire could mean that the second two-digit block, 34, gets assigned an incorrect tag, and as a result, when it goes looking for the block it’s supposed to be joined to, it doesn’t have the information it needs to find 56. And once one link in the chain fails, the entire effort falls apart.\n\nMikkel Thorup, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen, helped develop an error-resistant way of remembering data.\n\nTo avoid this problem, the researchers use what’s called an “expander graph.” In an expander graph, each two-digit block forms a point. Points get connected by lines (according to the tagging process described above) to form a cluster. The important feature of an expander graph is that instead of merely connecting each point with its adjoining blocks, you connect each two-digit block with multiple other blocks. For example, with 12,345,678, you connect 12 with 34 but also with 56, so that you can still tell that 12 and 56 belong in the same number even if the link between 12 and 34 fails.\n\nAn expander graph doesn’t always come out perfectly. Sometimes it’ll fail to link two blocks that should be linked. Or it’ll link two blocks that don’t belong together. To counteract this tendency, the researchers developed the final step of their algorithm: a “cluster-preserving” sub-algorithm that can survey an expander graph and accurately determine which points are meant to be clustered together and which aren’t, even when some lines are missing and false ones have been added.\n\n“This guarantees I can recover something that looks like the original clusters,” Thorup said.\n\nAnd while Twitter isn’t going to plug in the expander sketch tomorrow, the techniques underlying it are applicable to a far wider range of computer science problems than tallying tweets. The algorithm also proves that certain sacrifices that previously seemed necessary to answer the frequent-items problem don’t need to be made. Previous algorithms always gave up something — they were accurate but memory-intensive, or fast but unable to determine which frequent items were trending. This new work shows that given the right way of encoding a lot of information, you can end up with the best of all possible worlds: You can store your frequent items and recall them, too.\n\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.\n",

          "description": "The National Park Service announced a proposal on Tuesday to increase the admission prices for 17 national parks during their busiest five months of the year.\n\nEntrance fees during peak season, which varies but is May 1 to September 30 for most parks, would rise to $70 per private, commercial vehicles, $50 per motorcycles and $30 per person on bike or foot. The increase would be nearly three times the current rate for some parks. Entry and fee adjustments for commercial tour operators have also been proposed. The NPS would offer a park-specific annual pass for any of the 17 parks for $75.\n\nOne price that won’t change? The $80 annual America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass, which allows access to all national parks and more than 1,000 other federal recreation areas for one year. (It’s a terrific deal, and you can purchase one here.)\n\nThe reason for the potential increase to the regular entrance fee, according to NPS, is to address a backlog of park maintenance, including “roads, bridges, campgrounds, waterlines, bathrooms, and other visitor services.” The number of people visiting national parks is at an all-time high, which isn’t helping the maintenance situation. The entire park system saw a record 330 million visitors in 2016.\n\nSome of the most visited parks, including Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks, are targeted for the proposed fee increases. In many parks, a single entrance fee grants access for seven days, while other parks have options for one day or seven day passes.\n\n Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPark lovers seem to be split on this news. Many are upset by the increase, but others support it. I shared the press release in the public Facebook group for fans of the National Park Service, and the post received more than 41 comments in less than an hour.\n\nKaren W. writes that she’s fine with proposed fees. “It is better then [sic] taking the land away. I love the parks and would much rather spend my money there then Disney or other such place.”\n\nJohn K. points to the skyrocketing number of visitors throughout the parks: “great news might actually be able to get in and see something now.”\n\nOthers aren’t so thrilled. “It's a ploy to reduce visitor numbers, as a prelude to selling off Park resources to corporations for extraction,” says Oliver H.\n\nJenny N. also isn’t totally on board: “I hate that an increased fee means some families or individuals might not be able to see these places because it's too expensive.”\n\n Photo by David Calvert/Getty Images\n\nThe White House proposed cutting the budget of the Interior Department, which NPS is part of, by about 12 percent to $11.6 billion in 2018. One reason for the proposed cuts? An attempt to address the national park system’s roughly $11 billion maintenance backlog.\n\nNPS notes that a majority of national parks will remain free, since only 118 of 417 park sites charge an entrance fee. A public comment period on the proposal for the increase in entrance fees will be open through November 23, 2017.\n",

          "description": "People have done some truly obsessive things—unnecessarily, as it turns out—in the name of creating the perfect Buffalo wing.\n\nMark Bittman’s Minimalist Buffalo Wings\nby Genius Recipes\n\nOur most dedicated wing scientists have not just deep-fried, but twice-baked, steamed then roasted, fried then baked, and brined then poached then fried. We even got in on it with an egg white-baking soda overnight spa treatment before roasting, and, to be fair, they were wildly delicious.\n\nBut in his classic Minimalist way, Mark Bittman waves his hand dismissively at all of it. He doesn’t pamper his wings at all, just sticks them directly under the broiler to frizzle.\n\nThe skin is still fantastically crispy and the insides juicy, in exactly the way that a high-heat blasted roast chicken is. Chicken skin responds well to scorching temperatures, and wing meat appreciates that you just get it over with fast so it doesn’t have a chance to dry out.\n\nSurprisingly, Bittman’s original recipe focuses on the grill, only offering the broiling option as a casual alternative. But that’s where the real genius comes in, especially for those of us who don’t have a grill (or want wings anytime, even in stormy conditions).\n\nMerrill, Food52’s cofounder and my boss, has been talking up the Bittman method for weeks now, so I’ve filled the Genius version of the recipe with her smart tips.\n\nThe key, Merrill taught me, is to broil the wings all the way to a perfectly crispy-brown, which is how she feeds them to her small children, lightly salted but without spicy sauce. Then, you can sauce and broil them briefly again, which fuses in the spice and re-crisps the skin. Merrill goes one step further for extra messy, spicy wings, and tosses them back in the sauce one last time before serving.\n\nYou can stop at any point in this continuum for exactly the spice and mess level you want, or offer a variety to anyone lucky enough to be part of your wing tasting panel. You can even work in some of Bittman's whopping 11 more sauce options, but why would you want to do a thing like that?\n\nMark Bittman’s Minimalist Buffalo Wings\n\nBy Genius Recipes\n\n3 pounds of chicken wings\n\nNeutral oil\n\nSalt & pepper\n\n1/3 cup relatively mild hot sauce, like Frank’s Red Hot\n\n4 tablespoons melted butter\n\n1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or white vinegar\n\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n\nBlue cheese dressing and celery sticks for serving (optional)\n\nView Full Recipe\n\nPhotos by Julia Gartland\n\nGot a genius recipe to share—from a classic cookbook, an online source, or anywhere, really?

          "description": "Walk down a block in Berlin or step into a coffee shop in San Francisco, and you’ll notice one thing immediately: These places are lousy with backpacks. And not just any backpack. Slung across the shoulders of millennials the world over is the trademark brightly-colored Kånken from Fjällräven, embellished with a logo of a curled-up fox. \n\nFjällräven, founded in 1960, originally designed the Kånken backpack for schoolchildren in Sweden. Today it’s ubiquitous among urban creatives in liberal enclaves across the globe, from Hackney to Brooklyn—alongside classics like Patagonia fleeces and Adidas Originals like Superstars and Stan Smiths. (Sales of Adidas Originals increased by 80% in the US in 2016, Bloomberg reports, while Patagonia’s sales rose to $800m in 2016, twice that of 2010, according to The Guardian.) At retailers in the artsy London neighborhood of Shoreditch, a wall of Fjällräven backpacks shares space with a display of iconic American southwest shirts from Pendleton, established in 1863, and the no-nonsense ruggedness of Filson, the 1897 Seattle producer of bags and outerwear with a lifetime guarantee.\n\nThe heritage brands experiencing a resurgence among hipsters tend to share several common traits. They’re classic in appearance, rich in history, and famously durable. In other words, Fjällräven and its ilk feel safe. For millennials, who came of age amidst the global financial crisis of 2008 only to graduate into today’s period of immense political and social turmoil, comfort and stability may seem like the ultimate luxuries. And they’re willing to pay good money for clothes that make them feel secure.\n\nArabella Greenhill, the fashion director of Stylist Magazine, notes that brands that today’s twenty- and thirty-somethings associate with their childhoods—or their parents’ childhoods—are especially appealing. “You had certain brands which made you feel safe,” she says. Greenhill points to how Vetements, the French clothing design collective that’s the hot brand of the moment, embraced fashion nostalgia full on in its Spring/Summer 2017 collection: “Vetements got all these cult and heritage brands, like Dr Martens, Mackintosh, Carhartt and Champion, and brought them to a whole new generation and made them cool.” \n\n “We look to the past as a way of either resisting what’s going on presently, or as a way of anchoring things in a more stable environment.” History shows that people tend to retreat toward classic fashions in times of austerity, war, and political unrest. “Economical or ideological climates definitely influence designers and consumers in the way they interact with fashion,” says Kate Nelson Best, an expert in fashion culture and author of the 2017 book The History of Fashion Journalism. “For example, after the relative freedom of style in the 1920s, the 1930s [during the Great Depression] saw a return to a more conservative style of dressing: long dresses for evening, and suits for daywear. There was a more inward-looking consciousness.”\n\nUrban creatives—typically considered to be edgy when it comes to fashion—are not immune to this effect. A brand like New Balance has always had broad appeal; it wouldn’t have stuck around since 1906 otherwise. What’s noteworthy is that hip millennials in particular are embracing the retro sneakers. This demographic’s love of heritage brands is the opposite of aesthetic innovation; instead, they’re embracing the same labels their parents and grandparents wore. The result of this quest for comfort and familiarity is that young liberals end up gushing over brands that, by virtue of their survival through the decades, are inherently conservative. \n\nWhile present-day fashions are more fragmented than in the past, Nelson Best says the current resurgence of century-old heritage brands like Hunter Boots, Burberry, and Harris Tweed fits the historical pattern of uncertainty triggering fashion nostalgia. This may provide an explanation for why even the most forward-looking seek out the tried and tested during difficult times: “[We] look to the past as a way of either resisting what’s going on presently, or as a way of anchoring things in a more stable environment.”\n\nIndeed, when the future looks uncertain, indulging in nostalgia makes people feel more optimistic, according to a 2013 study from the University of Southampton. Reminiscing about the past helps us feel more socially connected, which in turn increases our self-esteem—and that makes us more hopeful about what will happen to us in the future. If life was good once, after all, it may be good again. This emotional logic “allows individuals to form positive expectations, explore their environment confidently and energetically, and approach novel experiences,” the study’s authors write. \n\n Reminiscing about the past helps us feel more socially connected, which in turn increases our self-esteem. Consumers’ increasing interest in ethically-made, environmentally sustainable purchases has also led them to heritage brands. Birkenstock, which has been making supportive sandals that can last for decades since 1774, continues to produce all its shoes in its native Germany as it resists outsourcing. Levi’s has roots stretching back to 1853 and the gold rush, and is now a pioneer once again as a driving force in the Better Cotton initiative, which works to make global cotton production more sustainable. \n\nThese are the kind of brand stories that appeal to consumers, says Nelson Best. “There’s a sense of authenticity about these [heritage] brands,” she notes. “They’re often known for a specific product which they have been making for a long time, and they have a certain level of expertise. One senses that they have integrity.”\n\nFor the minimalist shopper, the fact that heritage products are so long-lasting is another major draw, as it frees up time and money to focus on matters that have nothing to do with clothes. “It’s done! I don’t need to shop for shoes anymore,” says Luke Abrams, who works in tech in London and is the proud owner of a pair of Iron Ranger boots from Red Wing, the Minnesota company founded in 1905. \n\nAbrams chose his boots-for-life after a year-long study of r/goodyearwelt, a Subreddit dedicated to the golden standard of shoe production that gives the group its name. (Goodyear welt construction means the welt–the strip running along the outer perimeter of the sole–is stitched to the shoe in a particular manner.) Abrams likes the fact that his shoes were standard issue for World War II paratroopers, and approves of their hardy features: Iron Rangers have double leather on the wear points and steel in the sole and toe. The best part, says Abrams, is that they will last decades, if not more: “They’re built so that every single part of the shoe can be replaced.” \n\nThe funny thing about nostalgia, of course, is that the past only seems like a simpler time in retrospect. Heritage brands came about in periods with their own inequalities and struggles. And yet they do offer young people a sense of solace. On the streets of Hackney, young professionals have developed an affection for Barbour jackets. Barbour, founded in 1894, still makes all its waxed classics in South Shields—where it also patches up customers’ coats as they wear and tear over the years. Life may be unpredictable, the urbanites of Hackney seem to be saying, but this coat is a constant.\n\nFollow Jessica on Twitter.

And, if you’ve ever frozen in front of a presentation, as Michael Jackson once sang, “Remember the time.”\n\nYou’re here to do three things:\n\nMake a point\n\nMake people care about your point\n\nAsk for something\n\nWe’ll focus on your point – how to get to it, how to structure it, and how to design it.\n\nFirst: Aim for story rainbows, not information monsters\n\nMany presentations feel like leafing through a collection of index cards in an old library catalog.\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nAgenda, Overview, Objectives, Research, Competitors, Strategy, Metrics.\n\nBullet point\n\nBullet point\n\nBullet point\n\nInformation matters and bullet points have a place. However, you only need to look 2017 in the face to know that you can’t always inform your way to change.\n\nPresentations like this are what I call “Information Monsters”. They are big, long, huge, and overwhelming. One hundred slides and no point makes people want to hide under the bed until you’re gone.\n\n“Story Rainbows,” on the other hand, are presentations that captivate instead of try to subdue. They have a main, just-left-of-center point, and they re-assemble all the information around this main point. “Story Rainbows” travel infinity, whereas “Information Monsters” get stuck on company networks and they lurk there infinity.\n\nSo keep the Story Rainbow in mind as we go through the mechanics of making presentations make a point.\n\nHow to make your point\n\nStart by asking questions: This is a set of questions to keep handy at all times. These questions will help you bridge what your audience asked for (or what you would expect them to ask for) and what you think they need now that you’ve done the research.\n\n \n\nDo a point dump: Take a piece of paper and, as you work through the information, capture key points. Even if you need to use long words in the presentation, try to use short words on paper. This is how I started work on this article.\n\nFind the words: All creative work tends to go through divergent (exploring lots of stuff) and convergent (narrowing and focusing) phases. Having dumped your points on paper, play this game on your brain: think about the one short word that best summarizes your point. Then think of others and mind map them (or list them). Feel for words that don’t seem too obvious and common. For this article, “pointy” is a word I like. I also like puns and dad jokes.\n\nWorkshop titles: You might have farmed a few fine words from the previous exercise. Choose one and then list possible titles. You can do this on paper or take notes on your phone through the day as your sub-conscience kicks in. This is a good time to take a walk. It’s also a time to get your brain into an arm-wrestle—move it back and forth between words, seek less common language, push everything shorter and sharper. You’ll often need to use a mental keyword (“presentation” is the mental keyword in this article) but nudge something less common into it or use a common word in an uncommon way.\n\nThree examples for this article:\n\n How To Make A Presentation (the starting point but not specific enough)\n\n How To Make A Presentation Make A Point (using “make” in concrete and figurative ways)\n\nHow To Make A Pointy Presentation (a shorter and less obvious version of 2.)\n\nYou can settle on a title now or keep a couple alive. The real challenge is re-visiting your Information Monster with your word and title in mind, knowing you’ll have to do three things:\n\n Select the information that fits \n\n Let go of information that does not fit\n\nRe-write your points based on your word and title\n\nThe presentation plan\n\nStories tend to have three acts. As I plan my presentation, I plot them out, like this:\n\nStory: What’s the Single Most Important Thing (S.M.I.T.) you want people to take from this presentation? Here, use your words from before. For this article, I want you to know there are practical ways to make a presentation make more of an impact.\n\nTheatre: What’s a provocative way to bring my point to life? In this TEDx talk (The World Would Be Less Strange If We Stopped Making Strangers Out Of Men), I wanted to talk about how little we know men and how hard it is to be vulnerable. My theatre was two-fold: first, I didn’t use a presentation because I didn’t want to hide, and, second, I wore a shirt that I bought on the way to my grandfather’s funeral, and I ended with a story about being with him when he passed away and what another man said to me at his funeral. \n\nAct I/II/III: When you hear someone say that a good presentation has a beginning, a middle, and an end, this is what they are talking about. It’s borrowed from screenwriting.\n\nAct I tends to start with the regular routine and happens in the “real world,” which is the current status quo. It also tends to start with an Opening Image. Think of this as your hook. How will you poke people in the brain to get them to pay attention? Common business examples include:\n\nA provocative question (“When’s the last time you made a presentation that made a point?”)\n\nA statistic (“Did you know that 99% of presentations don’t make a point?”)\n\nA small moment (“So I was sitting in a room and could see someone’s mouth moving…”) \n\nAct II breaks the routine and happens in the “other world,” the one that is possible with the solution that you’re presenting. It often ends with a Long Dark Night (almost beaten and ruminating, the hero collects herself and returns for Act III). In a business presentation, a Long Dark Night might be a “What If We Don’t Do This?” provocation.\n\nAct III returns to some kind of routine in the “real world.”  It tends to finish with a closing image that is the opposite of the opening image. Writers also call this follow-through—when you mention an idea or anecdote early and then re-frame it later. Two examples for this article:\n\nWe conclude by mimicking Oprah and we say, “Now you get a point. You get a point. You get a point. You get a point. Look under your chairs, the presentation is there.”\n\nInstead of doing an Anthony Robbins and getting everyone to walk on hot coals, we bring in a Balloon Fish and ask everyone to poke it so they can see how pointy it gets (if we did this we could even start with a story about a Balloon Fish)\n\nA fall-back structure for advertising presentations is no more complicated than:\n\n Scene-setting: What We Did and What We Found (research, audience definition, problem definition, competitive analysis)\n\n Rising action: What We’ll Do About It (brand strategy, ideas, manifestos, channels, communications plan)\n\nDenouement: How We’ll Do It And Make It Work (team, process, metrics, budget)\n\nClose: How can you make your point end strong? You may like to summarize the three key things you discussed but don’t then turn to a slide that says, “Thanks.” You can get the group of people to do something, you can finish with a small story, you might play video of an interview you conducted. End, don’t disappear.\n\nKeepsake: What can you leave behind to keep the point alive? A typical leave-behind is a printed, bound version of your presentation. Cool. Swag is also common. Leaving behind a balloon fish aquarium? Now that’s a keepsake. \n\nKeep your point pointy\n\nSlides: If you work with conventional slides, take everything from above and start laying them out. Just keep in mind that you want each slide to work hard (or delete it) and slides work hard when they:\n\nMake a point\n\nProve a point\n\nHelp people understand what to do about the point\n\nThis isn’t dogma but a basic slide layout might look like this:\n\nAnd it might read like this:\n\nHappy Endings\n\nYou are your own work in progress, your own fun fact, your own meeting agenda. All of my points here are just a bunch of ideas and tools. You have your journey to take. You have more control over how you approach a presentation than its outcome. You have more control over how you practice presentation skills than how a presentation is received. It is all an experiment. \n\nBut if you can look into the bathroom mirror of Floor 21 of that downtown building and have a clear, visceral answer to the question “What am I doing here?” then others will want to be Here and wherever Here goes with you.\n\nStay pointy, my friends. We’re all Story Rainbows on the inside.\n\nThis article is part of a Quartz series on how to make “pointy” presentations.\n\nMark Pollard is the CEO at Mighty Jungle, a brand strategy agency in New York. \n",

          "description": "In my spare time recently (which isn’t much), I’ve been reading Side Hustle, the new book from my friend Chris Guillebeau. Because CG is a friend, I’m not sure I can provide an objective review of the book, so I’m not going to try. Instead, I’ll give a brief summary and then share some of my own experiences earning money on the side.\n\nSide Hustle Nation\n\nFundamentally, there are only two ways to improve your financial situation: You can earn more or you can spend less. Most money writers focus on the “spend less” side of the equation. That’s great, but there’s only so much you can cut. Eventually, if you really want to pursue your goals with passion, you’re going to have to earn more. “More income means more options,” Guillebeau writes. “More options mean more freedom.”\n\nFor many folks, a side hustle is a smart way to earn more. A side hustle, Guillebeau says, is “a moneymaking project you start on the side, usually while still working a day job. In other words, it’s a way to create additional income without taking on the risks of going full throttle into the world of working for yourself.”\n\nThe beauty of side hustles is that they can be started with little or no money. They’re most often passion projects, ways for a person to take something they already love and maybe earn a bit of extra cash.\n\nGuillebeau says there are five core steps to starting a side hustle:\n\nBuild an arsenal of ideas. The first step is to brainstorm a list of ways that you could earn money in your spare time. How could you match your skills and resources to a product or service that people would pay for? List as many as you can think of, then weigh the pros and cons of each.\n\nSelect your best idea. You can’t do everything, of course, so you’re going to have to narrow your list to the single best idea — the one that excites you the most. “You’re not making a lifelong decision,” Guillebeau writes. “You’re looking for the right idea at the right time.” After you’ve picked a project, do some research. Learn how other people have done the same thing. Figure out who your ideal customer is. Decide what it is you’re going to sell.\n\nPrepare for liftoff. After you’ve chosen your product or service, it’s time to prepare for launch. Figure out the core logistics issues. Set a price. Create your workflow. Don’t worry about getting everything perfect, but do take the time to master the basics of your business.\n\nLaunch before you’re ready. This is a lesson I’ve had to learn the hard way. There is always more to be done before you start a big project. (Heck, I wasn’t ready to re-launch Get Rich Slowly last Sunday, but I did so anyhow.) When you have your logistics, workflow, and pricing roughly right, then go. Start your hustle.\n\nRegroup and refine. Naturally, not everything will be perfect — especially since you launched before you were ready. As you sell, as you interact with customers, learn from your experience. Enhance what is working, and discard what isn’t. If there are things you can’t handle, ask for help. If a process can be automated, automate it. Adjust pricing, if necessary.\n\nBut the most important ingredient to starting a successful side hustle is action. If you don’t take action, nothing else matters.\n\nObviously, there’s much more to the book than that, but those are the core concepts. If you’ve considered making money with a side project, Side Hustle is a book filled with ideas and info that can help you start earning money in your spare time.\n\nIf you’re less into books and more into podcasts, check out Guillebeau’s daily Side Hustle School, which profiles casual entrepreneurs from all walks of life. (You might also enjoy Nick Loper’s Side Hustle Nation.)\n\nLike Father, Like Son\n\nAs I read the Side Hustle, my mind drifted to my own side hustles, and to those of family and friends.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned many times before, my father was a serial entrepreneur. He was always starting businesses. Even when he worked for other people — selling staples, selling industrial supplies, selling boxes — he had something brewing on the side.\n\nWhen I was very young, for instance, he decided he wanted to get in on the health food craze of the mid-1970s. In his spare time, he built a wheat grinder. After showing his prototype around, he decided to make and sell them to health food stores around Oregon. This side gig blossomed into an actual business, and within a few years Harvest Mills was also building and selling food dehydrators.\n\nLater, after Dad had sold Harvest Mills and returned to sales, he dabbled in lots of other things.\n\nHe sold World’s Finest Chocolate door to door.\n\nHe tried to write and sell accounting software for Apple II computers.\n\nHe tried to grow and sell nursery stock.\n\nNone of these ventures was particularly successful. But eventually he started Custom Box Service, which still supports our family today.\n\nWith a dad like mine, it’s no wonder that I grew up wanting to run businesses of my own. In grade school, I would repackage my duplicate Star Wars and sports cards to sell to other kids in class. When I finished reading my Hardy Boys books, I’d sell those too. My friends and I drew comics to sell in the school store. (True story: Several years before the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created, one of my own comics was about a team of super-hero turtles!)\n\nAs an adult, I pursued side projects too. While working at the box factory, I took computer programming classes. Then I got a job (a couple of jobs, actually) programming at a local college. At one time, I was working three jobs totalling 60+ hours per week! I earned some good money with my side hustles — but I spent it all on stupid stuff. (I hadn’t yet become a money boss, hadn’t discovered how to get rich slowly.)\n\nFrom there, I moved on to computer consulting. I repaired computers for family and friends, and I helped set up their networks. This in turn led to building websites — including this website, Get Rich Slowly.\n\nThat’s right: Get Rich Slowly started as a side hustle. It was a way for me to earn some extra cash, money I could use to dig out of debt.\n\nAnd that’s the thing about side hustles. While most never amount to much, some turn into something bigger. Sometimes a passion project turns into something huge.\n\nSide Gigs Aren’t Always Awesome\n\nAs much as this stuff is in my blood, I don’t want to pretend that side hustles always work out. They don’t.\n\nMy computer consulting gig, for instance, never amounted to much. Sure, I made a few thousand dollars from it, but it took tons of time. The money was never worth my while. And of the many businesses my father started in his spare time, only two ever really made money. (Still, two out of ten isn’t bad, right?)\n\nMore recently, my girlfriend Kim tried a side gig that didn’t turn out. While working her day job as a dental hygienist, she set up an online store during her evenings and weekends. She sold teething necklaces. People liked the necklaces, and she sold several hundred, but ultimately she found she wasn’t making money. She was only breaking even. After two years, she decided to pull the plug. (Kim doesn’t regret the experience; it just wasn’t profitable.)\n\nI know other folks who have tried side hustles with varying degrees of success. I have a friend who makes and sells grapeseed oil. I know several people who dabble in rental properties. I know a woman who designs websites in her spare time. I’ve met several folks who write books and/or articles to make extra money. Some folks earn tons from their projects; others only make enough to keep to barely keep the business going.\n\nUltimately, though, I think side hustles are mostly awesome. Even if they don’t bring in big bucks, they give you experience with entrepreneurship. They teach you to be proactive and self-directed. And many times they do help you to supplement your income.\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever pursued a side hustle? How did it turn out? What would you do differently if you had to do it again? Would you recommend that others start their own side gigs? What advice can you offer?\n\nThe post Side Hustles: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.",

          "description": "Four years ago, I tried to live my entire work life on a Chromebook, and it was a disaster. I couldn’t open Word documents, make Skype calls, message colleagues, or pull off a host of other daily tasks without jumping through hoops and pulling off miracles. This week, I hardly noticed that I hadn’t turned my MacBook Pro on in days while relying on a Chromebook. Times certainly have changed.\n\nChromebooks are unambitious computers, and that’s what makes them genius. Using a laptop that’s just a browser sounds strange, but seeing how most of us spend the vast majority of our PC time in web browsers it’s totally doable. And in the last few years, Google has figured out how to make non-browser tasks lot more manageable on Chromebooks.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy my time with Acer’s latest Chromebook 15 but our relationship became strained. Things were a little laggy at first, but we had a thing going for a while. Then, it suddenly shut down on me. We’ve had trust issues ever since.\n\nA Very Big Book\n\nFor a lot of people, Acer’s Chromebook 15 will seem ludicrously large. To me, the Chromebook 15 feels like coming home. After years on cramped 11- to 13-inch screens, the Chromebook’s wide frame and spacious 1,920 x 1,080-pixel 15.6-inch touch-sensitive display reminds me of my giant old Sony VAIO laptop. It’s wide enough to place two full-size browser windows side by side—a big productivity boon, and watching media is just more fun. And while it’s not the best touchscreen I’ve ever used, it’s just so pleasant to exit an app with my finger.\n\nAcer\n\nAcer has tried to class up the Chromebook 15 with aluminum on the palm rest and top outer shell. Just don’t expect MacBook-level elegance. The specs may say it’s covered in aluminum, but much of the laptop is actually plastic with a fancy, sparkly coating. The half-aluminum/half-plastic look is kind of like wearing a tie with a t-shirt—it doesn’t fool anyone.\n\nAcer Chromebook 15 (2017)\n\n5/10\n\nWired\n\nBiggest Chromebook yet with a sharp 15.6-inch HD screen. Chrome OS has gotten a lot more useful in the last few years. The keyboard is comfy and there are plenty of ports. Battery life can reach 10 hours. It has a touchscreen!\n\nTired\n\nHalf-aluminum body doesn’t feel as nice as you'd think. Pentium processor is underpowered. Android apps are fun, but still limited and buggy. The touchpad rattles and has a stiff click. It completely crashed twice without warning.\n\nHow We Rate\n\n1/10A complete failure in every way\n\n2/10Sad, really\n\n3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution\n\n4/10Downsides outweigh upsides\n\n5/10Recommended with reservations\n\n6/10Solid with some issues\n\n7/10Very good, but not quite great\n\n8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch\n\n9/10Nearly flawless\n\n10/10Metaphysical perfection\n\nOn the Chromebook 15, the keyboard keys rise up from the chassis, like islands in a placid ocean of aluminum. The keys have good travel to them, and bottom out with a nice satisfying click. The white LED backlight isn’t blindingly bright, but provides enough visibility to type at night without issue. Flanking the keyboard are large, relatively clear-sounding stereo speakers.\n\nThis big Chromebook is also big on ports. It comes with a USB-C and USB 3 port on each side, along with a MicroSD slot and headphone jack.\n\nThis brings me to what I hate most about the design: the trackpad. This cheap-feeling touchpad has already developed a small rattle after only a week of use. I tend to use tap-to-click a lot, and I never got used to hearing the touchpad ever-so-slightly shake around. This is the kind of detail that separates this affordable model from classier competitors like the Samsung Chromebook Pro or HP Chromebook 13.\n\nAndroid Apps are Fun but Frustrating\n\nThe Chromebook 15 runs on an Intel processor so weak that Acer doesn’t advertise its model (it’s a Pentium N4200), packs modest storage (32GB), and just enough RAM (4GB). Yet despite the tepid spec sheet, it has one of Chrome OS’s fanciest new features: Google Play Android app support. That means you can install phone and tablet apps on this laptop, in theory adding a plethora of productive possibilities.\n\nIn reality, Google’s got work to do before this ability becomes really usable. I got excited to install the Slack chat app, for example, but was disappointed when I realized it wasn’t resizable—some apps can only be used in a tiny, phone-sized window or don’t display properly in full screen mode. Other apps didn’t have features you’d expect in a typical desktop program—for instance, pasting a Microsoft Excel chart into Outlook proved impossible. Many of the apps lagged and crashed, but it’s still nice to have them.\n\nThere’s a lot of promise in a Chromebook running Android apps, but the “beta” disclaimer on this feature is very important to note. I can’t be totally sure, but I’m pretty convinced that my extensive Android app use was to blame for problems I had while using the Chromebook 15.\n\nNot Ready for Prime Time?\n\nOn a low-power machine like this Acer, momentary freezes and hiccups aren’t uncommon, but on one day that I opened too many tabs, the Chromebook 15 locked up. The screen froze completely, cut to black, and then the machine completely shut off.\n\nI tried everything to turn it back on, but no luck. Five minutes later, it magically sprung back to life. Thinking it was a fluke, I resumed my normal routine like it hadn’t happened. A half hour later, off it went again for ten minutes, before it again came back to life like nothing had happened. I noticed black flickers for the rest of the day.\n\nAcer told me to try eliminating browser extensions and try guest mode. So I did, and stopped using Android apps and it hasn’t happened since. Did I just get unlucky? I don’t know, but I’m hitting the “save draft” button a lot more often now.\n\nCrashes aside, this Chromebook offers a lot for your $400. You get a good 8-10 hours of battery life, a spacious 15.6-inch HD touchscreen, and a comfortable keyboard. But there’s also a lot to be desired, as I found when encountering the rattling trackpad and undercooked Google Play support. With a little more power under the hood and a software update or two, it could turn some heads. But right now, like its half-aluminum case, the Chromebook 15 is more about appearances than performance.\n\nWhen you buy something using the retail links in our product reviews, we earn a small affiliate commission.

          "description": "The program has overwhelming evidence behind it. But that wasn’t enough to save it.\n\n“People will absolutely die as a result.”\n\nThat’s how Chris Abert of the Indiana Recovery Alliance described the consequences of an Indiana county’s decision to stop a needle exchange program, which provides clean syringes to drug users in an effort to stop the spread of infectious blood-borne diseases like HIV and hepatitis.\n\nLawrence County commissioners’ reasoning: morals — and the Bible.\n\n“It was a moral issue with me. I had severe reservations that were going to keep me from approving that motion,” County Commissioner Rodney Fish, who voted against the program, told NBC News. “I did not approach this decision lightly. I gave it a great deal of thought and prayer. My conclusion was that I could not support this program and be true to my principles and my beliefs.”\n\nBefore he cast his vote, Fish quoted the Bible — specifically, 2 Chronicles 7. It says, “If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”\n\nThe empirical evidence, however, is on the needle exchange programs’ side. Abert said that it’s led to a 50 percent decrease in hepatitis C cases in Lawrence County so far this year. And multiple reviews of the evidence by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and others have overwhelmingly supported needle exchanges.\n\nAbert also argued that, if anything, the Bible teaches people to help those in need — exactly what a needle exchange program aims to do. “Christians believe their spiritual life is defined by how well they mirror Christ’s work in their daily lives,” he told me.\n\nBut that didn’t persuade commissioners, and they voted against the program.\n\nIndiana’s troubled history with needle exchanges\n\nThis isn’t the first time needle exchange programs have proven controversial in Indiana.\n\nIn 2015, the southeastern part of the state suffered an HIV epidemic linked to the injection use of Opana, a prescription painkiller that’s been widely misused throughout the opioid crisis. Back then, state lawmakers — including then-Gov. Mike Pence — were opposed to a needle exchange program. It was only after the HIV epidemic worsened that Pence finally relented, allowing a needle exchange program in Scott County and later signing a law that lets counties set up needle exchange programs if they prove they have an epidemic.\n\nBut some counties have been resistant to the concept. NBC News reported that earlier this year, Madison County also shut down a needle exchange program due to pressure from the local prosecutor and Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, who was elected in November and opposes needle exchange programs.\n\nLawrence County was among the several that got permission for a needle exchange program. But this month, the program was halted pending reapproval from county commissioners. The law requires county approval for the program on an annual basis, even though the needle exchange does not use county or state funding.\n\nOn Tuesday, county commissioners voted against the needle exchange program. They heard from some members of the community who were opposed to the program, but Abert said that a drug court judge, academics, and health care providers also testified in favor of it. Ultimately, the commissioners sided with the opposition.\n\n“It came down to morally, they’re breaking the law. I can’t condone that,” County Commissioner Dustin Gabhart said, according to Indiana Public Media. “Yes, it’s a problem. Yes, it needs to be resolved. I could not give them the tools to do it.”\n\nNeedle exchanges save lives. Period.\n\nThe common argument against needle exchange programs, echoed by Indiana officials, is that they enable drug use by providing people with the tools to use drugs. And, they claim, that may lead to more drug use.\n\nThe claims are not borne out by the evidence. A 1998 study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found needle exchange programs generally reduced the spread of HIV without increasing drug use. A 2004 study from the World Health Organization, which analyzed two decades of evidence, produced similar results. A 2016 review of 15 studies by the CDC did as well.\n\nAs one example, the CDC noted that once Washington, DC, was able to implement a needle exchange program, an evaluation “showed a 70 percent decrease in new HIV cases among [injection drug use] and a total of 120 HIV cases averted in two years.”\n\nThis is, frankly, not a remotely controversial topic in the research: Needle exchange programs save lives. Many people are going to find ways to use drugs no matter what, and providing them with clean syringes at least eliminates some of the risk tied to that drug use.\n\nExperts also say needle exchange sites can be crucial for linking people to addiction treatment. For an upcoming story, John Brooklyn, an addiction doctor in Vermont, told me that these programs can be critical for “meeting people where they are.” The idea is simple: Addiction treatment staff can drop by these needle exchange programs and offer their services. People won’t always take up the suggestion, but it helps reinforce that treatment is around and available.\n\nIndiana’s story, though, shows the one thing holding back these successful public health programs: stigma that treats addiction as a moral failure instead of a medical issue.\n\nSo despite the public health evidence, officials will often cite moral objections to needle exchange programs. And more people will die as a result.",

          "description": "Sleep. Work. Play. Rinse and repeat. This is the gist of most people’s daily routine, but the amount of time varies as more responsibilities kick in. Some people spend more time taking care of others in the house, some don’t have a paying job, and of course, the weekday schedule is usually different from the weekend’s.\n\nThe chart below shows a picture of the American daily routine and how it changes for different groups. Each bar represents an activity, and they sort by the time of day that most people are engaged in an activity. Color indicates the percentage of people during a given time frame.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom you get a sense of a schedule.\n\nAs a parent of two, I’m always interested in the balance between work and taking care of kids. So it’s interesting to see “caring for household members” shift up and down when you toggle between male and female. The percentages are always low for males.\n\nOr, if you toggle between employed and unemployed, you see a routine of sleep, work, commute, and relax for the former. You see dark colors in fewer bars. But when you switch to unemployed, the color range looks more sparse and the schedule shifts to the right for later wake-up times.\n\nMaybe the most important thing I learned is that schedule of the male not in the labor force (“not looking” above) on a weekend looks pretty sweet. That’s the dream right there.\n\nA Day in the Life of Americans\n\nI simulated an average day for 1,000 Americans.\n\nNotes\n\nThis is based on 2015 and 2016 data from the American Time Use Survey. I used the IPUMS time use extract builder to download the data, which is much easier than sifting through the government FTP.\n\nI used Python to aggregate the data, R to analyze and play around with the aggregates, and d3.js to visualize here.\n",

          "description": "It feels like nothing is safe from Amazon.\n\nOn Friday (Oct. 13) Bloomberg reported that Amazon was getting into sportswear. The company signed on a vendor that produces clothing for Gap, Uniqlo, and Kohl’s to make private-label athletic wear for Amazon. The news sent a shiver through the market, with shares of athleisure brand Lululemon and sportswear maker Under Armour closing the day at 2.2% and 1.8% down, respectively.\n\nAmazon began to build its business empire by taking on the book industry and, over the last two decades, has expanded to e-commerce, shipping, logistics, cloud storage, and voice-enabled personal assistants (hi, Alexa). Amazon owns a whole collection of secret brands. Meal-kit company Blue Apron convulsed in July when Amazon registered a US trademark for its own “prepared food kits.” Groceries are nervously eyeing its recent $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods. But there are still some businesses Amazon will find difficult to disrupt.\n\nDollar stores\n\nLast month, Morgan Stanley Research surveyed investors at its “Amazon Disruption Symposium,” asking which consumer sectors the survey-takers thought would take the longest for Amazon to “materially disrupt.” The most popular choice was dollar stores.\n\n(Morgan Stanley)\n\nDollar stores cater to people who are extremely price sensitive. Unlike Amazon, which exists almost entirely online as far as consumers are concerned, dollar-store chains do best with a dense network of physical stores. Morgan Stanley calls them a “fill-in shopping destination.”\n\n(Morgan Stanley)\n\nAmazon offers a world of consumer goods in two days or less through its Prime membership, but that still requires an initial purchase of $99 (or $10.99 a month, if you choose a monthly instead of annual subscription). The typical dollar-store customer spends less than $10 in a single trip. Even outside the super-price-sensitive demographic, most shoppers still make decisions based on (1) convenience and (2) value. Dollar stores excel at both.\n\nAuto parts\n\nInvestors also believe auto parts, a $50 billion market, is relatively safe from Amazon. Shares of US auto-parts retailers sank in January on news that Amazon had cut deals with the largest auto-parts makers in the country and was looking at regional distributors. Amazon also now offers same-day delivery on auto parts in 40 major US cities at prices that undercut competitors like O’Reilly and AutoZone.\n\nThat said, auto parts is not really about extreme price sensitivity; it’s business built on the demand for extreme immediacy. Do-it-yourself customers who need to repair their cars might not want to wait around for even a day or two to have a part shipped to them. Amazon also doesn’t have the ties to local dealerships that shoppers often need to make their purchases. Beyond that, traditional auto-parts retailers offer tools and advice from seasoned professionals that customers may find it hard to get from Amazon. “Those are the conversations that you don’t get online,” AutoZone spokesman Ray Pohlman told Automotive News in February.\n\nHome improvement and home furnishings\n\nLike auto parts, home improvement is a business that requires both immediacy and human expertise. Ikea has begun to recognize this: the company recently purchased on-demand services startup TaskRabbit, likely to bolster its delivery and furniture-assembly offerings for US customers. (Prior to the Ikea purchase, the most popular task on TaskRabbit was assembling Ikea furniture.)\n\nAmazon attempted to break into home improvement in late 2014 with Amazon Local Services, a marketplace for contracting service professionals like plumbers and electricians. Amazon renamed the platform Amazon Home Services the following year and launched it more broadly, with normal handyman offerings plus oddities like goat grazing and singing performances. Still, it never really caught on.\n\nAs for home furnishings, Amazon’s challenge will be to overcome people’s desire to see and examine these items up close before purchasing. It’s easy to buy something like toilet paper or a book online, sight unseen. But the curtains that will hang from your living-room window—you’re probably going to want to examine those pretty closely before committing.\n\nThat said, even those buying habits may not last forever. Casper, the online mattress startup, broke the long-standing belief that people would never buy their bed from a website, since they couldn’t test it out like they could in a store. And if Amazon can break into sportswear—something most people like to try on—why not home furnishings too?\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Indian cooking can seem complicated and convoluted to people who aren’t inherently familiar with it; all that grinding of various spice pastes—a dash of this, a smidgen of that. But the truth is that once you get the hang of a few basic spices, Indian cooking is as straightforward as any other cuisine.\n\nStocking a spice cabinet can be a little overwhelming, simply for the reason that there are so many …\n\nRead more Read\n\nThere is, however, a point of caution, and it is this: spices—once packets are opened and freshness seals are ripped away—do not last forever. So if you’ve had turmeric sitting in your kitchen cabinet for months and months, my advice is to throw it away, as you may as well be sprinkling flavorless yellow dust in your food. The maximum time limit for an opened spice packet is one month, which is why I buy my spices in small quantities, and store them in airtight containers. This means purchasing them more frequently, but I get the best out of the spices I buy when I buy only what I need.\n\nSpices don’t last forever, and fresher is better. If you have a few spices you don’t use all that…\n\nRead more Read\n\nIn addition to being fresh, spices need to be dry roasted to release all of their beautiful flavors. Some spices—like cardamom—have to be popped open and then dry roasted in order for them to be effective. Though you may have seen television chefs airily dropping closed cardamom pods or cloves into their food without dry roasting them first, it’s not something you should try at home. In fact, you may as well omit the spices entirely if you’re not going to roast them first. Now that we’ve got those points covered, let’s take a look at some of the most common Indian spices, what they are, and what they’re used for.\n\nCardamom\n\nCardamom is one of the most commonly used spices in Indian cooking, and it is used for both savory as well as sweet dishes, such as ladoos. Buy the green cardamom pods and crush them slightly to pop the pods open before roasting them gently. Their aromatic and slightly citrusy notes work well in baking projects with nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and other, similar spices.\n\nCloves\n\nYou may have noticed that cloves look like little flowers. That’s because they are. Much of the oil is pressed out for clove oil—which you may have heard of if you’ve ever had a toothache—and the flowers are then dried. Slow roasting cloves releases their aroma and oils. Cloves are very spicy and slightly medicinal in taste, but when they are used in moderation in spice mixes and dishes such as biriyani (a fragrant rice dish that has meat and vegetables) they are invaluable.\n\nTurmeric\n\nTurmeric is a root that is indispensable in Indian cooking. It adds a distinctive bright yellow color and a subtle pungent, earthy flavor to everything that it touches, and it can be used fresh or dried. It can be used as part of a cold remedy, and in the Indian kitchen it is added to almost everything—from gravies to curries to sauces. My grandmother never measured anything; she instinctively knew how much of something to use, but you may want to use measuring spoons.\n\nMustard Seeds\n\nMustard seeds are varied—there are black, brown, and yellow mustard seeds—and their use in Indian cooking is also just as varied. In order to release their spicy flavor, mustard seeds must be roasted in oil until they pop. Once they pop—don’t worry, you’ll hear it—they can be added to savory dishes. Mustard oil is widely used in the north and north-east of India for cooking. You can use it to make mustard or pickling liquids, or you can temper the seeds in hot oil before adding it—along with other spices such as turmeric and red chili powder—to cooked vegetables such as potatoes or carrots and beans.\n\nMany of the cooking methods to extract maximum flavor, such as slow roasting or slow cooking, are,…\n\nRead more Read\n\nBlack Peppercorns\n\nBlack peppercorns are the fruits of a flowering vine that are dried, packaged, and sold as a spice. It is a fairly common spice in Indian cuisine although it has a tendency to be on the expensive side. This is because it is very hard to grow, and each peppercorn only contains a single seed. There are also green and white peppercorns which are used in certain dishes such as kara kulambu (spicy gravy), tamarind curry, and rasam (pepper water). Peppercorns have a distinctive heat that you can feel in the back of your throat as you eat, and their spicy, earthy taste means that they can be used in food preparation in place of chilies.\n\nCumin\n\nOne of my favourite spices, cumin is a critical addition to spice mixes. The spicy, almost nutty tasting seeds can be used whole in dishes, or ground to a paste. Its uses are varied and its smoky taste—with slightly bitter undertones—is distinctive. When you dry roast cumin make sure you do it over very low heat and don’t let it burn (it burns easily). Burnt cumin will have to be thrown away and that would be a dreadful waste. Cumin is a vital ingredient in many spice mixes such as curry powder and garam masala.\n\nGinger and Garlic\n\nGinger and garlic are a fairly obvious addition to this list. You can use them fresh, ground to a paste, or in powder form. I prefer them fresh; there is a depth and intensity to freshly ground ginger and garlic that is lacking when they are used in powder form. However, that is a personal preference, and the dried stuff can be used with perfectly fine results.\n\nCinnamon\n\nAlthough I’ve titled this “cinnamon,” Indian cooking actually employs cassia bark, or Chinese cinnamon. It is a bit less intense than the cinnamon you’re used to—which is also called “true cinnamon”—although the sweet, earthy taste is very similar. Cassia can be used whole or ground, and it is used in savory dishes such as Tandoori chicken and aloo gobi as well as sweet dishes such as payasam.\n\nSaffron\n\nI’ve left the most expensive spice to the very end. Saffron is not a common ingredient in everyday dishes; it is a special occasions sort of spice. Saffron’s subtle floral notes elevate any dish that it is added to, and it is often used in fragrant rices as well as in desserts. Saffron is very hard to grow and is hand-picked, making it worth more than its weight than gold. To get the most out of saffron, it is soaked in warm water or warm milk. The soaking liquid is then added to dishes such as saffron chicken, kesari bhat, and rasmalai.\n\nYou don’t necessarily need to run out and buy all of these at once—you may want to test the waters by picking up whatever you need for a given recipe first—but the above options should offer you a solid jumping off point to start experimenting. And if you have questions about anything spice related, please feel free to ask me in the comments!\n",

          "description": "Eating well has always been a marker of success. Our prehistoric ancestors received praise and renown based on the size of gazelle they hauled home, while the 1st century Roman gourmand and nobleman Marcus Apicius fed honeyed wine and figs to his pigs to fatten their livers. To eat well is to live well, or so we’ve thought.\n\nBut the concept of eating and living well is changing—perhaps nowhere more so than in Silicon Valley, where fasting is having a moment.\n\nFormer Evernote CEO Phil Libin is a fasting enthusiast, according to a splashy profile in Wired. So are Daniel Gross, a partner at Y Combinator, and entrepreneur Loic Le Meur, The Guardian reports. Kevin Rose, a co-founder of Digg, launched an app called Zero in December to help biohackers track their calorie-restricting goals. And fasters are also forming their own communities: Under the banner of WeFa.st, a fasting group run by the biohacking company HVMN, there’s a monthly “break fast” meet-up in Silicon Valley, and accompanying Slack and Facebook groups where devotees can swap tips and share stories.\n\nIt’s easy to see how the fasting trend is of a piece with other Silicon Valley obsessions, from productivity hacks to blood transfusions and meal-replacement drinks. Fasting is yet another way that tech types hope to buck the banal realities of human biology. Why eat, sleep, or take a break when you could be disrupting?\n\n In Silicon Valley, self-discipline and self-denial are the new aspirational markers of success. Traditionally, being powerful has meant being able to indulge in life’s pleasures—think of the Wall Street yuppies of the 1980s, snapping up expensive suits and binging on bottle service. But in Silicon Valley, self-discipline and self-denial, rather than abundance, are the new aspirational markers of success.\n\n“In some ways, in Silicon Valley, we’re fighting on an economic and intellectual battlefield,” says Geoffrey Woo, the co-founder and CEO of HVMN, a biohacking technology company backed by Andreessen Horowitz. At HVMN, all 12 employees, including Woo, partake in some form of intermittent fasting (IF for short), although the company does not require them to. “I think there is some sort of warrior or monk ethic that people [in the tech world] at least have some attraction towards. You’re here on a mission, the stakes can be pretty high economically, so how do you create an advantage for yourself?”\n\nThe science of fasting\n\nThe methodologies used for IF range from eating during an eight-hour window to restricting food two days a week, and people’s reasons for doing it range from effective weight loss to boosting cognitive function. For those interested in the latter, IF is not so much a diet as a lifestyle choice. It’s of a piece with tech culture’s faith in biohacking—the practice of manipulating and systematizing your biology to enhance performance.\n\nProponents say that fasting mimics the “feast and famine” cycles of our pre-agricultural ancestors. Research has shown that fasting boosts ketone levels—the acids that our bodies produce when they begin burning fat for energy, instead of carbohydrates. While more research into the effects of fasting on humans is needed, early evidence from human and animal studies suggests that calorie restriction may have positive effects not just for our metabolism, but for our brains and longevity too.\n\n Part of the fascination with fasting in Silicon Valley seems to relate to the idea that it’s a competitive advantage. “Fasting is a challenge to your brain, and we think that your brain reacts by activating adaptive stress responses that help it cope with disease,” Mark Mattson, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, tells the Johns Hopkins Health Review. “From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense your brain should be functioning well when you haven’t been able to obtain food for a while.” In other words, if our ancestors were hungry, their brains responded to that stress by working harder to find food. Why not apply that enhanced brain power to building a company, instead of hunting game?\n\nIndeed, part of the fascination with fasting in Silicon Valley seems to relate to the idea that it’s a competitive advantage. In the last few months, Woo has become a kind of de facto spokesman for biohacking and the IF community. He has a podcast covering topics including human enhancement and entrepreneurship, and his company organizes the aforementioned online and offline community called WeFa.st. He also has more than just a personal health stake in the game—the nootropic supplements that HVMN sells complement the biohacking and IF lifestyle.\n\n “What one has to do to differentiate is the focus on the mind.” Woo says it’s only a matter of time before we see fasting the way we see exercise: as a necessary offset to our sedentary lifestyle and knowledge-economy jobs.\n\n“In Silicon Valley, we’re not just in a culture of food availability, we’re being pushed food— Google gives you three meals a day plus snacks and happy hours as standard,” Woo told me. “I don’t do anything physical for my livelihood anymore. What one has to do to differentiate is the focus on the mind. I think everyone should consider fasting if they are in a context with ample access to nutrition.”\n\nAn obsession with optimizing\n\nThe question of access is an important one. Silicon Valley’s quest for self-improvement has long been tied to monetization. Tech bros don’t just want to create a meditation tool to enrich people’s inner lives; they want to make a bunch of money off it, too. And so, the trend of intermittent fasting isn’t just about giving up food for 16 hours at a stretch; it’s also about the fact that one can afford to make the choice in the first place.\n\nNiketa Kumar is a clinical psychologist based in Silicon Valley who specializes in working with underrepresented populations working in tech, including women and people of color. She sees the tech world’s interest in fasting is a kind of fusion of its interest in relentless self-improvement and worldly ambition.\n\n“I see in tech culture—and broadly in society as well—there is this fascination, sometimes bordering on obsession, with optimizing,” Kumar said. “So many of the problems that many companies in the Valley want to solve for are around these issues of being a little bit better, or more productive, or putting out higher metrics. It doesn’t surprise me that people are turning this on themselves.”\n\n “I see in tech culture that there is this fascination, sometimes bordering on obsession, with optimizing.” But the realities of fasting as a lifestyle aren’t for everyone. Scientists have called for more research to determine whether men and women respond differently to fasting, for example. And as Woo admits, “Women have an additional angle or critique around eating disorders that men don’t have the pressure of.” If Silicon Valley is embracing IF as the supposed key to cognitive advantage (and by extension, financial and professional success), it’s worth noting that there are certain biological realities and social constructs that may prevent some groups from joining in.\n\nThat’s not to say that women in the Valley are eschewing fasting. In the WeFa.st Faceboook group, the gender split is more or less even: 49.1% women, 50.5% men, and 0.4% other. However, an influential female faster in the Valley named Sumaya Kazi—who has lost more than 50 pounds using IF and wrote a guide on Medium that’s earned 300,000 hits and counting—told me that the majority of women she encounters are interested in IF for weight loss, not biohacking their way to a competitive cognitive edge.\n\nThen there’s the obvious facts that in many contexts—indeed, for some of the service workers at tech companies—not eating lunch or dinner would be the very definition of not being successful. If you have to get up at 5 am to take a bus to work, or look after small children, or basically do anything other than drive to work to sit in a knowledge-economy desk job, you’ll probably require food to keep you going. And fasting can be downright expensive. Biochemist Valter Longo sells a $300 kit, featuring kale chips and plenty of tea packets, for people who want to stick to a five-day, extra-low-calorie fast.\n\nMeanwhile, proponents like Libin make fasting sound like a rarified lifestyle, in which globetrotters save their calories for peak culinary experiences. As Wired put it: “If he’s coming through New York, he’ll plan to eat a bagel. If he is in Tokyo, he’ll have ramen and feel good about it.” The underlying message is clear: Ordinary, everyday food is for the plebes.\n\nWoo has thought about the irony of not eating as a marker of success. But he doesn’t see the criticism as a valid reason to stop. He seems earnest in his belief that fasting improves his health, and in a country where obesity is undeniably becoming the norm, he thinks it can do the same for others, too.\n\n“I think it’s kind of a false pedestal to stand on, like ‘Oh you Silicon Valley people are fasting while people are starving,’” Woo said. “What is the counter argument? Keep a standard American diet? To me, the status quo seems broken.”\n\nA matter of choice\n\nLeandra Rouse is a nutritionist and CEO of Le’ola Wellness, a corporate wellness consulting firm that works with tech companies to optimize their food and wellness programs. She notes that the culture around food and wellness in a given company is often set at the top, whether that’s extreme biohacking, group juice cleanses, or having Red Bull and Coca Cola in every conference room.\n\n“In a company setting, if the management is into a given health or wellness philosophy, [employees] do tend to idolize that. One of the companies I work at has a CEO and CFO who are super health-focused and one of them is a major biohacker,” Rouse said. “I think in this particular company, they are idolizing that idea more because they see their boss do it and they want to aspire to be like their boss.”\n\nThis kind of culture-setting concerns Kumar—especially when it’s around something as personal as food.\n\n “I don’t think humans are naturally meant to work in an office 14 hours a day.” “Everyone is welcome to do what they want to do and what works for them,” she says. “But I also think there is something about CEOs in Silicon Valley who have this power and these kinds of followings. I worry about people who think that’s the route of becoming successful and wealthy.”\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing thing about Silicon Valley’s passion for fasting is what it reveals about its deeper values. Traditionally, ascetics across cultures have practiced self-denial—eschewing the pleasures of food and sources of sensual satisfaction—in an effort to become more spiritually enlightened and gain inner peace. Silicon Valley has a kind of religious fervor for the ascetic lifestyle—whether that means living on a drink that tastes like wet cardboard, renouncing material possessions, devoting oneself to meditation, or avoiding the opposite sex. But the end goal here is not inner peace or spirituality. It’s to perfect yourself as much as possible so that you can do more, better, faster work.\n\n“I don’t think humans are naturally meant to work in an office 14 hours a day,” Kumar says of the clients who ask her for advice in optimizing their lives. “And yet there is this whole culture to be superhuman and try to ignore the parts of ourselves that really make us human.” Whether it’s possible to disrupt being human, however—with all the indulgences and vices that entails—remains up for debate.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

          "description": "At least a few times every week, people ask me for advice about how to think about their careers: What’s the best way to get a job I care about? Should I start my own company? How can I build a career I can be proud of?\n\nAs the founder of ReWork, a recruiting firm that is all about meaningful work, I used to have ready-made answers to all these questions. I had a fairly tidy view of how career strategy should work, and I got consistent feedback that the frameworks I used were helpful to people.\n\nBut we started ReWork in 2011. And in the years since then—and especially since 2015, when I left the firm to run recruiting for Hillary Clinton’s campaign—the world of work has gotten more complicated. New technologies have seeped into more and more industries and workplaces, and society is undergoing the turbulence associated with that unfolding.\n\nAt this point, instead of having answers for people who ask me for guidance, mostly I just have more questions for them. I think they’re the right questions, I think they are helpful, and I think that if you sit with them, your answer for how to find meaningful work will slowly start to take shape.\n\nHow do you see your career, relative to your life?\n\nI see a career as the entire dimension of life associated with earning, professional endeavors, and vocation—what you do for work. It’s not the same thing as your life, but for anyone who values the world of work, it’s a major slice of your life, by any measure.\n\nI’m also what we might call a career optimist; I believe that our careers can be vehicles for meaning, personal growth, and community in addition to earnings and wealth. I understand that many people have dry, negative connotations to the word career—perhaps seeing images of drudgery or workaholism—but to me those are just attributes of non-meaningful careers. Meaningful careers are possible, if you put your attention on developing one.\n\nIt’s important to periodically consider the relationship you want with work and the world of careers. There are no right or wrong answers, but if you aren’t clear on this for yourself, it’ll complicate all of your decisions and thinking.\n\nWhat sorts of contributions do you want to be making to the world?\n\nThe best way to start charting your course is by asking yourself, even categorically, about the ways in which you want to contribute to the world. Do you want to help make advances in science? Make beautiful art? Invent new technologies? Help shape your community via public service? Your goal should be to get increasingly specific about the types of things that you want to do.\n\nIf you can’t answer this question, it will be very difficult to make plans that survive the real world, so your first move should be charting some exploratory activities that you think will help you answer it.\n\nI encourage people to think in terms of professional pursuits that they want to undertake, rather than jobs they want to “get.” Pursuits can look different ways. Some examples might be starting a company to solve a specific problem you care about, going on a particular adventure, contributing to society’s body of knowledge on a topic that fascinates you, or working to accomplish something with a team of people you enjoy. By their nature, pursuits are multi-dimensional and involve a combination of learning things, making moves, forming alliances, and being resourceful. They are inherently more nuanced and more robust than “getting” XYZ job.\n\nWhen you decide what kind of contributions you want to make, that should help focus your instinct for what types of organizations to work for or what sorts of projects you want to commit to. Keep track of the places—specific companies, networks, markets—that might be options for you, and make it a habit to meet people who work in those spaces and stay up to speed on their doings. Most importantly, make a list of the things that you want to learn.\n\nWhere can you learn the things you need to learn? Can you get paid to learn them?\n\nGrad school is always one option for learning about a new topic, but I also think it’s usually the worst option. There are almost certainly companies or organizations that will pay you—even if it’s not a full private sector salary—to learn deeply about a topic or industry. These days it is incredibly easy to combine active work responsibilities with a self-styled curriculum of books, articles, podcasts, and online courses.\n\nExcept for the most credentialist industries (law, medicine), I am incredibly skeptical about the value of a graduate education price tag, especially if you have to take a loan out to pay it. Every dollar you spend on education is a dollar you don’t have for buying a house, making investments, or making other moves toward the lifestyle you want. So if you’re going to invest in a multi-six-figure graduate degree, you’d better make sure it’s an investment you need to make to get where you want to go.\n\nThere are other benefits to this way of thinking (“What can I learn here?”) besides avoiding graduate school tuition. When you take a discerning approach to examining job opportunities and start asking thoughtful questions about what you are likely to learn in a given job, you become more likely to get that job, because you’re showing that you’re thoughtful, curious, strategic, and a learner. These are all valuable traits in today’s economy.\n\nCould starting your own company be the best way to do the work that you want to do?\n\nMost people under-appreciate how strategic it can be to start a small firm (not necessarily a go-big-or-go-home startup) focused on a problem that they care about. Running a business isn’t easy, but it’s easier than most people think, and there are a ton of upsides when it comes to learning.\n\nWhen considering the sort of work you want to do, and the pursuits you want to be undertaking, make sure to include starting a company on your list. Even entrepreneurial failures can be great stepping stones in a career, if well-timed.\n\nAre you sure that you’re really seeking “work-life balance”?\n\nUsually what people really want when they bring up work-life balance is freedom: the freedom to choose how and when to work, and the freedom to work on the things they care about. There’s no one way to get that freedom. It’ll look different depending on how you’re earning a living. But odds are that it’s the choice of how to spend your time that you’re seeking, not some specific breakdown of equal hours between “work life” and “personal life.”\n\nIf you realize that you actually want freedom, then it’s important to start defining the dimensions of freedom that matter most to you. Is it the ability to set your own unusual work hours? To work from home? To sometimes work remotely? To design your own projects? As the answers emerge, bring them up with your employer or possible-employers to see which pieces you can put in place.\n\nJust know that dimensions of freedom are unevenly distributed in today’s economy. Degrees of freedom that some firms give everyone, others might reserve for their true all-stars who make them conditional on employment. Keep in mind that almost every employer, if getting enough value [from you, in a given role], will agree to increased degrees of freedom in order to keep getting that value. It’s just a matter of how much value the firm is getting relative to which degrees of freedom you are requesting.\n\nWhat’s your personal strategic practice?\n\nRegardless of your initial game plan, personality, talents, and overall career track, there is no way that you can run an effective career playbook over the long haul without revisiting these basic questions and reflecting on them with the new information that you’ve gathered since the last check-in with yourself. So if you do nothing else, create a specific habit: design a practice of career reflection in which you create the strategic headspace to ask questions that matter. I recommend doing this once every month, but make sure to do it once every quarter at least. Do not wait years in-between these reflections—that will make your learning unnecessarily long.\n\nAs long as you’re asking yourself these questions on a regular basis, you’ll make progress in the great adventure that is your career.\n\nNathaniel Koloc is SVP People at Future Laboratories, an applied research lab focused on inventing new companies, policies, and concepts to improve the quality of modern life in the United States.\n",

          "description": "The return of sweater weather and pumpkin spice means that summer is finally, officially over. Or is it? This fall, instead of packing away those linen shirts and summer whites, consider a trip to Kauai, Hawaii’s Garden Isle, where temperatures linger in the 70’s all year long, even in January.\n\n1. Visit Places From Your Favorite Movies\n\nDo it for the Instagrams. Kauai offers several ways to drop in on real life locations from Hollywood films. From helicopter tours to ATV rides, you can get up close and personal with scenes you’ll instantly recognize from popular movies. Kipu Ranch Adventures offers ATV trips that include not just the grassy fields of Jurassic Park and The Descendants, but views of private beaches and expansive high cliffs as well. Just make sure you’re wearing clothes you don’t mind getting dirty in — there’s nothing more gratifying than hitting a giant mud puddle at full speed — and pack a swimsuit as some tours feature scenic waterfall or swimming stops.\n\n2. Feast on the Island’s Best Poke\n\nFor many years, poke, a raw fish salad, was a Hawaiian delicacy that even locals shrugged at. Enter a new generation of chefs and restauranteurs who upped the ante on toppings and made it the next big thing world-wide. The best part about poke in Kauai is that it remains a local favorite, which means even stellar versions are affordable, if not downright cheap. Head to Makai Sushi — a local favorite tucked in the corner of an unassuming supermarket — for the Gorilla Poke Bowl ($16), which is packed with ahi, salmon, ono, sushi rice and avocado, among other things. You may have to wait in line, but you won’t be disappointed.\n\nIf you ask the friendly locals where they go to eat, chances are they’ll point you to Konohiki Seafood, a small specialty market with a takeout counter. This is one spicy tuna dish you’ll be raving about for day — oh, and  it costs less than $10.\n\n3. Zip Line Superman-Style\n\nThere’s zip lining and then there’s flying like a superhero over lush Hawaiian canyons level zip lining. In May, Outfitters Kauai debuted the Flyline, Hawaii’s longest zip line, measuring more than 3/4 of a mile long. Unlike other zip lines, this one straps users in a prone head first position so you soar like Superman over the tops of the trees. At 50 feet, the launchpad is the tallest in the state and you can expect to reach top speeds between 50 and 60 mph. For the slightly less adventurous, Outfitters Kauai offers a range of more traditional zip line options, like diving via zip line into a natural lava swimming hole. Also of note: the 1800-foot tandem zip line, which allows users to fly upside down and race a buddy.\n\nImage courtesy of Outfitters Kauai.\n4. Get Your Fill of Hawaiian-Style Shave Ice\n\nYou can’t throw a rock in Kauai without hitting an adorable shave ice stand. When everyone on the same island competes to have the best shave ice, the consumer wins. Spend a day hopping from stand to stand, sampling the subtle variations of the cold treat. Head to Tege Tege, a charming food truck perched inside a food truck court just off Kuhio Highway, where the good stuff is made one at a time with a hand-cranked ice machine and topped with organic fresh fruit. It’s not a fast process, so there are typically lines, but the payoff is a delicate, not-overly sweet treat that’s all but designed for social media posts. If you find yourself on the other end of the island, check out Wishing Well Shave Ice, an island staple since 1983. Trust the professionals and opt for the suggested combinations, like the Local, made with strawberry, vanilla, li hing mui syrup and vanilla ice cream. And yes, always get your shave ice with ice cream.\n\n5. See the Island From a New Perspective\n\nEntire sections of the island are only accessible by boat, or for the super-outdoorsy, via a strenuous hike. The Na Pali Coast, on the northwest tip of the island, is defined by impressive sea cliffs — or pali —waterfalls and virgin wilderness. Kauai offers a whole range of boat tours that suit groups as well as individuals. Capt. Andy’s Sailing Adventures offers sunset tours, snorkeling trips and day trips to this part of the island. While no boat tour can guarantee dolphin sightings, friendly pods do tend to make appearances, so get those cameras ready.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite things to do in Kauai?

          "description": "Cloud-based music collaboration and creation platform Splice is expanding its rent-to-own plugin offerings, adding iZotope mixing and mastering tools Ozone 8 and Neutron 2. Splice is the only company offering rent-to-own for plugins, an option it launched last year to help bedroom producers access professional tools, which can cost hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars to purchase outright.\n\nSplice, which started as a cloud service for musicians to share and collaborate on projects made in DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) like Ableton, now also includes a subscription service to a sample library with over 1 million sounds, a store for selling popular plugins like Massive (a Native Instruments synth), a library of free plugins, and a robust online community, offering remix competitions and the ability for users to access other people’s public projects.\n\nOne of the great things about Splice is that everything is either for free or for a very minimal fee, meaning producers have a one-stop shop to back up their files, source samples, and collaborate without draining their wallet. But plugins, the tools used within a DAW to do everything from create sounds to process signals, have remained cost-prohibitive. With steep price tags and only a few companies offering licensing as an alternative to purchasing, many producers either can’t access the plugins they need or want, or resort to using illegal copies.\n\nMany producers either can’t access the plugins they need or want, or resort to using illegal copies\n\nSplice attempted to solve this last year, introducing the market’s first rent-to-own plugin program. It launched with Xfer Records’ Serum, a popular wavetable synth that retails for $189. Through Splice’s program, users get three days to try out the plugin for free, and then pay $9.99 a month to use it until it’s paid in full, at which point the license is turned over. At any point, payments can be stopped and picked up at a later point. Splice’s rent-to-own option proved popular among producers as they could now use very expensive plugins for only a few dollars a month while banking equity. Serum is currently the most-used plugin available on Splice.\n\nNow, over a year later, Splice has expanded rent-to-own for the first time, adding iZotope’s mixing and mastering plugins Ozone 8 and Neutron 2. Ozone 8 retails for $499 and Neutron 2 retails for $249. On Splice’s rent-to-own platform, they’re each $9.99 a month, or can be bundled for $14.99 a month. Given that Splice’s first rent-to-own plugin was a synth and now they’ve added mixing and mastering tools, it looks like the company is working toward a full-range rent-to-own plugin marketplace that covers everything from sound creation to final touches. The company tells The Verge it is “looking forward to adding more plugins to rent-to-own soon.”\n\nA full-range rent-to-own plugin marketplace that covers everything from sound creation to final touches\n\nWhile DAWs come with their own plugins, musicians also purchase high-quality and prestige plugins like Serum separately for the sounds they make, or functions they perform. These can cost hundreds of dollars each (there are a few plugins that can cost as much as a car!), and digital musicians need a handful to perform a variety of actions. This can include actual sound creation (synths) to effects (delay, reverb, etc.) to tools used at the end for mixing and mastering the final sound. This means costs can rack up quickly even if someone’s only buying a few necessary items. As a result, people often download cracked versions that can be buggy. “Currently plugins are by and large released with daunting upfront costs and bad purchase experiences,” Splice co-founder Steve Martocci tells The Verge, “that lead the vast majority of musicians, including some of the biggest stars, to pirate them.”\n\nSome companies that create a variety of plugins have tried to solve these problems by creating subscription software models, the same way Adobe has modeled Creative Cloud, and in ways similar to how general digital media has moved from outright ownership to subscription-based business models. Waves, for example, a company that makes both plugins and hardware, has three subscription tiers for plugins. The lowest, at $9.99 a month, includes 16 plugins, and the highest, at $149 a month, includes over 150.\n\nWhile this solves a need, even Waves’ mid-tier package at $50 can feel a little spendy and most don’t need access to that many high-end plugins as learning each intimately enough to use intuitively takes time. Plus, you’ll never own the plugins. “Musicians don't need 50 plugins they barely use,” says Martocci. “They need the highest-quality plugins — the ones worth investing their time into learning and money into buying, the ones that truly raise the bar for their art.”\n\n“Musicians don't need 50 plugins they barely use. They need the highest-quality plugins.”\n\nThere’s some other bonuses with Splice’s rent-to-own. It’s cheap enough that a musician could shell out $10 to use a plugin for a month and toy around with it. Or, maybe a collaborator temporarily needs a specific plugin in order to work on a project someone else has started. In these ways, the platform’s rent-to-own acts much like a subscription platform: you pay a monthly fee, you get access. But, unlike with a subscription, you’ll eventually own the plugin if you pay into it long enough. If Splice can reach agreements with enough companies to provide a robust rent-to-own market, it would close the loop for it being a one-stop shop for their users, while providing access to (and equity in) tools that were previously cost prohibitive.\n\nVisit Splice to try their rent-to-own plugin program, now offering Serum, Ozone 8, and Neutron 2.\n",

          "description": "Stephen Paddock stockpiled an arsenal of weapons before committing the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history in Las Vegas. The bloodshed and the scope of Paddock’s weaponry, extreme as it may seem, have returned gun control to the forefront of the US national debate.\n\nJust how common is it for Americans to own multiple guns? And who owns them?\n\nHere is a look at the distribution of gun ownership in America:\n\nDo Americans own a lot of guns?\n\nIn both absolute and relative terms, the answer is yes. The US tops the list of countries with the most guns, owning about half the world’s guns while making up only 5% of the world population.\n\nIn relative terms, the US has the highest number of guns per capita. There were an estimated 89 to 100 guns for every 100 Americans in 2013–around one firearm per person.\n\nThe country with the second highest number per capita is Serbia, at 75.6 guns per 100 people.\n\nHow many people own guns in America?\n\nAnswering this requires a more nuanced look at the gun ownership. Only a quarter of Americans own guns, according to numbers from General Social Survey and Gallup in 2013. This means that many American gun owners have more than one gun.\n\nHow many guns does an average American gun owner possess?\n\nThe average American gun owner owns three guns, according to a 2015 survey conducted by Harvard and Northwestern University. More than a half of them own just one or two, whereas 14% of them–7.7 million or 3% of the US population–own anywhere between eight to 140 guns. This 3% of the population owns half of the civilian guns in the US. The police found 47 guns associated with Paddock in three different locations two days after the massacre, which puts him among the 3%.\n\nA note of caution: Gun ownership surveys always contain a degree of inaccuracy. As long as Americans can still legally purchase guns in many states without a permit or license, there doesn’t seem to be a systematic method of tracking the population of US gun owners.\n\n \n\nRead next: Stephen Paddock shared a trait with other mass killers: He abused women\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "The 2017 Nobel Prize in literature went to Kazuo Ishiguro, the Japanese-born English novelist who writes lovely, lyrical books about trauma, repression, and survival.\n\nIshiguro’s novels range from the polished and conventional to the sprawling and incoherent, so if you’re new to his work, trying to get a handle on which book does which can be overwhelming. If you’d like to dip into his oeuvre and aren’t sure where to start, this guide is for you.\n\nBeginner level\n\n Knopf\n\nWe’ll begin with Never Let Me Go — unless you are a science fiction purist, in which case the clone story will only annoy you and you are to head directly to Remains of the Day.\n\nIshiguro has described Never Let Me Go as his most uplifting novel, because it is the only one to feature a wholly sympathetic cast: Kathy H., our narrator, is a thoroughly likable, thoroughly sensible, thoroughly ordinary young girl, which makes what happens to her all the more upsetting. It’s a good place to get your bearings with Ishiguro and figure out how he sees the world.\n\nA word of caution: Do not read Never Let Me Go in public if you do not like to cry in public. “Oh,” you might think, “I’ll be that cool person on the train with my book cover tilted just so, so everyone can see I’m reading a Nobel Prize winner —” No. You will not be the smart person reading an acclaimed work of literature that shows the world you are serious and intelligent; you will be that weirdo sitting on the train sobbing over a book. And then when you remember that Ishiguro calls Never Let Me Go his most uplifting work, you’ll be that weirdo hysterically laugh-crying over a book.\n\nFrom there, move along to Remains of the Day, the second of the two most famous Ishiguros: If you hit just those two, you will still be fully qualified to discuss his works at a cocktail party. Remains of the Day is a little colder than Never Let Me Go, and the main character — an English butler in a manor house around World War II — is much more warped by the world in which he lives than sweet Kathy H. was. This is Ishiguro delving into monstrosities hidden beneath a stiff British upper lip, and while Remains of the Day may or may not make you cry, it will certainly make you shiver.\n\nIntermediate level\n\n Faber & Faber\n\nThe next step in your Ishiguro education is When We Were Orphans. Ishiguro fans sometimes talk about this one as his hidden gem, the dark horse favorite for his best novel. Its form is more deconstructed than either Never Let Me Go or Remains of the Day: It begins as a detective novel, evolves into a family story, and then gestures at turning into a war story without ever quite doing so; you can feel the narrative becoming less coherent as you slowly lose confidence in the narrator’s ability to understand the world. It’s unsettling and sad to read, with all sorts of dark undercurrents.\n\nNext up is Ishiguro’s most recent novel, 2015’s The Buried Giant. This one led to a public spat with Ursula Le Guin, in which Ishiguro fretted that readers might not understand that he was writing a literary novel with fantasy tropes and Le Guin accused him of condescending to those tropes without fully understanding them.\n\nIshiguro is certainly using his fantasy ideas in a heavily allegorical mode: The Buried Giant is a melancholy story built around the idea of a medieval English legend, with a dragon and a curse, and even readers who love it will tell you straightforwardly that it is a cold and misanthropic book that sees the worst in human nature. Ishiguro’s other books tend to be about fallible human beings who are warped by the world in which they live but are still worthy of empathy and love, but The Buried Giant is about how human beings warp the world themselves.\n\nAdvanced\n\nDepending on whom you ask, Ishiguro’s sprawling 1995 novel The Unconsoled — with its elliptical dream logic and refusal to even appear to cohere into a recognizable narrative structure — is either a masterpiece or an incomprehensible wreck. I myself am perfectly willing to believe it a masterpiece if Anita Brookner says it is, but I also have never managed to get past page 275 of 535. You may attempt it with my blessing.\n",

          "description": "In 1979, IBM was putting its stamp on the American landscape. For 20 years, it had been hiring the greats of modernism to erect buildings where scientists and salespeople could work shoulder-to-shoulder commanding the burgeoning computer industry. But that year, one of its new facilities—the Santa Teresa Laboratory, in Silicon Valley—tried an experiment. To ease a logjam at the office mainframe, it installed boxy, green-screened terminals in the homes of five employees, allowing them to work from home.\n\nThe idea of telecommuting was still a novelty. But this little solution seemed effective. By 1983, about 2,000 IBMers were working remotely. The corporation eventually realized that it could save millions by selling its signature buildings and institutionalizing distance work; the number of remote workers ballooned. In 2009, an IBM report boasted that “40 percent of IBM’s some 386,000 employees in 173 countries have no office at all.” More than 58 million square feet of office space had been unloaded, at a gain of nearly $2 billion. IBM, moreover, wanted to help other corporations reap the same officeless efficiencies through its consulting services. Leading by example was good marketing.\n\nThen, in March of this year, came a startling announcement: IBM wanted thousands of its workers back in actual, physical offices again.\n\nThe reaction was generally unsparing. The announcement was depicted, variously, as the desperate move of a company whose revenues had fallen 20 quarters in a row; a veiled method of shedding workers; or an attempt to imitate companies, like Apple and Google, that never embraced remote work in the first place. “If what they’re looking to do is reduce productivity, lose talent, and increase cost, maybe they’re on to something,” says Kate Lister, the president of Global Workplace Analytics, which measures (and champions) working from home.\n\nIBM might have seen this coming. A similarly censorious reaction greeted Yahoo when it reversed its work-from-home policy in 2013. Aetna and Best Buy have taken heat for like-minded moves since. That IBM called back its employees anyway is telling, especially given its history as “a business whose business was how other businesses do business.” Perhaps Big Blue’s decision will prove to be a mere stumble in the long, inevitable march toward remote work for all. But there’s reason to regard the move as a signal, however faint, that telecommuting has reached its high-water mark—and that more is lost in working apart than was first apparent.\n\nHow could this be? According to Gallup, 43 percent of U.S. employees work remotely all or some of the time. As I look to my left, and then to my right, I see two other business-casual-clad men hammering away on their laptops beside me at a Starbucks just outside Chicago. They look productive. Studies back this impression up. Letting Chinese call-center employees work from home boosted their productivity by 13 percent, a Stanford study reported. And, again according to Gallup, remote workers log significantly longer hours than their office-bound counterparts.\n\nAnother batch of studies, however, shows the exact opposite: that proximity boosts productivity. (Don’t send call-center workers home, one such study argues—encourage them to spend more time together in the break room, where they can swap tricks of the trade.) Trying to determine which set of studies to trust is—trust me—a futile exercise. The data tend to talk past each other. But the research starts to make a little more sense if you ask what type of productivity we are talking about.\n\nIf it’s personal productivity—how many sales you close or customer complaints you handle—then the research, on balance, suggests that it’s probably better to let people work where and when they want. For jobs that mainly require interactions with clients (consultant, insurance salesman) or don’t require much interaction at all (columnist), the office has little to offer besides interruption.\n\nBut other types of work hinge on what might be called “collaborative efficiency”—the speed at which a group successfully solves a problem. And distance seems to drag collaborative efficiency down. Why? The short answer is that collaboration requires communication. And the communications technology offering the fastest, cheapest, and highest-bandwidth connection is—for the moment, anyway—still the office.\n\nConsider the extremely tiny office that is the cockpit of a Boeing 727. Three crew members are stuffed in there, wrapped in instrument panels. Comfort-wise, it’s not a great setup. But the forced proximity benefits crew communication, as researchers from UC San Diego and UC Irvine demonstrated in an analysis of one simulated flight—specifically the moments after one crew member diagnoses a fuel leak.\n\nA transcript of the cockpit audio doesn’t reveal much communication at all. The flight engineer reports a “funny situation.” The pilot says “Hmmm.” The co-pilot says “Ohhhh.”\n\nMatch the audio with a video of the cockpit exchange and it’s clear that the pilots don’t need to say much to reach a shared understanding of the problem. That it’s a critical situation is underscored by body language: The flight engineer turns his body to face the others. That the fuel is very low is conveyed by jabbing his index finger at the fuel gauge. And a narrative of the steps he has already taken—no, the needle on the gauge isn’t stuck, and yes, he has already diverted fuel from engine one, to no avail—is enacted through a quick series of gestures at the instrument panel and punctuated by a few short utterances.\n\nIt is a model of collaborative efficiency, taking just 24 seconds. In the email world, the same exchange could easily involve several dozen messages—which, given the rapidly emptying fuel tank, is not ideal.\n\nThis brings us to a point about electronic communications technologies. Notionally, they are cheap and instantaneous, but in terms of person-hours spent using them, they are actually expensive and slow. Email, where everything must literally be spelled out, is probably the worst. The telephone is better. Videoconferencing, which gives you not just inflection but expression, is better still. More-recent tools like the workplace-communication app Slack integrate social cues into written exchanges, leveraging the immediacy of instant-messaging and the informality of emoji, plus the ability to create a channel to bond over last night’s #gameofthrones.\n\nYet all of these technologies have a weakness, which is that we have to choose to use them. And this is where human nature throws a wrench into things. Back in 1977, the MIT professor Thomas J. Allen looked at communication patterns among scientists and engineers and found that the farther apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. At the 30-meter mark, the likelihood of regular communication approached zero.\n\nThe expectation was that information technology would flatten the so-called Allen Curve. But Ben Waber, a visiting scientist at MIT, recently found that it hasn’t. The communications tools that were supposed to erase distance, it turns out, are used largely among people who see one another face-to-face. In one study of software developers, Waber, working alongside researchers from IBM, found that workers in the same office traded an average of 38 communications about each potential trouble spot they confronted, versus roughly eight communications between workers in different locations.\n\nThe power of presence has no simple explanation. It might be a manifestation of the “mere-exposure effect”: We tend to gravitate toward what’s familiar; we like people whose faces we see, even just in passing. Or maybe it’s the specific geometry of such encounters. The cost of getting someone’s attention at the coffee machine is low—you know they’re available, because they’re getting coffee—and if, mid-conversation, you see that the other person has no idea what you’re talking about, you automatically adjust.\n\nWhatever the mechanisms at play, they were successfully distilled into what Judith Olson, a distance-work expert at UC Irvine, calls “radical collocation.” In the late 1990s, Ford Motor let Olson put six teams of six to eight employees into experimental war rooms arranged to maximize team members’ peripheral awareness of what the others were up to. The results were striking: The teams completed their software-development projects in about a third of the time it usually took Ford engineers to complete similar projects. That extreme model is hard to replicate, Olson cautions. It requires everyone to be working on a single project at the same time, which organizational life rarely allows.\n\nBut IBM has clearly absorbed some of these lessons in planning its new workspaces, which many of its approximately 5,000 no-longer-remote workers will inhabit. “It used to be we’d create a shared understanding by sending documents back and forth. It takes forever. They could be hundreds of pages long,” says Rob Purdie, who trains fellow IBMers in Agile, an approach to software development that the company has adopted and is applying to other business functions, like marketing. “Now we ask: ‘How do we use our physical space to get on and stay on the same page?’ ”\n\nThe answer, of course, depends on the nature of the project at hand. But it usually involves a central table, a team of no more than nine people, an outer rim of whiteboards, and an insistence on lightweight forms of communication. If something must be written down, a Post‑it Note is ideal. It can be stuck on a whiteboard and arranged to form a “BVC”—big, visual chart—that lets everyone see the team’s present situation, much like the 727’s instrument panels. Communication is both minimized and maximized.\n\nTalking with Purdie, I began to wonder whether the company was calling its employees back to an old way of working or to a new one—one that didn’t exist in 1979, when business moved at a more stately pace. In those days, IBM could decide what to build, plan how to build it, and count on its customers to accept what it finally built at the end of a months-long process. Today, in the age of the never-ending software update, business is more like a series of emergencies that need to be approached like an airplane’s fuel leak. You diagnose a problem, deliver a quick-and-dirty solution, get feedback, course-correct, and repeat, always with an eye on the changing weather outside.\n\nI asked Purdie whether IBM’s new approach could be accomplished at a distance, using all the new collaborative technology out there. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, it can. But the research says those teams won’t be as productive. You won’t fly.”\n",

          "description": "Since Trump took office, more Americans have been killed by white American men with no connection to Islam than by Muslim terrorists or foreigners. \n \nWhen President Donald Trump signed his since-revised executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, he claimed it was to protect Americans from “radical Islamic terrorists.” \n\n“We don’t want ‘em here,” Trump told reporters at the Pentagon, where he signed the order in January. \n\nBut in the eight months since Trump took office, more Americans have been killed in attacks by white American men with no connection to Islam than by Muslim terrorists or foreigners. \n\nRadical Islamic terrorists inspired or directed by groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda do pose a clear threat to the US. There is no question about that. Before last night’s deadly shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history occurred in June 2016 when an ISIS-inspired man opened fire in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and wounding 53. \n\nAnd ISIS-linked militants have killed or injured dozens of people in countries like England, France, and Canada so far this year, including two women killed in a stabbing attack in Marseille, France, and several people injured in a car-ramming attack in Edmonton, Canada, just this weekend. \n\nBut here at home, the bigger threat has come from a very different kind of attacker, one with no ties to religion generally or Islamist extremism specifically.\n\nHere are just a few of the attacks that have occurred in 2017:\n\nSunday night, a 64-year-old white man from Nevada opened fire on a crowd of more than 22,000 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 and wounding more than 200. \n\nIn August, a 20-year-old white Nazi sympathizer from Ohio sped his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring at least 19 others.\n\nIn June, a 66-year-old white man from Illinois shot at Republican Congress members during an early morning baseball practice, severely wounding several people including Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House of Representatives Majority Whip. \n\nIn March 2017, a 28-year-old white man from Baltimore traveled to New York City with the explicit aim of killing black men. He stabbed 66-year-old Timothy Caughman to death and was charged with terrorism by New York state authorities.\n\nIn May, a 35-year-old white man from Oregon named Jeremy Joseph Christian began harassing Muslim teenagers on a train in Portland, telling them “We need Americans here!” Two men interceded; Christian then stabbed and killed them both.\n\nIn fact, between 2001 and 2015, more Americans were killed by homegrown right-wing extremists than by Islamist terrorists, according to a study by New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, DC. \n\nA June 2017 study by Reveal and the Center for Investigative Reporting found a similar pattern:\n\nEven the “radical Islamic terrorists” are usually US citizens\n\nIn Trump’s very first speech to Congress, he claimed that “the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.”\n\nBut none of the perpetrators of the major US terrorist attacks carried out in the name of Islam in the past 15 years have come from the nations on Trump’s travel ban (either the original one or the new, revised version that was released late last month). In fact, the country home to the biggest number of terrorists who have carried out successful attacks inside the US is the US itself. \n\nThe San Bernardino shooting that killed 14 people was carried out by an American-born US citizen of Pakistani descent and a lawful permanent US resident of Pakistani descent. The Orlando nightclub shooter who murdered 49 people was an American-born US citizen of Afghan descent. The Boston marathon bombers, who identified as ethnic Chechen, came to the US from Kyrgyzstan and grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before carrying out attacks that left three dead. Faisal Shahzad, the attempted Times Square bomber, was Pakistani-American. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009, was born in Virginia to Palestinian parents.\n\nAnd as my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written, the average likelihood of an American being killed in a terrorist attack in which an immigrant participated in any given year is one in 3.6 million — even including the 9/11 deaths. The average American is more likely to die from their own clothing or a toddler with a gun than an immigrant terrorist. But we’re not banning guns and T-shirts from coming into the country.\n\nAdopting extremist views and committing horrendous acts of violence in the name of some \"righteous\" cause, be it religion or politics or just plain old hatred, isn't something that only Muslims, or Arabs, or immigrants, or any other group of people do. It's something humans do.",

          "description": "When designer Bryan Sparks explains the inspiration for the look and feel of the modern Xbox, he says he and his team went back to 1968, when a certain landmark Stanley Kubrick film hit theaters and changed how the world saw science fiction. “We had this vision in our minds of a monolith,” Sparks says, referencing the black, slab-like machine of extraterrestrial origin in 2001: A Space Odyssey. “In the movie, every time you see the monolith, it signifies this point of advancement.”\n\nAn industrial designer by trade, Sparks has long hair and a penchant for t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers in the workplace. Couple that with his tall wiry frame and he looks more like a professional skateboarder than the aesthetic mastermind behind Microsoft’s gaming hardware. The way he sees it, the signature look of last year’s gleaming white Xbox One S spoke to that idea of technological progress. It’s a look that the design team knew they had to keep when they designed the new, much more powerful Xbox One X, even more of a monolith with its matte black finish. Still, what Microsoft didn’t want “was for this to be a big block,” Sparks adds.\n\n“We had this vision in our minds of a monolith.”\n\nWhen discussing how he and his team designed the Xbox One X, Sparks says the process revolved around one pivotal benchmark. The new console had to be compact, more so than any comparable PC. In fact, it would need to be even smaller than the Xbox One S, itself a slim version of the original Xbox One. There was one big issue: the new console wouldn’t just have to be smaller, it also needed to be 40 percent more powerful.\n\nTo tell the story of how its Xbox team accomplished such a feat, Microsoft invited us up to its Redmond, Washington headquarters to give an inside look at the design process behind the Xbox One X. But the company was also willing to go beyond the question of how and into the question of why — why make such a device, and why now?\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nIt’s a familiar arrangement. Since 2013, with the less-than-stellar Xbox One launch, Microsoft has sold the media, and by extension the public, on a message of redemption. Eager to explain its course corrections and transparent in acknowledging where it went wrong, Microsoft executives have in the past laid bare the corporate strategies behind its biggest gambles, like the (now failed) attempt at using the Xbox One as a Trojan horse for the living room and the more recent merging of its Xbox and Windows platforms. Starting in June of 2016, the company has seemingly gone all in on yet another promise: that the next Xbox console might be the last, at least as we think of console hardware generations today.\n\nThe Xbox One X, formerly known as Project Scorpio and arriving November 7th for $499, comes with what sounds like a simple pitch: to create the most powerful game console ever made. But that pitch becomes much more complicated when you take into account the industry the new console will live in. The device is an improvement, but it does not offer the same type of leap consumers saw when gaming jumped from 2D to 3D, from 64 bits to 128 bits, or from standard definition to high definition. Instead, the One X offers 4K gaming at higher frame rates, so long as you have a capable television set and so long as the game you’re playing has been optimized to take advantage of the new horsepower. It will not, as some fans had longingly hoped, play Steam games or run a full version of Windows 10.\n\nXbox One X is the first console in Microsoft’s history to straddle two hardware generations\n\nMore importantly, this new Xbox will be first in the history of Microsoft’s gaming business to straddle the line between an existing generation and a new one. Prior mid-cycle console upgrades have added more storage or sported a new, slimmer design. But the console business has always waited roughly six to seven years before completely starting from scratch with a new chip architecture, inevitably rendering older games unplayable on the new hardware. With the Xbox One X and Sony’s similar PlayStation 4 Pro, both of which are designed to play their entire respective libraries at various levels of fidelity and efficiency, we’re entering uncharted territory.\n\nThe question now is what these mid-cycle upgrades mean for consoles. Do they mark a move away from the current business model, toward something closer resembling the PC? Or are we seeing a more permanent constriction in the upgrade cycle that will turn a game console into something more akin to the smartphone — a device you upgrade wholesale every few years to a newer, faster model that still manages to run most older software?\n\nMicrosoft’s answer? Let’s wait and see.\n\n“I think people misinterpreted some of what we said when we announced Project Scorpio about thinking beyond console generations,” says Albert Penello, Microsoft’s senior director of console marketing. Penello says he doesn’t think console generations, moments that mark big increases in performance, will go away. “I think that will exist in a form that is just different than it is today. Today, the devices are somewhat disposable.” It’s everything else — your games, your circle of friends — that should, in theory, remain constant. That’s a philosophy Microsoft is investing in heavily, with its backwards compatibility and Xbox Play Anywhere initiatives.\n\nYet for the company, even more is on the line with the success of the One X. After Microsoft fumbled the launch of the Xbox One, focusing more on entertainment than core games, Sony’s PlayStation 4 has been outselling it nearly two to one. Microsoft’s new device may be the most powerful console ever made, but if it can’t help close that gap, all that added power could be wasted on a player base that’s increasingly looking to play elsewhere. Then there’s the PC, perhaps the biggest existential threat to the One X, because it already plays most exclusive Xbox games while remaining more powerful than anything Microsoft or Sony produce for the living room.\n\nMicrosoft is willing to talk about the what and the why of the new hardware. But there’s an even more important question: who exactly is the Xbox One X for?\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nOn a cloudless and sunny August day, Microsoft representatives welcome me and a group of other journalists into Building 87 at the company’s Redmond headquarters. The facility is a former on-site records warehouse that has since been converted into a hardware development and prototyping hub. It’s where the Zune MP3 player was designed and developed and where the Surface was first born as a massive tabletop touchscreen display.\n\nBuilding 87 is maze-like, with winding halls and the occasional glass trophy case full of historic Xbox memorabilia. Deeper inside is a cavernous series of rooms containing everything from full-color 3D printers to precision water jet machines to injection mold makers. It’s an industrial designer’s playground and a paradise for the tinkerers and engineers now responsible for both the Xbox and Microsoft’s Surface business.\n\nBuilding 87 is an industrial designer’s playground and a paradise for engineers and tinkerers\n\nIt’s here that Microsoft conceived what would become the Xbox One X, and the Xbox One S before it. We’re standing in what Leo Del Castillo, Microsoft's general manager of Xbox hardware, calls the “campfire,” which is a collection of desks sporting massive computer monitors that sits in the middle of Building 87’s many hardware labs and prototyping stations. Just behind us is a wall of glass separating the workstations from numerous rows of gigantic machines capable of turning a virtual CAD file into a physical object in a matter of hours, a process that used to take Microsoft weeks when it was still known exclusively as a software maker.\n\n“What ends up looking like a very clean design requires very, very complex tooling and manufacturing processes,” explains Del Castillo, who’s been a Microsoft employee for more than 22 years and was part of the team formed back in 1999 to develop the original Xbox. With a finely trimmed goatee and an engineer’s precision when he speaks about products, Del Castillo is very much the older, more buttoned-up foil to Sparks and his design team. But the two say they play off one another in instrumental ways, with Sparks’ team pushing the envelope to the maximum of what Del Castillo’s group can engineer.\n\n Industrial designer Bryan Sparks, middle, explains the challenges of developing the Xbox One X alongside general manager of hardware Leo Del Castillo, left. Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nThe Scorpio engine, the heart of the new Xbox One X, is an integrated 8-core AMD Jaguar processor, the same architecture as the original Xbox One. That means the new box can still play games developed four years ago, for older and less powerful hardware. Yet it’s that same souped up chip, coupled with a generous extra helping of on-board memory, that makes the One X capable of performing more than four times the number of calculations per second than the original Xbox One.\n\nNone of this should mean all that much to the end consumer, but it does result in a system capable of rendering games at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second — the golden standard by which most high-end gaming experiences are now measured. It’s that standard that Del Castillo and Sparks were tasked with hitting, all while fitting that power bump into a box slimmer than the Xbox One S.\n\nThe team, knowing they already had a hit on their hands with last year’s Xbox redesign, decided to reengineer the entire internal layout of the console to accommodate the new components. It started with Del Castillo and the other engineers’ decision to take the entire motherboard, flip it upside down, and stick to the ceiling of the chassis, freeing up a healthy amount of space on the bottom. “From a design standpoint, moving the motherboard on top means that we wouldn’t need any venting on that top face, which allows us to keep that clean, unbroken monolithic form,” Sparks says. It also meant the device could keep its signature “overhang,” an aesthetic choice of Spark’s design team wherein the top of the chassis is slightly longer than its bottom.\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nFrom there, Del Castillo’s team decided to free up even more space by stacking the Xbox One X’s hard disc drive and optical disc drive on top of one another. This allowed them to retain the integrated power supply of the One S, itself adding only a small increase in size. That meant consumers wouldn’t need one of those hideous, industrial-looking bricks that have plagued previous iterations of the Xbox.\n\nThere was another, more crucial need for all this extra space. While the components that would be giving the Xbox One X its added horsepower were not all that much larger than before, the electrical output definitely would be. “This is the most powerful processor,” Del Castillo says, “and it uses quite a bit of electrical power.\n\n“The whole system is about twice the power of an Xbox One S. Virtually all of that turns into heat.”\n\nThe team couldn’t use the Xbox’s existing cooling rig, which would add too much height given the power requirements of the Scorpio engine. So they decided to use what’s known as a vapor chamber heat sink, which is a cooling mechanism typically reserved for high-end graphics cards and servers. Unlike a standard liquid cooling system, which pumps water through tubes, a vapor chamber uses a minimal amount of deionized water sealed in a vacuum. That drastically lowers the boiling point of the liquid, allowing the system to take advantage of phase changes as the water transforms into gas and back again, moving heat along the way.\n\n“We believe this is the first time this has been used in a consumer electronics product at the kinds of volumes we’ll be using it,” Del Castillo says. “Now you’re moving heat both in the form of changes in temperature and changes in phase. That allows heat to move from these hot components to these radiator fins much more efficiently, with much less temperature drop. That allows this device to be more efficient at converting that heat into the airstream.\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nWhile the new variety of heat sink would control how air moved through the system, the One X still required a more novel way of exhausting it all. Sparks and the design team presented a number of different methods to try and minimize the visible venting patterns, none of which jibed with Del Castillo’s “engineering realities.” So, with the help of Microsoft’s in-house thermal engineering division, based out of Silicon Valley, the design group simulated airflow using a number of different proposed venting patterns and configurations.\n\nThey ultimately decided to miniaturize the circular pinhole-style venting pattern of the One S, but with the perforations only along the sides of the upper house. That resulted in a fine mesh venting pattern that would leave the upper housing’s unibody enclosure completely clean, save the Xbox logo and lettering in the upper left corner.\n\nMicrosoft used the color Infinite Black to contrast with Robot White\n\nTo round it all out, Sparks says the industrial design team turned to color as the finishing touch. The Xbox One S was introduced alongside a new, pristine finish Microsoft called “Robot White.” The One X would have to be different, in a pronounced and declarative fashion. Sparks says black made the most sense. “We looked at lots of different options, lots of different combinations of colors,” Sparks says. “Where we landed was creating our own color we call Infinite Black, which is a really deep, rich, neutral black.” While “Infinite Black” certainly sounds like (and is) marketing hyperbole, the color does have a throwback aesthetic, evoking an earlier era when a new game console’s understated plainness seemed a byproduct of its raw, exciting capabilities.\n\nThis combination of design and engineering innovations, mixed with the aesthetic choices and constraints the team imposed on itself, helped the group achieve their goal of building the most powerful game console ever. But no amount of technical specifications, custom color schemes, or heat sink physics explanations can help the Xbox One X outsell the competition. To do that, Microsoft needs a narrative, one that explains why it made a 4K console in the first place and what it means for the future of games.\n\nThat’s where Phil Spencer comes in.\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\nThe launch of the original Xbox One is a sore moment for Microsoft, something Xbox division head Phil Spencer looks back on with a twisted expression somewhere between remorse and frustration. “The hardware team coming through the launch of the Xbox One took more criticism for certain decisions than they should have,” Spencer tells me, sitting in a conference room at the on-site offices of Forza Motorsport maker Turn 10 Studios. “The hardware team that built [the Xbox One] S and the hardware team that built [the Xbox One] X is the same hardware team. It’s the same individuals that have been on Xbox for a long time.”\n\nSpencer is referencing Microsoft’s gamble to position the Xbox One as an entertainment hub, instead of a game machine, back in 2013. Coupled with a misguided policy shift around requiring the device connect to the internet regularly, Microsoft had kicked a particularly vicious hornets nest in the game community. It also priced the Xbox One $100 more than Sony’s PlayStation 4, because of the bundled second-generation Kinect motion camera. Fans were incensed. Spencer, a 26-year veteran of the company when he took the reins of the Xbox business in 2014, has spent the last three years working to rebuild the brand.\n\nMicrosoft has struggled with big Xbox exclusives these past two years\n\nThat process has involved making both a lot of hard choices and, at times, promises that have proved more empty than full. The Kinect has since been unbundled from the Xbox and sidelined. Spencer, who now answers directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, has made an effort to sell Windows 10 as a companion, and not a competitor, to the Xbox brand. Yet the latter has suffered when it comes to a core selling point of the game console: exclusivity. In a year when Sony has had huge exclusive hit after another — Nier: Automata and Horizon Zero Dawn, to name a couple — Microsoft has struggled to own a big tentpole game release of its own.\n\nReCore and Quantum Break are unlikely to see sequels, while Halo Wars 2 and Gears of War 4 feel like late-stage entries for aging franchises. The company canceled Fable Legends and Scalebound earlier this year. Making matters worse, the Xbox One X won’t have a big game to accompany its launch after the delay of Crackdown 3. Instead, Microsoft is banking on post-release 4K upgrades for Forza Motorsport 7 and Middle-earth: Shadow of War.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Spencer, who turns 50 next year, seems physically incapable of exhibiting stress. His youthful demeanor — punctuated by a stocky build, clean-shaven face, and an unchanging swoop of brown hair — makes him an outlier among the more corporate, suite-and-tie world of gaming’s executive leadership. (He also happens to have an impressive collection of gaming t-shirts he likes to don under unbuttoned blazers.) It’s with that image that Spencer has assumed the role of both the friendly messenger and crafty architect of the back-to-basics philosophy that has guided Xbox’s comeback strategy. For him, it’s been making it all about the games in every conceivable fashion, to scrub the launch of the Xbox One from our collective memory.\n\n“This generation in general has struggled a bit in describing what the transition was about,” Spencer says, referring to the opaque jump from the Xbox 360 and PS3 era. “I always go back to when we launched 360 and the SD to HD transition was happening for people. It was easy to look at it an Xbox 360 and and say, ‘Oh, it’s an HD console.’”\n\nSpencer thinks 4K can be impact in ways the jump to the original Xbox One was not\n\nSpencer thinks 4K can be impactful in ways the jump to the original Xbox One was not. Even though the industry may not technically be exiting one generation and entering a new one, 4K might have the momentum needed to bring consumers onboard, especially if it can make Xbox the more attractive platform to play third-party games in the absence of big-name exclusives. Panello, Xbox’s marketing director, is quick to remind me that half of all TVs sold this year will be 4K ready. “In a few years, it will be 100 percent of TVs,” Panello says. But it’s an open question what 4K gaming means to most players, many of which don’t know what it even looks like or how it compares to what they have today.\n\nSpencer admits that we’re probably never going to see the jumps in progress we saw in earlier generations, when each new piece of hardware delivered exponential increases in computing power and developers were constantly reinventing nearly every single aspect of game design. Take, for instance, the jump from two dimensions to three.\n\n“That was different gameplay that showed up when things went from 2D to 3D,” he says. We’re unlikely to see new gameplay innovations delivered by technological advances — that’s more the job of smart design and novel software implementation these days. But, Spencer adds, “as you get closer to reality, the smaller differences actually matter more in your head.” Because 4K is that much closer to photorealism, he explains, consumers should notice each incremental step toward that end goal of simulating the real world.\n\n Forza Motorsport 7, from Microsoft-owned Turn 10 Studios, will play at 4K / 60 frames per second on Xbox One X. Microsoft is positioning the game as a powerful example of what the new console is capable of. Image: Microsoft\n\nAs for whether that particular number of pixels is enough to sell pricer hardware, Spencer is confident it will matter to the right kind of customer, even if that group starts out as niche. He points to the $150 Xbox Elite controller, which he says had its fair share of critics who claimed it would be asinine to try and sell a luxury good to a mainstream console audience. But then “we couldn’t make enough of them,” he points out. “It doesn’t mean everyone should go in and buy an Elite controller. This [Xbox One X] is an opportunity for somebody who says, ‘You know, I want the absolute best in console games.’”\n\nI bring up the smartphone because it seems like the most apt comparison, especially as Apple gears up to sell the world an $1,000 iPhone also carrying the “X” signifer. Spencer doesn’t think consoles will go the way of smartphones, primarily because the console business model involves selling one device at thin margins and making up the revenue in software sales as the cost of components goes down over time. But Spencer is also hesitant to use the same language he once did when, just a year and half ago, he told an audience at an event in San Francisco that the idea of console generations might disappear in favor of a PC-style model.\n\nMicrosoft was looking at ways to keep pace with graphics cards and smartphones\n\n“We used to say that the average lifespan of a TV was seven years or until the tube broke. Now, people are swapping phones every other year… people are getting more used to churning through devices around them,” Spencer says. “We were looking at our model and saying, ‘Okay, is there a way for us to keep the console as up to date as graphics cards and phones and other things and not have it fall behind.”\n\nWhile Microsoft may not be interested in selling you an Xbox quite as frequently as Apple sells the iPhone, the console business certainly feels as if it’s looking to the smartphone for inspiration. No two aspects of Microsoft’s strategy exemplify that more than Xbox Play Anywhere and backwards compatibility.\n\nXbox Play Anywhere, based on the idea that both the PC and the Xbox run a unified version of Windows 10, ensures that players can take the experience of playing a game with them across screens and hardware types. Backwards compatibility ensures that there’s an ever-increasing library of games that can be played across generations, regardless of the silicon powering the box plugged into your TV. These aren’t new ideas; Microsoft has been harping on them for more than a year now, and it’s still unclear whether they'll truly take off in the way the company hopes. But they still carry the promise of a brighter, more accessible future, one only Microsoft seems intent on shooting for.\n\n Photo by Tyler Pina / The Verge\n\n“I’ve always felt that the demise of a console generation, when it goes away, land locks a bunch of content that is really hard to go play. You don’t have to deal with an iPhone 8 that can’t play things on the iPhone 6,” Spencer says. Just like buying a new smartphone doesn’t mean you no longer have access to Google Maps or Snapchat, Spencer says buying a new game console shouldn’t cut you off from using certain software.\n\nThe far-off answer to that might be game streaming services, where a game is run locally from a server farm somewhere remote and streamed over the internet to your TV. “If you look further out, is that a destination that we’re going to land on, I do think at some point — maybe it’s 20 years, maybe it’s 5 years, I don’t know — but there’s going to be this switch point,” he says, “where people feel like performance fidelity and other things fit in that world. Today, that’s hard with 4K.”\n\n“Price will always be a very important factor in what console a majority of people choose.”\n\nFor now, Spencer is comfortable with the leap Microsoft is taking with the Xbox One X, especially because it gives consumers two price points to consider with meaningful differences. “Price will always be a very important factor in what console a majority of people choose,” he says. “I want to give people choice because to me, gaming is incredibly important. It’s something I do almost every day. That’s not a value judgement on people who say, ‘I like FIFA, I like Madden, I want to go play LEGO Batman with my kids.’ I’m not making a value judgment on their choices, it’s just how gaming fits into their life.”\n\nIf that person were to ask whether they should go buy an Xbox One X, Spencer has a simple answer: no, the One S is probably just fine. “I think the [One] S console is a great entry-level console for people,” Spencer says. The One X, on the other hand, will likely define this generation in terms of power and performance.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a question of whether it’s the most powerful console. People might say, ‘Okay, can I really feel it? Is it going to matter to me?’” Spencer adds. “I can say to me it matters. When I’m at home playing — and that’s the honest truth, I’ve had my Scorpio dev kit sitting there — I’ve been playing, I feel it in load times. I can feel it, I can see it, and it matters to me.”\n\nFor Microsoft, a testimonial like that from Spencer, a former intern plucked from its internal game development arm to run the entire Xbox business, is about as strong as it gets.\n",

          "description": "Back in August, I published a comprehensive guide to the new science of treating back pain. Immediately my inbox filled with emails about a doctor readers felt I’d overlooked: the late John Sarno.\n\n“Thousands of people, including myself and my husband, cured our chronic back pain using [Sarno’s] methods,” wrote Karen Karvonen. Another Sarno devotee, Steven Schroeder, said the doctor saved his life. Schroeder’s back pain flared whenever he was stressed — a busy time at work, an illness in his family. After he absorbed Sarno’s books, the discomfort mostly vanished.\n\n“I still sometimes have pain now in times of stress — but I can literally make it go away with mental focus,” Schroeder, a lawyer in Chicago, wrote in an email. “It is crazy.”\n\nThough he may not be a household name, Sarno is probably America’s most famous back pain doctor. Before his death on June 22, a day shy of his 94th birthday, he published four books and built a cult-like following of thousands of patients — including Howard Stern, and Larry David. Many of them claim to have been healed by Sarno, who essentially argued back pain was all in people’s heads. And Sarno himself often said that some 80 percent of his patients got better.\n\nI first came across the back pain guru months ago in my research. But I was skeptical of his theories, which were largely based on hunches and anecdote. He admitted that he never tested his ideas with controlled studies, saying he’d rather spend his time healing patients at his New York University practice than doing research. At first glance, he seemed like an outdated Freudian.\n\nBeloved by his patients, Sarno was also derided by his medical peers. He didn’t have much of an influence on medical research during his lifetime. Tellingly, his NYU colleagues never referred their patients to him.\n\n“It is not really credible to claim that you can cure 75 percent or more of patients with chronic low back pain, especially since no one has been able to duplicate these kinds of results or even close to it, as far as I’m aware,” said Roger Chou, a back pain expert and professor at Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nBut even if Sarno didn’t play by the rules of science, he endures. He inspired people — and still does. He managed to write best-selling books and attract patients from across the country to NYU. He’s the subject of a 60 Minutes feature and a recent documentary, All the Rage: Saved by Sarno, that was screened around the world. Sarno’s followers continue to record their stories on their “Thank You, Dr. Sarno” project. “I know you never liked hearing it, but I owe my life to you,” Ted H. wrote in July.\n\nAfter digging a little deeper, I learned that some of Sarno’s theories are now even being validated by science — specifically, that there can sometimes be an emotional basis for chronic back pain. And that’s an important truth mainstream pain medicine still hasn’t quite figured out what to do with.\n\nSarno believed our brain used pain to distract us from experiencing negative emotions\n\n Sarno argued back pain arose as a result of a psychosomatic process and emotional factors. Angie Wang\n\nLower back pain is among the chief reasons people go to see a doctor in the US, and nearly a third of American adults say they’ve been afflicted. The US spends approximately $90 billion a year on back pain — more than the annual expenditures on high blood pressure, pregnancy and postpartum care, and depression — and that doesn’t include the estimated $10 billion to $20 billion in back pain-related lost productivity.\n\nDoctors have overwhelmingly failed people with back pain. Many of the most popular treatments on offer — bed rest, spinal surgery, opioid painkillers, steroid injections — have been proven ineffective in the majority of cases, and sometimes downright harmful. Only in the past couple of years, with the rise of the opioid epidemic, has the medical establishment begun to acknowledge this failure and suggest people explore alternatives for their sore backs.\n\nEnter John Sarno. A specialist in rehabilitation medicine, he had very different notions about the causes of back pain than his medical peers. Sarno was most active during the 1980s and ’90s, a time when back discomfort was thought to arise mainly in the presence a mechanical problem (a bulging disc, say, or joint arthritis). Instead, he argued the pain was actually the result of a psychosomatic process and emotional factors.\n\nMore specifically, he believed that the brain distracts us from experiencing negative emotions by creating pain. We may not want to accept the uncomfortable truths that we are angry with our children, or that we hate our job, so instead of thinking those thoughts, we focus on the pain.\n\nHe also thought that pain was created by reduced oxygen and blood flow to the muscles and nerves of the body. So our brains unconsciously direct blood away from certain areas of our body, and that creates pain. (If this focus on the unconscious mind sounds familiar, it’s because Sarno was heavily influenced by Freud. His book The Divided Mind was all about psychosomatic medicine, including Freud’s pivotal influence.)\n\nSarno coined a term for his diagnosis — “tension myoneural syndrome” — and believed many people could overcome their pain simply by acknowledging its psychosomatic origins. He instructed many of his patients to journal or seek out psychotherapy, to gain a better understanding of the emotions they were repressing that generated their chronic back pain. He also advised they immediately resume physical activity, that it would make them better and not worse.\n\nTo get a feel for his approach, here are some of the dos and don’ts from Healing Back Pain, published in 1991:\n\n Back pain dos and don’ts in John Sarno’s Healing Back Pain.\n\nMany doctors still think Sarno’s views on back pain are off\n\nBack pain researchers and doctors generally didn’t find Sarno convincing — and many still don’t. Andrea Furlan, a psychiatrist who has published numerous systematic reviews on back pain, says the big problem with Sarno’s approach was that it was too “one-size-fits-all.” Some people’s back pain may be exacerbated by emotional problems or stress, but not everyone’s. “I think it is a mistake to generalize [the mind-body model] to all people with back pain,” Furlan said.\n\n“Blaming this all on repressed emotions is a pretty narrow view of psychological contributors to pain,” Oregon’s Chou added. “It ignores a lot of what we understand now about changes that occur centrally in persons with chronic pain.” For example, we now have MRI studies showing that people with chronic pain have different areas of their brain light up when they are exposed to painful stimuli.\n\n“Sarno had no interest in seeing brain MRIs,” said Cathryn Jakobson Ramin, author of the book Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery. “He was actually very limited in his scope ... until his last days, stuck in a Freudian mindset, viewing what was going on with patients as evidence of psychological problems rather than neurological problems.”\n\nThe mechanism Sarno proposed — about decreased blood flow caused by the brain — was also never supported by science, explained Howard Schubiner, who heads a mind-body medicine program at Providence Hospital in Michigan, which was inspired by Sarno’s work. “It made no sense to a lot of scientists and physicians.”\n\nBut there are some things Sarno got right, Schubiner added. “The science is catching up to Dr. Sarno.”\n\nSarno got some things right\n\n Sarno with Michael Galinsky, maker of the documentary All the Rage: Saved by Sarno. Rumur Inc.\n\nIt’s now mainstream to view chronic back pain as a “biopsychosocial” condition — meaning biological factors (such as a person’s weight or spine structure) may play a role but psychological and social factors can too. Researchers have found, for example, that people who are under stress or are prone to depression, catastrophizing, and anxiety tend to suffer more with chronic back pain, as do those who have histories of trauma in their early lives or poor job satisfaction.\n\n“Was [Sarno] the first person to discover the mind-body connection? Or course not,” said Schubiner. “But Sarno popularized it [in the area of back pain].”\n\nA new understanding of pain, commonly referred to as “central sensitization,” is also gaining traction. The basic idea is that in some people who have ongoing pain, there are changes that occur between the body and brain that heighten pain sensitivity — to the point where even things that normally don’t hurt are perceived as painful. That means some people with chronic low back pain may actually be suffering from malfunctioning pain signals. So again, it’s what’s going on in the mind that matters for their pain, more so than what’s going on in their bodies.\n\nNow, this doesn’t mean everybody’s back pain has a psychological root cause. It also doesn’t mean the mechanism Sarno suggested — decreased blood flow created by the brain — has been validated, or that it’s repressed emotions that hurt people. But Sarno was ahead of the science with his broader mind-body approach.\n\nSarno-esque approaches are slowly catching on\n\nThere were other things Sarno got right, whether or not the science of his time backed him up. He was also a strong advocate that people with back pain shouldn’t take bed rest and stop their daily activities, which were pretty mainstream remedies in the 1980s and ’90s, when he was publishing his books.\n\nDoctors now think that bed rest is a very bad idea in most cases, and studies comparing exercise to no exercise for chronic low back pain are consistently clear: Physical activity can help relieve pain, while being inactive can delay a person’s recovery.\n\n“What he recommended as treatment was essentially cognitive behavioral therapy — elimination of fear avoidant behavior and catastrophizing — before anyone had ever heard of it,” Ramin said, “and it’s exactly what is being used now to treat patients with central sensitization.”\n\nSarno-esque approaches are slowly catching on for back pain. “Multidisciplinary rehabilitation” is increasingly popular. This approach views back pain as the result of the interplay of physical, psychological, and social factors. Practitioners do things like help patients get treatment for their depression or anxiety, or guide them through cognitive behavioral therapy to improve their coping skills as part of their back pain therapy. (As I noted in my guide to back pain science, multidisciplinary therapy appears to work slightly better than physical therapy alone for chronic back pain in both the short and long term.)\n\nSchubiner has co-authored several studies looking at the impact of Sarno-style pain management. The most recent, published in the journal Pain, was the first large-scale randomized controlled trial to show that guiding people with chronic pain (in this case, caused by fibromyalgia) through how to process and express powerful emotions such as anger worked better than regular cognitive behavior therapy at reducing fibromyalgia symptoms.\n\nSarno also intuitively understood that anatomical abnormalities like lumbar disc bulges are not actually the source of pain for many people — and called these injuries “normal abnormalities.” Research over the past two decades has piled up to prove him right. For example, when you compare people with the same MRI results showing the same back injury — bulging discs, say, or facet joint arthritis — some may experience terrible chronic pain while others report no pain at all.\n\nAfter testing Sarno’s methods, Schubiner now thinks the people who say they have been cured by Sarno are probably a minority of outspoken patients with back pain that happens to be exacerbated by stress or emotional problems. That means there are people out there with chronic pain who could benefit from psychotherapy. But that’s not true for every back pain patient. (And there are surely other people who didn’t experience life-changing healing after reading Sarno but are less likely to speak up.)\n\nAt the end of the recent Sarno documentary, his fans from the “Thank You, Dr. Sarno” project present him with a book of people’s healing stories. Sarno says, \"All of this because of one simple idea: the fact that the mind and the body are intimately connected. That's it. That’s the whole story.\"\n\nMichael Galinsky, the maker of the documentary, told me this line from the documentary resonated. “While that might seem to be an obvious truth, the biotechnical approach to medicine essentially negates it in regards to practice,” Galinsky said. That’s now slowly shifting, but it took an unprecedented opioid epidemic — instead of a charismatic doctor — to spur change.\n",

          "description": "If the word camping evokes flashlights, heavy backpacks and bring-your-own toilet paper, “glamping” — or glamorous camping — is more like vintage oil lamps, massages at your request and in-tent bathrooms with heated floors. While the exact origins of the practice of modern-day luxury camping are unclear, it likely became popular in the UK first before spreading to other countries around the world.\n\n“When we started with 200 accommodations three years ago, the majority of those were in the US,” says Jessica Armstrong, head of public relations and partnerships at GlampingHub.com. Now, she says, Canada and Australia are two of the top leaders in their market after the countries grew exponentially over the last couple of years. Global glampsites are on the rise in countries across the globe and their amenities leave almost nothing to be desired. Here are some of our favorites.\n\nClayoquot Wilderness Resort — Vancouver Island, Canada\n\nAn “en-suite tent” at this British Columbia resort comes with a king-sized bed, private deck and laundry service, but the en-suite bathroom is the real star of the show. Along with spa slippers and robes, it features double sinks, a private outdoor covered shower and a heated floor. Glampers can choose between waterfront, rainforest and sunrise tents, and inside, the light selections alone spell out luxury — vintage oil lamps, candles set in antique silver and crystal and, of course, electric light. Guests have access to their own remote-controlled, propane-fueled, cast-iron wood stoves, while dishes like crab ravioli and Cornish game hen make an appearance on the resort menu. In the event guests need additional relaxation, the resort spa offers both hot stone and deep tissue massages. All-inclusive rates from $1,283–$2,005 per person per night for a three-night package. Four- and seven-night packages are also available.\n\nImage courtesy of Clayoquot Wilderness Resort.\nAman-i-Khas — Ranthambore, India\n\nIn a normal camping tent, each person is usually allotted about 15 square feet — but at Aman-i-Khas, a resort in northern India, the Mughal-inspired tents measure 1,162 square feet. Fine cotton screens separate each tent into sleeping, dressing, dining and living areas, while the tents boast fully equipped bathrooms with full-size bathtubs, air conditioning and heating, king-size beds, twin writing desks, oversized daybeds, sun decks and, of course, Wi-Fi. Each couple or family of glampers is looked after by their own personal butler, who serves food and drinks and arranges activities. The dining tent offers both Indian and Western dishes, the lounge tent is furnished with banquettes and reading tables, while the spa tent features massages and a step-well pool. For adventurous travelers, there are twice-daily guided safaris into Ranthambore National Park to view tigers, leopards, hyenas, antelopes and more than 350 known species of birds. From $1,350 per night. \n\nImage courtesy of Aman-i-Khas.\nSingita Sabora Tented Camp — Grumeti Reserves, Tanzania\n\nIt’s a 1920s-style explorer’s camp in northern Tanzania and it’s lavish, with tents housing four-poster canopy beds, Persian rugs, Zanzibari chests and claw-foot bathtubs. Just steps from the tents are the plains, with scattered daybeds for napping and watching the local game from afar. Glampers can enjoy electricity and Wi-Fi, plus a swimming pool and a gym. The camp’s spa offers stress-relief and relaxation treatments, with massage tools made from the wood of the Mwarobaini, a medicinal Swahili tree that’s used to treat more than 40 ailments. Adventurous guests can take advantage of guided safari walks and game drives for the chance to view species like bat-eared foxes, Maasai giraffes, elephants, buffalo, cheetahs, black rhinos and zebras. Contact Singita Sabora Tented Camp for rates.\n\nImage courtesy of Singita Sabora Tented Camp.\nJoy’s Camp Shaba — Shaba National Reserve, Kenya\n\nThis Kenyan camp is located on the site of the former home of Joy Adamson — naturalist and author of “Born Free” — and it partners with a wildlife conservancy to fundraise for the surrounding ecosystem. The boutique camp’s luxury tents include large main bedrooms, verandas for outdoor seating and bathrooms with stone floors and hot running water. From the camp, guests can catch glimpses of elephants, buffalos, lions and other plains animals and when guests aren’t relaxing in their tents, they can enjoy the swimming pool with bar service, massages, manicures, pedicures, painting materials, game drives, guided plains walks and picnic breakfasts. As far as meals, menus include fresh homemade breads and pastas, organic salads, Italian risottos — private romantic dinners can be arranged on request. From $270 per person per night; prices vary depending on the season.\n\nImage courtesy of Joy’s Camp Shaba.\nPatagonia Camp — Torres del Paine, Chile\n\nCan you say yurt suite? Besides a luxury bedroom, these Mongolian-style tents feature bathtubs and rain showers, central heating, private terraces, lounges with Nespresso machines and — here’s the kicker — outdoor hot tubs. The transparent circular dome in the center of each tent was historically used as a chimney for the Mongols’ fires, but today, guests use it to stargaze. As for views, the yurts look out onto the Cordillera Paine mountains and Lake Toro, and Wi-Fi, laundry and room service are offered to all guests. Patagonia Camp also has an on-site restaurant, bar and lounge, while the menu includes crab, salmon, lamb and locally grown vegetables. From $440 per night.\n\nImage courtesy of Patagonia Camp.\nWhere are your favorite places around the world to go glamping?

Per triennial data from the US Federal Reserve published this week, people with college degrees these days have a median net worth more than four times that of people without. “Shares of income and wealth held by affluent families have reached historically high levels,” the Fed wrote in its report.\n\nIt’s not that college-educated Americans are making dramatically more money than before—in fact, their median net worth has only grown 2% between 2013 and 2016—but rather that those without college degrees still have a long way to go to catch up. In that three-year period for which Fed data was collected, the median net worth for those with only a high school diploma actually jumped around 25%, from $54,100 to $67,100. But the median net worth for those with college degrees is $292,100.\n\nWhat’s the fix for such large disparity? Of course there’s no panacea—but a combination of government policy programs pledging free or reduced college tuition, university-led initiatives to make degrees more accessible to a wider population, and shifts in employers’ hiring priorities could all help. Such efforts are all in the works, but it’s unclear how long it will be until we see their effects in the Fed’s future reports.\n\nUniversity education is also only one facet of the US’s broader struggle with wealth inequality—even as household income in the country is overall on the rise.\n\nRead this next: It’s the end of the university as we know it\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Chinese tourists have the reputation they do for a reason.\n\nTheir antics and outlandish behavior—such as the case of a teenager defacing an Egyptian pyramid in 2013—have become well-documented in news and social media, and China knows such acts reflect poorly on the country. To preempt further damage, Chinese embassy officials in Singapore have published a 27-page pamphlet for mainland tourists with travel guidelines and etiquette. Among the advice it offers: “Don’t try to bribe custom officials when you are rejected entry with a valid visa.”\n\nNearly 6 million people from China are expected to travel abroad during the 68th National Day holiday, a week-long break known as Golden Week that kicks off Sunday (Oct. 1). In anticipation of this, the new booklet details accepted behavior and rules of conduct in the city-state, which received nearly 2 million Chinese tourists in the first seven months of 2017, according to Singapore’s tourism board.\n\nTop international travel destinations during the 2017 National Day Holiday, according to China’s travel agency Ctrip. (Quartz)\n\nThe first copies of the pamphlet, titled “Safe and Civilized Travel for Chinese Citizens in the Lion City,” were given to 20 Chinese tourists on Sept. 22 shortly after they arrived in Changi Airport, having agreed to partake in a press conference held by the embassy. The 10-chapter guide (link in Chinese) covers more than a hundred “dos and don’ts.”\n\nHere are some of the dos:\n\nReach out to the airline staff if you feel disturbed by other passengers. Don’t get into a fight.\n\nGive a proper tip—in cash—to the hotel porter who helps carry luggage to your room.\n\nGive precedence to others when taking photos at tourist sites. Don’t fight for spots or hinder others when they are taking pictures. Please say thank you when asking others for help taking a photo.\n\nDress clean and proper. Although the weather in Singapore is hot, don’t reveal the chest and bare arms.\n\nAsk for permission if you don’t have time and wish to jump the queue.\n\nAnd some of the don’ts:\n\nDon’t take the life vests and blankets off the plane.\n\nDon’t bring durian (a fruit known for its strong odor) on public transportation.\n\nDon’t take the ashtray or bath towels from guest rooms.\n\nDon’t use towels or bed sheets to wipe your shoes. Use the hotel’s facilities properly, and follow the rules for its swimming pool.\n\nDon’t evade bus fare.\n\nThese suggestions come following a series of uncouth Chinese visitor behavior in recent years. In 2014, for example, four mainland tourists threw hot water and noodles at a flight attendant because their group wasn’t seated together on a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, forcing the plane to turn back. In 2013, a tour group of 30 lifted stainless-steel cutlery from a Singapore Airlines plane and refused to return them until the group’s tour guide said the act was “hurting the reputation of Chinese people.”\n\nThe latest pamphlet is in line with travel guidelines issued by Chinese officials. In 2013, China’s national tourism administration issued a 64-page booklet titled “Guidebook for Civilized Tourism,” following an earlier one-page version in 2006, which contained rules such as: Don’t sneeze at others, and don’t force foreigners to take group photos (link in Chinese).\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Big retailers, like Walmart, have a massive shoplifting problem. The company loses about $3 billion, or about 1% of its annual sales, every year to theft. Police across the country are overwhelmed by the volume of daily phone calls from local Walmart stores.\n\nIn 2016, the retailer came up with a solution. It hired two companies that would target the problem using education programs billed as “restorative justice,” a philosophy that addresses the community harm in a given crime, and avoids being unnecessarily punitive.\n\nThe practices of one of these providers, the Corrective Education Company (CEC), have raised questions in recent years. In August, a California state court ruled in a lawsuit that its operations are “textbook extortion.” The case also suggests that CEC’s operations have little to do with the concept and intentions of restorative justice, an expert says.\n\nHow the program works\n\nCEC and Walmart, which is not named in the lawsuit, have not responded to repeated Quartz requests for interviews. As recounted in court documents, media reports, and online accounts from self-professed shoplifters—here’s what the process typically looks like:\n\nA shoplifter is caught or accused of stealing from a store. If they are a first-time offender, not part of an organized-crime group, and not intoxicated, security officers will show them a video explaining that they can pay several hundred dollars (up to $500) to participate in a 6-8 hour online course.\n\nCEC’s founder, in an promotional video on the company’s website, says the program is meant to help people understand their behavior and its consequences, and includes an element that teaches “life skills,” such as how to build a resume or a nutrition plan. They can take the course at a later time, and the company says they have 48 hours to make up their minds.\n\nThe alternative is a phone call to local police—according to the company, about 90% of the accused shoplifters who watched the video in California chose the CEC route. The lawsuit alleges the company gets the bulk of the fee, and it also pays a chunk to the retailer and security contractors.\n\n CEC calls the program a win for all.  CEC, founded by two Harvard Business School graduates in 2010, calls the program a win for all. The store does not have to constantly interact with law-enforcement agencies. Police do not have to respond to hundreds of petty-theft cases. The accused offender avoids getting sucked into the criminal-justice system, and the community doesn’t have to pay the costs associated with the process. CEC, which has worked with other retailers such as Bloomingdale’s and Whole Foods Market across the country, says their recidivism rate is less than 2 percent—although the methodology they use to come up with this statistic is unclear. CEC also claims calls made to police have fallen as much as 40% in some locations.\n\nThe problem with private solutions\n\nThe suit in California, filed in 2015 by the San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, called the CEC process “extortion.” Detaining an accused shoplifter in order to show them the video should be considered false imprisonment, the suit alleged, something that big retailers have been accused of for years. A judge agreed in an Aug. 14 ruling, calling it a “textbook extortion,” and holding that the program indeed constituted illegal false imprisonment under California law—noting however, that he did not need to decide whether CEC’s program is beneficial or not to the public.\n\nThe ruling means that CEC will be prohibited from continuing its current practices; the judge has asked Herrera’s team and CEC to reach an agreement as to the exact scope of the prohibitions, which will eventually be entered as a court order. (CEC will have an opportunity to appeal the ruling.)\n\nThe Utah-based company said in a statement it was “shocked and dismayed” by the decision: “We believe this ruling goes against the values of Californians. We are disheartened for our partners and even more importantly for those Californians who face a lifelong scarlet letter because of one bad choice.”\n\nTo be sure, reducing the number of people who get arrested, jailed, and left with a conviction on their record—which often prevents them from getting jobs—is an important goal in a country that locks up more people than nearly any other place on Earth. And it should come as no surprise that most of the accused prefer to avoid interacting with law enforcement. They pony up the fee and log on to complete the course. (The company says it offers reduced fees but told Slate in 2015 that 85% of the offenders pay the full price, and only 2% have qualified for a full discount).\n\nHowever, involving the police in shoplifting cases does not mean automatically locking up and convicting suspects. David Karp, a professor of sociology at Skidmore College and expert on restorative justice, tells Quartz that first-time offenders might not end up with a serious charge, or any sort of jail time. Getting sucked into the criminal-justice system usually isn’t helpful to a defendant, Karp says, but it does offer legal protections that are not guaranteed when dealing with private companies.\n\nSlate interviewed several defense attorneys about the program, and they all expressed serious concerns about a private company acting as a judge, especially considering that retailers make mistakes when identifying shoplifters.\n\nWhat’s more, police, prosecutors, and courts have access to their own diversion programs for misdemeanor offenses (although these come with a hefty price tag as well). CEC could partner with police in programs in which officers could refer eligible shoplifters, Karp says: “That puts the power of the decision-making more in the hands of the defendant.”\n\nThe California suit also alleged the program creates incentives for retailers and security operators to push the CEC option, instead of ensuring alleged offenders get due process through the legal system.\n\nWhat is restorative justice?\n\nCEC says it operates according to the tenets of restorative justice, a concept outlined by American criminologist Howard Zehr in his seminal 1990 book Changing Lenses, A New Focus for Crime and Justice. The philosophy draws from the justice systems of indigenous groups in the United States and Canada, as well as New Zealand. It does not focus on “punishing a person by inflicting some kind of harm on them that’s similar to the harm that they caused others,” says Karp. Instead, it’s “about having the offender somehow address the harm that they caused,” whether it’s emotional, material, or it affects the broader community.\n\nKarp says that generally, the idea that the CEC program is meant to be educational rather than punitive falls in line with the philosophy’s precepts. But, although he hasn’t seen the program’s content, he is skeptical of its claim to be a restorative-justice solution.\n\n “The true impact from restorative justice comes from a face-to-face discussion of the impact of a person’s behavior on others.”  One big issue is the program’s online aspect (it’s also reportedly available on paper). “The true impact from restorative justice comes from a face-to-face discussion of the impact of a person’s behavior on others,” Karp says. “What we generally know about prevention-based programming is that online educational workshops are not effective in changing behavior.”\n\nThen there’s the question of the money paid by the alleged offender. Restitution, as traditionally understood, is payment for losses. “The person caught shoplifting never got the item out of the store, so there is no direct loss that the person is responsible for reimbursing,” he says.\n\n“There is a cost associated with loss prevention, but that cost is not specified and it is unclear what the obligation of one shoplifter is toward that overall cost,” he adds. With all of this uncertainty, he says, ” it is easy to see how other motives can appear,” such as financial gain for the retailers, and for CEC (The security company also receives a cut). Karp calls the CEC solution more of a fine combined with an “untested” rehabilitation program, rather than true restorative justice.\n\nA big retail store is not the best setting for restorative justice\n\nUsing restorative justice in a situation where the victim is a massive corporation is not ideal. “It works best when the harm is clear. When I steal your phone, punch you in the face, and that discussion is really impactful. When the harm is really unclear, like this two-dollar item at this two-billion-dollar company, it doesn’t really work quite as well,” Karp says. The mentality of shoplifting being a “victimless crime” is clear when you read Reddit posts from shoplifters who talk about the Walmart-owning Walton family as “silver-spooned assholes.”\n\nThere is a way for even large retailers to address shoplifting in ways that fall in line with restorative-justice principles, Karp says.\n\nThe Longmont Community Justice Partnership in Colorado, founded in 1992, works with large retailers, taking a much more involved approach. It primarily works with the local Kohl’s store, as well as Target and Home Depot, and had gotten referrals from Walmart before they introduced their own program.\n\nAn outside recidivism study of the Colorado program for 2007-2008 showed that fewer than 10% of those who completed the course were rearrested within a year. Offenders also have to pay for the program on a sliding scale, with a maximum $125 fee.\n\nIn the Longmont process, the retailer’s representative decides whether to offer the restorative-justice option. A police officer will give an offender the official referral, says Abby Whipple, Longmont program manager. This keeps law enforcement involved and, at least in theory, ensures a degree of due process.\n\nBecause the organization was getting so many referrals from the local Kohl’s, it recently introduced a group program in which offenders, community members, and store representatives speak in a series of meetings, along with facilitators. The offenders hear about the harm they had caused, and share their own stories.\n\n“Across the board I can hear them saying ’I just don’t see how [the shoplifting] would make a difference to anyone,’” Whipple says. Most are between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nIn an intimate, personal setting, a huge company like Kohl’s offers a human face—the store’s loss-prevention representative. Whipple says he outlines all the ways the community is affected by shoplifting. Prices may rise since retailers have to recoup their losses; employee hours may be cut, and positions eliminated; lines at stores can get longer; there can be losses in tax revenue for the town, money which could have been used for parks and filling potholes. “On top of that,” Whipple says in recounting the rep’s approach, “you have employees in the store, who care about it and appreciate their jobs, and they feel both on edge and victimized by people attempting to shoplift from the store.”\n\nShe says the offenders primarily relate to the lost job opportunities, as well as longer lines and higher prices.\n\nAt the end of the process, the parties come up with a contract, according to what Whipple calls a “strength-based” approach. The loss-prevention representative asks the offenders write letters of reflection, and has a massive stack of them in his office. One person made a piece of graffiti art that spells out “Don’t Steal.” Another baked cheesecakes that were shared with all of the store’s employees. A police officer told a career-oriented 17-year-old girl to develop a business plan, which he saw as valuable to the community, as part of her contract.\n\n“We want everyone to see the humanness in the other people that have been involved in what happened—including the police, the loss-prevention rep. Making an ‘us’ out of everyone who has to respond to this incident.”\n\nA reflection of a broader debate\n\nThe contrast between the approaches of Corrective Education Company and the Longmont Community Justice Partnership is indicative of a larger rift in efforts to reform the US criminal-justice system.\n\nOn one side, you have methods that focus on old-school, face-to-face interaction, the “human” element. On the other, you have technology companies that offer to make the system more attuned to today’s world—making communication easier and processes more efficient, programs such as CEC’s, video-chatting services in prisons and jails, or providers of sentencing algorithm software.\n\nBut when profit enters the equation, things often turn against alleged offenders, especially those with fewer resources to defend themselves.",

Well, except for one aircraft. People from around the world were fascinated by images of a Delta 737 flying to San Juan, Puerto Rico as Irma approached. They weren’t actual images or video of an aircraft, though. It was merely an icon on an map from flight tracking site Flightradar24.\n\nFlightradar24 is the largest of several aircraft tracking services available to the public. Flightradar and other similar services let users zoom into any part of the world and see aircraft movement in real time, even while planes are still on the ground at many airports.\n\nThese services rely primarily on a technology known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast, or ADS-B for short. ADS-B collects vital position and movement data from an aircraft’s transponder, such as altitude, speed, heading, and dozens of other attributes, and transmits it at a frequency of 1090 MHz to anyone listening.\n\nAs air traffic control slowly shifts from a 20th-century technology, radar-based tracking of aircraft, to ADS-B, Flightradar has been constructing its own network of receivers worldwide. Each receiver consists of a small computer, a GPS antenna and an ADS-B frequency antenna. Flightradar distributes the receivers to local hosts anywhere in the world it may need to boost coverage in exchange for premium site subscriptions. Alternatively, local hosts may have their own equipment and choose to upload data to multiple sites.\n\nSome of the places volunteers have placed receivers are nothing short of amazing. From the Troll Research Station in Antarctica to Chernobyl, Ukraine, these receivers are capable of providing detailed flight information in areas where traditional radar coverage has never existed, and will never exist.\n\nThe new Flightradar24 ADS-B receiver approximately 1.5 km from the Chernobyl nuclear plant, visible in the background. Image by Flightradar24.\n“Flightradar24 now has over 16,000 ADS-B receivers around world helping track flights on all seven continents,” said Ian Petchenik, Director of Communications for Flightradar24. “We track an average of 175,000 flights per month and that number continues to rise as we add new receivers.”\n\nWhile Flightradar covers thousands of flights per day, the airline industry is still far from equipping all aircraft with ADS-B technology. In the United States, approximately 52% of aircraft transmit ADS-B signals, a number that hasn’t significantly risen in recent years, even has a 2020 mandate to equip all airplanes looms. Globally, the number jumps to 65%, but still a far cry from every aircraft.\n\nIn order to track aircraft that aren’t transmitting ADS-B location data, a technology called Multilateration (MLAT) is used. MLAT uses multiple ADS-B receivers to triangulate the approximate location of an aircraft to an accuracy of about 10-20 meters with coverage nearly down to ground level and a delay of a few seconds. MLAT tracking isn’t perfect, but it’s far better than the radar data provided by the FAA when all else fails. In the case where an aircraft operates far outside of the coverage area, Flightradar will estimate its flight path along the shortest path to its destination. Once it re-enters coverage, the actual position is then displayed.\n\nA flight being tracked with MLAT compared to the GPS location from on board the tracked aircraft.\nAs we all learned in third grade science class, most of the planet is water, not land. This fact presents a bit of a problem for a company that relies on ground-based receivers. In an attempt to cover the remaining 71% of the planet’s surface, Flightradar has been experimenting with tiny satellites equipped with ADS-B receives. During a trial in 2016, Flightradar was able to receive terrestrial-bound signals from aircraft over the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. A separate waterborne trial was conducted by equipping a small autonomous boat with ADS-B receivers and a satellite uplink. The aptly nicknamed “floatradar” boat can be remotely positioned to boost coverage in critical areas.\n\nWhile Flightradar has nearly global coverage at this point, some aircraft will never be shown on the map. This isn’t due to any particular technical reason or issue, but rather because they are military or specific private aircraft. To protect operational security of military operations, as well as the privacy or certain private jet operators, these aircraft either have their details censored or are removed from the database entirely. Removal of private aircraft is conducted per request, and not proactively. Sorry, but you will never see Air Force One on Flightradar.\n\nTo some hardcore planespotters and aviation geeks, hiding certain aircraft is a bit of a problem. Just like how Flightradar has built out a network of crowdsourced ADS-B receivers, a website named ADS-B Exchange has attempted to do the same, but without hiding any aircraft information. While its worldwide coverage is nowhere near as robust as Flightradar, all aircraft, including military aircraft, are displayed.\n\nTracking military aircraft over New York City during the UN General Assembly on ADS-B Exchange. On the left is a US Air Force tanker circling the city to refuel patrolling fighter jets; on the right a French Air Force VIP jet.\nADS-B Exchange says its site displays all data unfiltered because the ADS-B signals emitted from aircraft are unencrypted and over-the-air, much like an ordinary radio signal, and anyone with $100 and an Amazon account can build their own receiver. Leaving the data unfiltered is valuable to plane spotters looking to snap shots of unusual or special aircraft.\n\nIn a few short years, flight tracking has gone from proprietary government and airline data to freely accessible and available nearly anywhere on the planet. As space-based receivers become cheaper, there will not be a single place left uncovered by the various tracking services in operation today.\n",

And you can access them through a digital antenna, which runs from $10 to $150 and will grant you access to live broadcasts from networks like ABC, CBS, the CW, Fox, and NBC.\n\nEntertainment Weekly has a full list of the shows you can find in primetime this fall.\n\nVIDEO\n\nNew TV episodes will soon be streaming soon, too\n\nIf you don’t have an HD antenna or pay-TV package, you can still stream some of the most sought-after shows on broadcast and cable TV, like The Walking Dead, The Big Bang Theory, and the new Will & Grace. You just may have to wait.\n\nCBS All Access will get you new and old episodes of all the new and current CBS shows like The Big Bang Theory, Kevin Can Wait, NCIS, and Criminal Minds, and even allow you to watch them live.\n\nSome new episodes of shows from broadcasters like ABC, Fox, and NBC, such as Dancing With the Stars, This Is Us, and Empire, head to Hulu the day after they air on TV. Others are added to the service after the full season has aired. And some cable shows like AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead and FX’s You’re the Worst and American Horror Story hit Hulu, before subsequent seasons premiere on TV.\n\nNew episodes of shows on the CW also come to Netflix a week after the seasons wrap on TV in the US. So you’ll be able to catch new episodes of shows like The Flash, Supernatural, and Riverdale sometime in 2018. (Lucky viewers in regions like the UK and Australia will reportedly be able to watch new episodes on Netflix shortly after they air on TV.) Netflix also usually gets new seasons of top AMC shows like The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul before the next season begins; season seven of The Walking Dead is up on the service now ahead of its Oct. 22 debut.\n\nWith a little patience, you can catch most of the season’s TV offerings without signing up for a costly pay-TV bundle.\n\nRead this next: For the cost of YouTube’s $35-a-month TV bundle, this is what you could get instead\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Between January 1 and July 31 this year, the state of New Jersey has seen its pretrial jail population — the number of people sitting in detention, awaiting trial, without having been convicted of a crime — fall by 15.8 percent.\n\nThat’s an astonishing drop in under a year. It means that 2,167 fewer people were in pretrial detention on July 31, 2017, than were at the same time in 2016. That’s more than 2,000 people who have not been convicted of any wrongdoing, and who get to live at home with their families rather than in a jail cell, who stand a better chance of keeping their jobs and their kids, whose lives aren’t unnecessarily disrupted so they can be locked in a cage.\n\nAnd as this happened, New Jersey’s crime rate actually fell. Violent crime in January through August 2017 was 16.7 percent lower than the same period of 2016. Murder fell by 28.6 percent, assault by 13.3 percent, robbery by 22 percent. By contrast, violent crime only fell 4.3 percent in 2016, and didn’t budge in 2015. It’s far too soon to say if bail reform contributed to the big year-to-year drop. But at the very least, bail reform hasn’t been accompanied with some dramatic increase in danger or crime. More people are free, and more people are safe.\n\n New Jersey Judiciary\n\nThe jail trends are the result of sweeping bail reforms adopted by the New Jersey state legislature, with the help of a voter-approved constitutional amendment, in 2014. The reforms effectively abolish cash bail: the practice of only letting people out of pretrial detention if they are financially capable to pay the state (or, more often, a bail bondsman) to release them. In its place, judges now decide which defendants to detain and which to release based on a variety of factors, including quantitative “public safety assessment scores” based on a defendant’s criminal history and past record of appearing in court.\n\nThe result is that thousands of people who’d otherwise be in jail for being poor are free, and courts are able to detain wealthy people who could’ve been let free via bail but are now judged too dangerous for release.\n\nThe embarrassing part? I didn’t know about most of this until I moved to New Jersey in August. What coverage I saw tended to focus on convicted murderer and racial slur enthusiast Duane “Dog the Bounty Hunter” Chapman’s opposition to the law (which should, if anything, make you support it more). I was too focused on fights in DC around health care and the fate of deportation relief, and not keeping an eye on one state’s criminal justice reforms. Those national fights are really important; I would never diminish them for a second. Their human stakes are immense.\n\nBut so are those of the New Jersey reforms. Thousands of people being uncaged is a cause for national celebration, not just parochial interest.\n\nIt’s easy to pay lip service to the fact that some of the most important government decisions are made at the state, not federal, level. But three cases in New Jersey and California, either being implemented or passed this year, really underline the point. There’s a real possibility, especially if Republican health care efforts fail, that the most significant changes in public policy in the United States this year in terms of human impact will have been caused by state legislatures, not Congress or President Trump.\n\nCalifornia’s changes are of national importance\n\nAs Congress geared up for the latest effort to repeal Obamacare, the California state legislature passed a package of bills to address its housing crisis. This isn’t just a California concern. As my colleague Matt Yglesias has repeatedly explained, the high cost of living in America’s most productive regions (like Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, but also New York, DC, and Boston) hurts the American economy as a whole.\n\nThe University of Chicago’s Chang-Tai Hsieh and UC Berkeley’s Enrico Moretti estimate that restrictions on building housing cut US economic growth in half from 1964 to 2009. Another paper of their estimates that if high-productivity cities like San Francisco and San Jose were to only restrict housing development as much as the typical city — and not the crazy amount they do restrict it — US GDP would grow 9.5 percent. Those are bananas numbers, and suggest that removing barriers to development in California and other rich areas is of huge national importance.\n\nLuckily, the California legislature has voted to remove some of those barriers. Both the assembly and the state Senate have passed SB 35, a proposal from freshman state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco. The law would crack down on cities that undersupply housing by expediting approval for new building projects in municipalities that are undershooting their housing goals. The Senate needs to pass it one more time, and then Gov. Jerry Brown needs to sign it, but Brown supports the bill and it’s all but a done deal.\n\nOne bill can’t fix the California housing crisis. But SB 35 is a big step in the right direction, and will enable more people to move to hugely productive areas of California and grow the American economy as a whole. The whole country should be celebrating.\n\nSame goes for the landmark climate change legislation California passed this year. With bipartisan backing, the state extended its cap-and-trade program through to 2030. The legislation built on SB 32, a bill passed in 2016 that mandated a 40 percent reduction in emissions relative to 1990 levels by 2030. \"It’s hard to overstate how ambitious this is,\" Brad Plumer wrote for Vox at the time. \"Few countries have ever achieved cuts this sharp while enjoying robust economic growth.\" Achieving that goal will be difficult, and would’ve been more difficult if the cap and trade program had lapsed, a real possibility due to legal challenges. So this year, the legislature protected cap and trade.\n\nThese are pretty quick glosses on three complicated policy achievements. Some environmental justice groups think California’s climate bills haven’t gone far enough, and do little to help people living near polluters. SB 35 doesn’t totally eliminate the ability of local policymakers to use zoning and other levers to keep out newcomers. Some local leaders, like Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, have been grumbling that bail reform lets too many accused criminals out on the street, despite the accompanying drop in crime; if they grumble louder, the reforms could be in danger.\n\nBut it’s important to know that big improvements in people’s lives can and do happen at the state level. They’re complex and caveated and don’t go far enough — but such is the story of all government action. This year, California and New Jersey legislators have passed and overseen, respectively, measures that will make America as a whole substantially better off. They may not get the attention of Republican legislative chicanery in Congress or state-level Republican law to suppress voting. But these efforts deserve attention and commendation.\n",

          "description": "Researchers working with mice may have found a way to convert “bad” white fat—which hoards calories, contributing to weight gain and obesity—into “good” brown fat—which actually helps burn calories.\n\nThe findings raise the prospect of developing more effective treatments, in people, for obesity and diabetes related to weight gain.\n\nWhite fat stores calories and pads our bellies, hips, and thighs. In contrast, brown fat, found near our necks and shoulders, burns calories through a process that generates heat.\n\nThe researchers found that blocking the activity of a specific protein in white fat triggered the fat to begin to brown into beige fat, a type of fat in between white and brown. Blocking the protein to create beige fat caused the fat cells to heat up and burn calories.\n\n“Our goal is to find a way to treat or prevent obesity,” says first author Irfan J. Lodhi, assistant professor of medicine in the endocrinology, metabolism, and lipid research division at Washington University in St. Louis. “Our research suggests that by targeting a protein in white fat, we can convert bad fat into a type of fat that fights obesity.”\n\nBeige fat was discovered in adult humans in 2015. Though it is almost like an intermediary between white fat and brown fat, Lodhi says it functions more like brown fat and can protect against obesity.\n\nHis team conducted a series of experiments in mice, creating a genetic strain of animals that didn’t make a key protein in their white fat cells. Those mice had more beige fat and were leaner than their littermates, even when they ate the same amount of food as other mice. They also burned more calories.\n\n“Mice normally have very low levels of the protein, called PexRAP, in their brown fat,” he says. “When we put the mice into a cold environment, levels of the protein also decreased in white fat, allowing that fat to behave more like brown fat. Cold induces brown and beige fats to burn stored energy and produce heat.”\n\nWhen Lodhi’s team blocked PexRAP in the animals, the mice converted white fat into beige fat that could burn calories.\n\nMore than two-thirds of adults in the United States are either overweight or obese. Some 30 million people have diabetes. These findings study suggest that if therapies could help convert their bad fat into good fat, those numbers might start to decline.\n\nLodhi says if the PexRAP protein could be blocked safely in white fat cells in humans, people might have an easier time losing weight.\n\n“The challenge will be finding safe ways to do that without causing a person to overheat or develop a fever, but drug developers now have a good target,” he says.\n\nThe study appears in the journal Cell Reports.\n\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants supported this work. Startup funds from the Washington University department of medicine and a Pilot & Feasibility Grant from the Washington University Diabetes Research Center provided additional funding. The China Scholarship Council provided additional support.\n\nThis article was originally published in Futurity. Edits have been made to this republication.

          "description": "Thin celebrities are partly responsible for inventing a new term: “skinny shaming.”\n\nProminent model Jaime King (pictured above) accused French fashion houses LVMH and Kering, who own brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Dior, of “body shaming” earlier this month, after they announced a ban of size-zero models from their catwalks. After decades facing accusations of promoting unhealthy body images, not to mention well-documented health issues among models, companies are now complying with the French government’s new law that requires models to obtain a doctor’s certificate before they walk down the runway.\n\n“I think it would be radically unfair to say if you’re a size zero, then you can’t work, just like it’s unfair to say that if you’re a size 16, you can’t work,” King told the New York Post. “I’m naturally really thin and sometimes it’s really hard for me to gain weight. When people on Instagram say, ‘Go eat a hamburger’, I’m like, ‘Wow, they’re body shaming me for the way I look’.”\n\n“Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. However, equating the trials and tribulations of a model told to “eat a hamburger,” with the treatment of someone perceived as overweight is a dangerous conflation. To be called “thin,” in much of the Western world, is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Though studies have shown that those with an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) have a higher mortality rate, the health concerns of overweight and obese people are highly complex.\n\n(The BMI is a calculation to determine if someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. Even though there are huge problems and limitations of using BMI to measure for “ideal” weight, doctors, scientists, and researchers continue to use it. Because of the BMI’s ubiquity in the scientific and medical literature, its classifications are common definitions of “fat,” and therefore used in this article.)\n\nTo be fair, King’s livelihood depends on an industry that is regulating her body out of it. Even if your work promotes fantastical and unrealistic ideals for the female form, that is a bitter pill to swallow. But as with any privilege, it’s difficult for those favored to see their advantages. Privilege doesn’t protect anyone, King included, from personal upsets, hardship, or traumas. Privilege, by definition, incurs more advantages, more opportunities, the benefit of the doubt, and quicker recovery from setbacks.\n\nBeing fat, on the other hand, is more likely to hurt your career, wealth, mental health, and love life. To conflate “skinny shaming” and “fat shaming” is to obscure the real shame in that.\n\nBeing overweight makes it harder to get a job\n\nAlmost half of employers in a survey said they were less inclined to recruit a candidate at the interview stage if the applicant was obese. (Reuters/Jacky Naegelen)\n\nUK-based Crossland Employment Solicitors polled people with hiring responsibilities at 1,000 employers in 2015 and found that almost half of those surveyed (45%) said they were less inclined to recruit a candidate at the interview stage if the applicant was obese. “They wouldn’t be able to do the job required” and “they’re lazy” were just two of the reasons cited.\n\nA 2016 study by psychologist Stuart W. Flint of Britain’s Sheffield Hallam University found that obese women were less likely to be hired than obese men, and both groups were at a disadvantage to thinner people because employers believed the obese were “less physically capable and slothful.” In 2009, Dan-Olof Rooth of Kalmar University in Swedensent fake applications to real job openings, using pairs of photos of the same person but digitally altered them to look more or less obese. He found that the callback response for obese women was eight percentage points lower than their thinner counterparts.\n\nBeing overweight makes it harder to get a promotion\n\nIn a 2016 study, Eden King of George Mason University and others showed that being overweight has an adverse impact on the perceived leadership performance of top managers. The larger the waist, the more it undermines evaluations of leadership ability, therefore hurting the chances of a promotion.\n\nWhat’s more, a study Eva Muenster of the University of Mainz and others showed that overweight and obese people believe their jobs are at risk more than those who are thin. “Job insecurity might lead employees into a vicious cycle,” the researchers wrote in a paper published in 2011. “Job insecurity might represent an important psychological burden which again might trigger obesity and other diseases.”\n\nOverweight women are more likely to earn less\n\nA 2004 study by John Cawley of Cornell University found that a 65-pound weight gain in white women was associated with a 9% drop in wages. The effect of weight on other gender-ethnic group combinations were not as statistically significant.\n\nA study by Jennifer Shinall at Vanderbilt Law School, meanwhile, revealed in 2014 that overweight women are “more likely to work in lower-paying and more physically demanding jobs; less likely to get higher-wage positions that include interaction with the public; and make less money in either case compared to average size women and all men.”\n\nThe system is stacked against the overweight from the beginning\n\nOverweight or obese young people are likely to experience psychological problems. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid)\n\nOverweight people don’t just have to fight the system during their working life; the battles start in childhood. A 2005 study led by Janet Latner of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand showed children and adolescents are less accepting of overweight and obese peers than adults.\n\nBefore reaching adulthood, overweight or obese young people are likely to experience psychological problems, such as depression and low self-esteem. A 2015 study led by Tilda Farhat of the US National Institutes of Health hammered home just how much overweight and obese people are set up to be vulnerable later in life:\n\nOverweight status in adolescence has been associated with sexual risk behavior (Akers et al., 2009), social exclusion (Chen & Brown, 2005), peer victimization (Pearce et al., 2002), and a lower likelihood of establishing romantic relationships (Chen & Brown, 2005; Halpern, King, Oslak, & Richard Udry, 2005; Pearce et al., 2002), all developmental milestones particularly salient for adolescence.\n\nAnd there is respite when overweight people start dating. The pool of people they are likely to get to know intimately is shallow, and the relationships they fall into have a higher chance of being abusive.\n\nThe non-thin are told every waking moment they’re not ideal\n\nThe weight loss industry is worth $60 billion a year in the US alone. (Reuters/Danny Moloshok)\n\nThey may have to endure the occasional request to “eat a hamburger,” but at least skinny people do not wake up every day constantly being told that they need to change themselves, unless they are clinically underweight, which can lead to weakened immune systems, fragile bones, and organ failure.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that the overweight are trying to take up less space in the world. In popular entertainment, there’s the fat best friend trope, who usually provides comic relief or is simply a bit crazy. And there’s often only room for one or two token big girls, epitomized by Taylor Swift and her “girl squad” tacking on Lena Dunham in the role of the token one that does not look like a catwalk model.\n\nSo the next time someone tries to appropriate the term “body shaming” to equate it to “skinny shaming,” remember it isn’t the same and that thin privilege is very real. In fact, as many doctors and scientists have pointed out, discriminating against fat people is the last form of acceptable social bias.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "College freshmen turn to empathic people during stressful times, research shows.\n\n“The transition to college can be tumultuous,” says Jamil Zaki, an assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University and coauthor of the study. “Whom you end up making friendships with can play a significant role in how you’ll deal with the stress and hardship of freshman year.”\n\nA 2008 poll conducted by the Associated Press and mtvU found that 40% of college students said they felt stress regularly—and almost one in five seriously considered dropping out of school.\n\nWith those high stress levels in mind, the researchers, including Stanford economics professor Matthew Jackson and former Stanford doctoral candidate Desmond Ong, put nearly 200 Stanford freshmen—who had recently moved into first-year dorms—through a battery of personality tests and questionnaires. Students also answered questions related to social networks within their dorms, for example, “Who usually makes you feel positive?” or “Who do you turn to when something bad happens?”\n\nTheir goal was to determine which students occupied central roles in these different networks—notably groups based on trust, fun, and excitement. The researchers found that individuals were more particular about whom they included in their trust networks compared to groups related to fun and excitement. In those selective trust networks, freshmen were more likely to include highly empathic students.\n\nIn contrast, when students wanted to feel positive and have fun, they were more likely to seek out dorm mates high in happiness. This suggests that students’ personalities are related to the different roles that they play in supporting their communities.\n\n“What we find here is not only that people’s networks of fun-based friendships are denser than their more trust- and stress-based networks,” Jackson says, “but also that more central people in a network have personalities that match the purpose of that network in intuitive ways. ”\n\nJust as you need the right outfit for a particular occasion, college freshmen need certain friends for certain situations.\n\nWhen you need a dose of fun, engaging with a positive and happy friend can lift your mood. But that friend may not be the best person to go to when you need someone to confide in. An empathic friend, on the other hand, may be just the right person for helping you through difficult and challenging times.\n\n“Empathic individuals were more likely to help their dorm mates and provide support during difficult times,” says Sylvia Morelli, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and lead author of the study. “These freshmen became magnets for close relationships in their new dorms.”\n\n“Empathic people are the ears and shoulders of these communities,” Zaki says.\n\nThis research shows that people know the difference between these two types of individuals. They spend time with individuals high in positive emotion, but target empathic individuals when they are stressed.\n\n“The study offers an opportunity for college students to examine their own relationships,” says Morelli, a former postdoctoral fellow in Stanford’s Social Neuroscience Lab, “especially against the landscape of social media where they can have seemingly countless ‘friends’ across the country and the world. Our work suggests that people will turn to only a small handful of these friends when things get stressful, and that they will trust their friends who show empathy and concern.”\n\nAn additional coauthor of the study is Rucha Makati of the University of Illinois at Chicago. The National Institute of Mental Health, the National Science Foundation, and an A*STAR National Science Scholarship supported the work.\n\nThis article was originally published in Futurity.

          "description": "Today, we’re talking about the most perfect cookware material on Earth: stainless steel. Before you smash that comment button, I want to make it clear that I’m not disparaging cast iron. I would never do such a thing. My 12-inch cast iron skillet is my very large, heavy son and I love him dearly (he turned 8 in July, thank you for asking). Here’s the truth, though: stainless steel is the only truly all-purpose cookware material you can buy, which is why I recommend it above all others.\n\nIt Just Works\n\nEven, Responsive Heat\n\nStainless steel’s amazing versatility lies in its responsiveness to heat adjustments. Cast iron delivers beautifully consistent cooking temperatures, but it takes forever to adapt to temperature changes. A well-constructed stainless pan distributes heat evenly and releases it quickly enough to take a covered pot of rice from a rolling boil to a low simmer without boiling over or scorching the bottom.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xhDzN3\n\nCracked has rounded up five simple things bad cooks (or cooking newbies) do wrong, and among them…\n\nRead more\n\nNon-Corrosive and Oven-Safe\n\nWhen it comes to stew, there’s no substitute for a long, slow oven braise—and there’s no better vessel for that than a covered stainless steel pan. This is especially true for something acidic like bolognese sauce, which you can’t safely cook in cast iron or aluminum. My personal favorite pan for oven braises is the five-quart deep sauté pan I got in my Cook’s Standard set (which I’ll talk more about later). Its wide base makes it ideal for browning ingredients in a single layer, while its straight sides accommodate a surprising amount of food. Throw on a lid and it can go straight into the oven for a nice long braise, which brings me to my next point.\n\nMulti-Use Lids\n\nI love my cast iron skillet with a fierceness matched only by my hatred for its awful hat. Trying to find a place to put down an oven-hot, dripping-with-condensation cast iron lid so you can check on your stew is a huge pain. Cleaning one, and then finding a place for it to dry, is even worse. Stainless steel lids are oven-safe too, but they’re lightweight, easy to maneuver, and dishwasher-friendly. Plus, there’s often some overlap with pan diameters in stainless sets, so one lid fits two or more pots. Finally, I love how easy they are to store — I use an IKEA accordion rack and it’s perfect.\n\nDurable and Easy to Clean\n\nThe difference between a chef and a cook is access to a dishwasher (the human, not the machine). If you’re in charge of your own cleanup, you need cookware that can be cleaned quickly, easily, and on your schedule. Unlike cast iron, non-stick, and carbon-steel pans, stainless ticks every one of these boxes and you can put it in the damn dishwasher (the machine, not the human; the latter is assault). Should you burn something on that’s not responding to a regular soap-and-water scrub, don’t panic, because God gave us Barkeeper’s Friend for exactly this reason.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2ueCsOI\n\nIn the abstract—which is to say, if you were an extremely rich person with an army of servants to…\n\nRead more\n\nThere’s Nothing it Can’t Do\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, stainless steel is truly all-purpose, but it does some things exceptionally well. Here are my favorite applications.\n\nPan-Frying\n\nWhen used properly, a stainless steel skillet is the best pan-frying surface, period. It’s nonstick enough for perfect softly-scrambled eggs, yet sticky enough to facilitate the all-important Maillard reaction. The secret is to preheat your pan at the desired heat for a few minutes before adding the fat, then heat the fat in the hot pan for an additional minute or two. (This works at any temperature.) When you’ve got a hot stainless steel skillet coated with hot fat, nothing will stick to it—not even fried cheese.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2ydUPlM\n\nWhen I first started cooking for myself and others, I considered a steak dinner to be the epitome…\n\nRead more\n\nBoiling and Steaming\n\nA good stock pot is a true kitchen workhorse. Whether you’re boiling three pounds of pasta, simmering a gallon of Sunday gravy, or steaming up some artichokes, a stainless stock pot will get the job done right.\n\nBraising\n\nI already talked a little bit about how much I love using a big stainless sauté pan for slow-roasted stews, but a covered stainless pan is also excellent for quick stovetop braises. The lids I waxed poetic about earlier are the true stars here: they make braising super-easy.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xjkJoU\n\nBraising or pot roasting is a great technique for making meat more tender. If you braise the meat…\n\nRead more\n\nIt Costs Whatever You Can Afford\n\nHigh-quality stainless steel can be found in every price range. The only kind you want is “clad” or “multi-ply,” which means it’s made from multiple layers of metal. Super-fancy clad stainless uses a copper core for heat conduction; less-expensive models generally use an aluminum core. As long as you look for heavy-bottomed, multi-ply, all-stainless construction, you can’t go wrong. Here are some recommendations to get you started.\n\nBourgie\n\nIf price is no object, All-Clad is the gold standard of stainless cookware. A ten-piece copper-core set costs about $1300; a fourteen-piece set is just under $2000. Believe it or not, you can spend even more if you want—check out Alessi pans for some real cookware porn—but I don’t condone spending thousands of dollars on cookware. Buy a reasonably-priced used car or contribute to your IRA instead, for Pete’s (or your own) sake.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2cwC2qQ\n\nDespite their high price tags, All-Clad Tri-Ply skillets are among the most popular pieces of…\n\nRead more\n\nMedium-Bourgie\n\nBoth Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table make excellent cookware under their house brands, and Calphalon and Anolon both offer very good multi-ply stainless sets. Steer clear of the reasonably priced “Classic Stainless” sets you find in department stores, though: they lack the multi-ply construction and heft that makes a great pan.\n\nBudget\n\nShould the dystopian hellscape that is late-stage capitalism provide you no options outside of ethically-questionable Chinese knockoffs, I highly recommend a Cook’s Standard set. I’ve used mine daily for five years and it shows zero wear and tear. It was also less than two hundred dollars, but I have no plans to upgrade.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xiFYHs\n\nDear Lifehacker, I've had the same pots and pans for years. Some of it's starting to look …\n\nRead more\n\nVery Tight Budget\n\nIf you know what to look for, Goodwill and other thrift stores can be treasure troves. My best tip for cookware thrifting is to Google makes and models on your phone right there in the store before buying. You probably won’t find a full matching set, and you’ll absolutely have to rifle through piles of terrible thin-bottomed pots, but you also might find a really nice Calphalon pan for five bucks.\n\nWhen it comes to versatility, durability, and functionality, stainless steel is truly unmatched. If you’ve ever passed on stainless in favor of other cookware, I hope this inspires you to take a second look. You won’t regret it.\n",

          "description": "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) isn’t given to analyzing financial fads. Based in Basel, Switzerland, it’s a “bank for central banks,” so it’s usually concerned about things like the stability of the global financial system.\n\nIn its latest quarterly review, though, it reached out to an area of technology that has so far been reserved for financial technologists and speculators pushing libertarian philosophies. The bank’s paper on cryptocurrencies is a great explainer on how cryptocurrencies intersect with central banks, a topic that’s gaining currency as institutions from the Bank of England to the Monetary Authority of Singapore try to digitize cash using blockchain technology.\n\nThe BIS paper lays out the two main uses for a central bank-issued cryptocurrency: It could be a type of decentralized digital cash for consumers; or a tool to streamline settlements of transactions between financial institutions. The authors, Morten Linnemann Bech, from the bank’s committee on payments and market infrastructures, and Rodney Garratt, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, use a “money flower” schematic to disentangle the myriad terms that people throw around when they talk about digital currencies and payments.\n\nThe past, present, and future of money. (Bank for International Settlements)\n\nThe BIS paper shows that a central bank-issued cryptocurrency could well be a way to digitize cash, while crucially preserving the privacy of users, which cash already does. If central banks issue digital cash this way, it would cut out commercial banks, who are currently intermediaries for consumers to obtain central bank-issued money.\n\nThis “retail” use of a central bank digital currency is particularly pressing in countries with rapidly falling cash usage, such as Sweden, the authors say. Central banks also have good reason to use a digital currency in the wonkier, “wholesale” context, where it’s used exclusively by other banks. This upgrade payment systems that will soon be obsolete, and which depend on database designs that are “no longer fit for purpose,” the authors write.\n\nIn any case, central banks must reckon with digital currencies: “All central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale [digital currencies] makes sense in their own context,” the authors write.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Some of the most impressive buildings and cities ever made by humans can be found in Africa: the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe in South Africa, Kenya’s Gedi Ruins and Meroe in Sudan. Perhaps the most awe-inspiring of these are the last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Great Pyramid of Giza, in Egypt.\n\nThis should come as no surprise. Africa has an extensive archaeological record, extending as far back as 3.3 million years ago when the first-ever stone tool was made in what is today Kenya. The continent’s cultural complexity and diversity is well established; it is home to the world’s oldest-known pieces of art. And, of course, it is the birth place of modern humans’ ancient ancestors, Homo sapiens.\n\nDespite all this evidence, some people still refuse to believe that anyone from Africa (or anywhere in what is today considered the developing world) could possibly have created and constructed the Giza pyramids or other ancient masterpieces. Instead, they credit ancient astronauts, extraterrestrials or time travellers as the real builders.\n\nWell, you may ask, so what? Who cares if relatively few people don’t believe the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids? What’s the harm? Actually, there is great harm: firstly, these people try to prove their theories by travelling the world and desecrating ancient artefacts. Secondly, they perpetuate and give air to the racist notion that only Europeans – white people – ever were and ever will be capable of such architectural feats.\n\nA threat to world heritage\n\nIn 2014 two German pseudo-scientists set out to “prove” that academics were concealing the Giza pyramids’ “real” origin. To do so, they chiselled off a piece of one of the pyramids—of course, without authorisation, so they could “analyse” it.\n\nAliens? Really? (Reuters/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah)\nAnd earlier in 2017 scientists from the World Congress on Mummy Studies in South America published a communique on their Facebook page to draw attention to the raiding of Nazca graves for a pseudo-scientific research programme called the Alien project. It insists that aliens rather than ancient Peruvians were responsible for the famous geoglyphs called the Nazca Lines, despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\nSuch incidents exemplify the threats to developing nations’ cultural heritage. Conservation authorities around the world must spend a great deal of money to protect and restore unique pieces of heritage, and to guard them against vandalism. For instance, the most recent overhaul planned for the Giza site—back in 2008—was estimated at a cost of $45 million.\n\nThese are not wealthy nations, as a rule, and it costs money they often don’t have to repair the damage done by, among others, pseudo-scientists.\n\nRacism and colonial attitudes\n\nA series of stone circles in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province provides an excellent example of the other problem with pseudo-archaeologists. Some people genuinely believe that these structures were designed by aliens. They scoff at scientific research that proves the stone circles were made by the Koni people using ropes, sticks and wood. They will not even entertain the notion that ancient African tribes could be responsible.\n\nBut the same people have no problem believing that medieval Europeans built the continent’s magnificent cathedrals using only ropes, sticks and wood. They dismiss scientific research that overwhelmingly proves ancient Africans’ prowess, but insist the documents which contain evidence of Europeans’ construction processes are beyond reproach.\n\nThe Mapungubwe rhinoceros was hidden for decades. (Reuters/Andrew Heavens)\nWhy is it so hard for some to acknowledge that ancient non-European civilisations like the Aztecs, people from Easter Island, ancient Egyptians or Bantu-speakers from southern Africa could create intricate structures?\n\nThe answer is unfortunately as simple as it seems: it boils down to profound racism and a feeling of white superiority that emanates from the rotting corpse of colonialism.\n\nColonial powers saw their “subjects” in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia as exotic, fascinating—but ultimately primitive.\n\nAn increasing knowledge and understanding of the archaeological record mostly dispelled these notions. But for some, and until nowadays, it seems unthinkable that ancient non-European societies have been resourceful and creative enough to erect such monuments. So, the thinking went, conventional science must have been missing or hiding something: ancient astronauts, aliens, or the lost civilisation of Atlantis. Even some mainstream scholars have dabbled in this thinking.\n\nTelling the truth\n\nThe internet and social media has given these modern conspiracy junkies a perfect platform to share their theories. They try to make others believe that scientists are hiding “the truth” about ancient monuments. Sometimes they even succeed.\n\nThere is a risk that they will drown out quality knowledge and science with their colourful, outlandish theories. When such bizarre theories emerge, it can water down people’s understanding and appreciation of Africa’s architectural and cultural heritage.\n\nAt the same time, these theories can prevent awareness about Africa’s rich heritage from developing. The heirs of the real builders may never learn about their ancestors’ remarkable achievements.\n\nScientists have a crucial role to play in turning the tide on such harmful theories. Those of us who are doing ongoing research around the continent’s architectural and fossil record should be sharing our findings in a way that engages ordinary people.\n\nWe must show them just how awe-inspiring structures like Great Zimbabwe, Meroe and the Giza Pyramids are – not because they were created by some alien race, but because they are living proof of ancient societies’ ingenuity.\n\nJulien Benoit, Postdoc in Vertebrate Palaeontology, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

          "description": "Once upon a time I went through a breakup and it sucked very much, thank you. We’d been living together for five years, and when it came time to figure out where I wanted to live next, I realized that I didn’t want to commit to an apartment, a city, or even a state. So, instead, I bought a van. It was a 2006 Freightliner Sprinter that was already converted into a small Class B RV by Gulf Stream, model name Vista Cruiser G24. After five months of exhaustive research, it was the only van I could find that had the exact layout I was looking for.\n\nBut as a writer that covers a lot of tech and gadgets, I knew that if I wanted to be able to continue working from the road (mandatory), I was going to have to make some modifications so it could keep up with my geeky lifestyle. And if I was going to be living in it full time, I wanted it to have as many creature comforts as possible. So I made some upgrades. A lot of upgrades. By the time I hit the road on July 15th, 2015 for a road trip that I would call Connected States, my van (Ashley “The Beast”) was properly equipped, and it’s continued to evolve.\n\nI’m now more than two years in and I’ve learned a lot over that time. The following is my list of the best gear for #vanlife.\n\nNote: because the van I ended up buying was already converted, it already had the basics included. We’re talking about a bed, a fridge and microwave, a toilet, shower, and sink, plus holding tanks for fresh, gray, and black water. These things are obviously important but the focus of this piece is on upgrades beyond the basics.\n\nFirst step: Power up\n\nThe first and largest upgrade I made was an overhaul the electrical system. It was the single most expensive addition, but also the most worth it. (This upgrade cost about one-fifth of what I paid for the van itself. Ouch.) Because this dealt with drilling, running wires behind panels, and things that could catch fire and/or explode if done improperly, I decided to have professionals do it, and I took the van to AM Solar in Springfield, OR. They were reputed to be the best in all the forums I’d read, and they did not disappoint.\n\nThey managed to squeeze two 160 watt solar panels onto my roof, for a total of 320 watts. Not at all bad for a smaller rig. The power runs down into an extremely beefy 3000 watt hybrid Magnum Energy inverter/charger, and then into a custom built 200 amp-hour lithium battery array. This might sound like overkill, but it wasn’t.\n\nThe “house battery” (i.e. the battery for living, not for the engine) that my van came with was a standard, 80aH AGM battery. They’re cheaper, but once you drain them past 50 percent there’s a serious voltage-drop and you risk damaging the battery, so you really only get 40 usable amp-hours. Lithium batteries, while very pricey, are not only more power-dense, but you can drain them as far as 20 or even 10 percent before you get much voltage drop, and you aren’t likely to damage them. That means that now I had more like 160-180 usable amp-hours of energy per charge, and it fit in the same space as the old AGM battery.\n\nLithium also charges quicker (it can pull up to 80 amps from the alternator when my engine is running) and can let out its juice faster, too, which is where that big 3,000-watt inverter comes in. Before, if I wanted to microwave something or even use the van’s hot water heater for a shower, I either had to be plugged into shore power (which I rarely am) or using my noisy propane generator, which isn’t exactly incognito. Now I can run either appliance, and keep all of my gadgets charged via AC outlets, off of the battery, completely silently. It was a total game-changer.\n\nGetting connected\n\nAs someone who works on the internet, having reliable internet access is kinda important. Fast 4G mobile internet is one of the primary reasons why there are so many #vanlifers these days. I’ve driven more than 60,000 miles, zigzagging around the U.S. and two products have served me extremely well. The first is the Verizon Jetpack MiFi 6620L which has covered me just about everywhere in the country for most of the first two years of this journey. For basically everywhere else, I’m using the ZTE Falcon Z-917 on T-Mobile’s network, which has delivered solid speeds even in squirrely canyons. Both seem to have stronger antennas and deliver faster data speeds compared to phones on the same networks.\n\nThese devices have a bit of help, too. I’ve been using the WeBoost Drive 4G-X signal booster. A small antenna magnetically attaches to the roof of the van and connects to a box (which I’ve now permanently wall-mounted), that plugs into a DC outlet. It isn’t night and day, but it typically adds 1-2 bars of reception when it’s turned on, so I basically just always leave it on. When I was in Big Bend National Park in Texas I had zero reception. When I turned it on I got one bar, which was enough to make a phone call and text my family back home. The only times I had no signal from either Verizon or T-Mobile and the WeBoost didn’t help was when I was in extremely remote areas or deep into National Parks.\n\nIf things get really desperate, I have the Garmin inReach Explorer+ satellite communicator. Not only does it have offline topographic maps, but it allows me to send and receive text messages via satellite. There’s also an SOS button you can hit which will immediately send in search and rescue no matter where you are. I also carry this with me whenever I’m hiking or mountain biking alone. I consider it a good insurance policy.\n\nI’ve shuffled phones a few times but for the last year I’ve been using the Google Pixel XL with a Verizon SIM, and it’s been extremely solid. It’s fast, battery life is reliable, and the photos it takes are unbeatable amongst phones. I also have a T-Mobile SIM which I swap in when needs be.\n\nLocking it down\n\nSo, I’ve got a fair amount of gadgets in here and I’m often out of the van exploring, and/or parking in unfamiliar neighborhoods, so I need to keep my stuff and myself safe. So I got a top-of-the-line security system from Viper. This included the 5806 system, plus GPS SmartStart. It’s a two-way system so if my alarm goes off my keychain will ring even if I’m up to a mile away and I’ll get an alert on my phone, even if I’m across the country.\n\nIt also has a microphone so it can detect the sound of shattering glass. It adds an extra layer of security, but it’s made for a few humorous moments. Apparently, my sneeze sound like glass breaking, as does accidentally dropping my keys on the floor. The smartphone app isn’t a gimmick either. I can see exactly where I parked and even unlock the van for a friend to grab something when I’m elsewhere. It also lets me start the van remotely, which is nice in winter.\n\nBut even with that killer security system, I wanted some extra protection. So I completely dismantled one of my precious cabinets and I installed the Viking Security Safe VS-38BL with biometric fingerprint scanner. It’s big enough to fit my laptop, cameras, hard drives, and microphones, no problem. I’ve also installed it in such a way that there’s no way to get it out of the van without completely disassembling the bed, which would take a lot of time. The fingerprint scanner is kind of excessive, but hey, it’s supposed to be a teched-out van so I decided to go all in, and it does make it easier to open in the dark.\n\nIf things ever get really dire, I have this flashlight: the Vipertek VTS-195. It has a powerful 400 lumen beam. Oh and it’s also a stun gun capable of delivering a 25,000,000 volt zap (though, interestingly enough, the company has stopped listing the voltage since I purchased it). I can confirm that getting shocked with it really, really hurts a lot. I also have a Louisville Slugger, should a low-tech option be necessary.\n\nBoom Boom\n\nFor the installation of the Viper system I went to All Pro Audio in Santa Clara, CA, and I started talking with owner Jim Lee about audio stuff. See, I really wanted a system that could run Android Auto, but all Android Auto capable systems required a double-DIN slot, which is the taller, closer-to-square slot for a car stereo. My van had a single-din slot, so I thought I was out of luck. Jim said, “Y’know, we could cut open your dash to expand the slot…” Oh hell yes.\n\nI went with the Pioneer AVIC-8100NEX— the flagship at the time — which is capable of running both Android Auto and Apple Car Play. It has a capacitive touch screen, and it works with a backup cam, which I had Jim install, too. (Backing The Beast up is a lot less stressful now). The whole install matches the rest of my dash perfectly, and being able to use Google Maps and stream music as I make my way across the country has been great.\n\nJim noted that I was going to have this nice new stereo head but it would be running through two wimpy speakers built into the dash. Those speakers produced almost zero bass. I told him I’d been thinking of installing a self-powered subwoofer called the Kicker BassStation under the table behind the driver’s seat, so we did that. Then, during the installation he called me and said there’s actually room for two more speakers at the base of the captain’s chairs.\n\nI had him pop in a pair of Phoenix Gold 6x9 RX speakers. The result? I now have way more sound than I need, and I’ve gone mad with power. It’s not an audiophile-grade system, but I’m really impressed with the sound for the price. My audio engineer friend Greg Sextro even made me a custom EQ setting, tuning the system to the resonant frequency of the van’s interior. It sounds fantastic and listening to music is now pure joy.\n\nThe capper was that Jim’s team built a fake faceplate for the stereo to make it look old and junky and less theft-worthy. It’s one of my very favorite upgrades.\n\nMood Lighting\n\nThe van came with a whole bunch of small incandescent bulbs and a few fluorescent tubes. The incandescents get hot and suck a fair amount of power. So I took a quick trip to an RV supply store in Santa Cruz, CA and managed to find replacement LEDs in all the right sizes. The fluorescent replacements took a bit of rewiring (thanks for the help, dad!) but it was pretty simple. The interior is now brighter yet it uses about one fifth the amount of energy.\n\nThe only problem is that bright LEDs are can be harsh and not great for relaxing, so I leveled-up in a big way and installed Phillips Hue LightStrips in a ring around the ceiling. Not only does this give me even lighting throughout the interior, but I can change the lights to any color I want or even put it in disco mode with a third-party app. It wasn’t trivial to rig it up for mobile life because my 4G hotspots don’t have Ethernet ports, which you need to connect the Hue hub to. So I had to install a D-Link DAP 1650 Extender and Access Point. Basically, it acted as a repeater for my hotspot’s Wi-Fi, and I could plug the hub into it. Once I had that set up I installed the Hue Dimmer Switch and the Hue Tap Switch (both of which work when the system is offline) so I could change color modes without needing Wi-Fi to be on every time. Basically, it was a pain in the ass to set up, but it was beyond worth it. It’s amazing how much that has changed the look and feel of the van.\n\nMiscellaneous Miracles\n\nBecause my van was already converted it already had an AC/DC fridge, a microwave, and a two-burner propane stove, so it’s pretty well set-up for cooking, and I’d say I make about 75-percent of my meals in the van (which helps me eat cheaper and healthier while on the road). It isn’t without its challenges, though. With cabinet space at a premium I’ve experimented with a number of coffee-making systems over the last two years. It started out with a French press, which was kind of bulky and took a lot of precious water to clean. Eventually I discovered this amazing Better Housewares Collapsible Tea Kettle, which I instantly feel in love with. It hardly takes up any space, and allows me to make pour-overs. I experimented with a couple mesh systems from Bodum, but they too took up a ton of space and were also tough to clean. Finally I discovered this Snow Peak Folding Coffee Pour Over Brewer, which is made of stainless steel and folds away into nothing. I use biodegradable #2 coffee filters, so there’s basically no cleanup, it takes up hardly any space, and it makes killer coffee.\n\nI also have a Joule Sous Vide by Chef Steps. Because it’s small and this is a high-tech van so why the hell not.\n\nThe number one pain-point of vanlife is finding a place to park. Sometimes you end up parking pretty far from where you want to be. Because of that I wanted a folding bike, so I could keep it safely inside my trunk space, but also one that was tough enough to handle single-track. Enter the Montague Swissbike X90. It has full 26-inch wheels as well as very cushy front suspension, and it sets up and breaks down in a hurry. I’ve taken it on trails in Moab, Marquette, Giant Sequoia National Monument, and many other places and I’m always amazed at how well it handles. I added Shimano XTR M9020 Trail SPD pedals so I could ride with or without bike shoes. Montague has a new model out with 27.5-inch wheels I’m dying to try.\n\nI’ve tested more than a dozen different backpacks over the last couple years, and the one I keep coming back to is the Mountainsmith Borealis. It’s the first backpack I’ve found that has ample (padded) room for my cameras, lenses, and mics, but also plenty of space for food, clothes, and even a sleeping bag and pad. It has a built-in rain-cover, a separate laptop sleeve, ample padding for the hips, and it fits under most airplane seats. If I’m actually backpacking backpacking, though, I use the Gregory Baltoro 75, which is well laid-out, has a ton of space, and there’s even a built-in 7-watt Goal Zero solar panel for gadget charging. For a quick hike or snowboarding at a resort I use the Eddie Bauer Bacon Pack which is super light, hydration-bladder compatible, and has nice organization and plenty of room for a day’s recreation.\n\nI’m also using a the Peak Design Clip Pro, which I can attach to the strap of any backpack (or belt), and allows me to hike with my camera out, without it constantly bashing into my sternum. I’ve only had it for a few weeks and I don’t know how I went the last two years without it.\n\nBasically, any item you select for your van needs to be evaluated for its versatility. One of the advantages of #vanlife is being able to be on the beach during one season, and in the mountains the next. I knew I could only fit one surfboard in the trunk, so I went with a 5’ 8” Rusty DWART which is a shape that can handle an extremely wide variety of waves. It’s made with Varial foam, which not only makes it stronger, but gives it way more float for its diminutive size. For a snowboard (which I only travel with during winter) I got a custom stick from Wagner Custom Skis. They don’t even advertise that they make boards, but they’re happy to do one for you, and they’re incredible. Every one is custom-made, so mine is built for my height, weight, and riding style, and I had them design a shape that can twist through trees but still float over powder. I even got one of my own photos put on the deck. I pair it with The Ride 92 snowboard boots, which are incredibly comfy, offer great tread, and look cool at the bar.\n\nVersatility translates to the things you wear, too. I need to give a special mention to what I consider the best shoes I’ve ever owned: the Keen’s Glenhaven Mid. They comfortable, quick to put on because of the bungee laces, and the look good pretty much everywhere. I’ve worn them to important meetings, on dates, and just walking around cities. It looks like the Mid is being discontinued, which breaks my heart, but there’s a new lower-cut version I’m hoping will prove just as worthy. The applies to exercise, too. For a while I had two pairs of running shoes: One for street and one for trail. Eventually, I found the Altra Lone Peak 2.5, which work incredibly well for both. They have wide toe boxes, they’re zero drop, and have excellent tread and padding. They have become my all-time favorite running shoe.\n\nThis may seem like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference. A lot of vans and RVs have ceiling fans (usually made by Fantastic or MaxxFan). They’re indispensable for getting hot air (or cooking smells) out, and it’s a safe way to leave a window open. My recommendation is to get a plastic cover for you fan, like the one you see here. Yes, they’re dorky-looking, but it gives you the ability to keep your fan open and running even when it’s raining, which is often when it’s muggiest. You can leave you fan door open and explore the city without worrying about a sudden thunderstorm. It’s a great addition.\n\nWhen Stuff Breaks\n\nWhen things break, you need to have some tools handy. My number-one most-used tool is the Leatherman Wave multi-tool which I’ve been using for more than a decade now. For bigger jobs, I grabbed a soft-bag toolkit from Denali, which was cheap and is easily shoved into a cabinet, but it has a wide variety of things one might need. For drilling and screwdriving, I’ve been extremely happy with the Porter Cable Max Compact Lithium Drill/Driver. It’s small and light, but it has plenty of torque and fantastic battery-life.\n\nFor cleaning up, I’ve been heavily reliant on the Black + Decker 20V Max Lithium Flex Vac. It’s small enough to pack into a little cabinet, but it offers excellent suction, and the detachable hose is critical for getting into tight spaces, which a converted van is full of. I also use a ton of Gorilla Tape (and Gorilla Clear Repair Tape) for quick fixes, and I end up velcroing a lot of things to walls (notice my velcro shoe rack in the photo of the speakers above).\n\nWork Tools\n\nLastly, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the stuff I’ve been using for work. I have an aging MacBook Pro which I’m hoping will last me a bit longer. For external hard drives I’ve been using the Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Slim in the 2TB flavor. I’ve found them to be fast and reliable and they can fit in my jeans pocket. They haven’t let me down yet (knock wood).\n\nFor camera, I’ve got the Sony A7S, which is a small and lightweight full-frame mirrorless camera that’s unbeatable in low-light (except by Sony’s own A7S II and the A9). It’s gotten me the best Milky Way shots of my life. My go-to drone for aerial shots has been the DJI Phantom 3 Pro, but I’m probably going to swap it for the smaller DJI Mavic Pro soon, simply because it’s so much more packable. Hell, it would even fit in my safe.\n\nI use a GoPro Hero5 Black for a rugged solution I can just throw in my pocket (or stick on my helmet or surfboard) when I’m about to do something stupid. It also acts as my video journal of the whole road trip, thanks to a sticky mount I attached to my dashboard. It shoots killer wide-angle footage, it’s waterproof as is, and the built-in screen is nice for quickly framing a shot. I’ve also been messing with the Karma Grip stabilizer while snowboarding, mountain biking, and just trying to get smooth handheld panning shots, and found that in general it works really well.\n\nFor capturing audio, I use a Zoom H6 as my go-to digital recorder and a Blue Yeti Pro USB mic for all of my voice-recording needs. Between the two I’ve been able to record voiceovers for TV pilots, podcasts, as well as the occasional song, and the quality has never let me down. When I’m recording on location I use a pair of aging Sennheiser G2 wireless lavalier mics. If you’re looking, you’ll want the newer G3 system. For monitoring (and listening to music in general), I’ve been using the Sennheiser Urbanite on-ear headphones. They have very nicely-balanced sound, a built-in mic, and they aren’t insanely expensive. You can see all three of these items in the video above.\n\nThere are tons of other little tweaks and additions I’ve made over the last two years, but these are the main tools that have really improved my vanlife. This was originally supposed to be a one-year project, but when I hit that point I realized that I didn’t want to stop, and I didn’t need to, in part because of all these additions. I may live in a small, mobile space, but I’ve found it to be surprisingly comfortable, and I’ve managed to stay productive despite the constant siren call of new experiences just outside my door. Currently, the plan is to keep going until it stops being fun or until I find something better. If you want to read more about life on the road, check out my blog for the trip at ConnectedStates.com. And if you have any questions hit me up on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook and I’ll do my best to answer them.\n\nPhotography by Brent Rose for The Verge.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

          "description": "For those who do not already have the Southwest Airlines Visa Credit Card: happy days are back again. Qualifying accounts who apply for the card can receive 60,000 Southwest Rapid Rewards points after spending $2,000 in the first 90 days from opening the card – an increase from the regular sign up bonus. To make things even better, the Southwest Airlines Visa Business Credit Card has the same bonus, offering qualified travelers up to 120,000 Rapid Rewards points towards their next trip.\n\nWhile Southwest may not come with all the amenities of our favorite carriers, flying aboard this low-cost carrier can be an easy and efficient way to see North America. If you have never considered giving the Southwest credit cards your attention, now may be the perfect time to do so. Here are the three reasons you may want to add at least one Southwest card to your wallet today.\n\nLow cost for award flights\n\nAlthough the cost of a Southwest flight can be comparable to those on a legacy carrier, the “Luv” airline makes up for it with some rather generous policies. This includes two free checked bags and no blackout dates on all of their flights.\n\nWhile Southwest prices Rapid Rewards flights based on the actual cost of a flight, studies show the award cost of a Southwest flight is significantly lower than those aboard the legacy carriers. In a 2015 survey, flights paid for in Southwest Rapid Rewards points cost an average of 9,497 rewards points – almost three times less than their legacy competition. Those applying for one of these cards for the Rapid Rewards alone could go a long way on 60,000 points.\n\nLow annual fee and anniversary miles\n\nTo make things better, the Southwest Airlines Visa credit card matches the low-cost mindset of the carrier. Those who find themselves loyal to the airline after using their Rapid Rewards points can keep the card with long-term benefits.\n\nThe $69 annual fee is lower than other airline credit cards, offering the opportunity to earn Rapid Rewards points at a low fee. Additionally, frugal travelers who keep this card receive 3,000 Rapid Rewards points every year on their anniversary, adding immediate value for the annual fee. The card also earns double points on Southwest Airlines purchases, getting them closer to their next free trip faster.\n\nThe Southwest Companion Pass\n\nArguably the most important benefit of applying for both cards is the Southwest Airlines Companion Pass. Often considered one of the best benefits in consumer aviation, the Companion pass allows travelers to fly a friend or family for free on the same itinerary, effectively turning every flight into a buy one, get one free promotion.\n\nTo earn the companion pass, flyers must earn 110,000 Southwest Rapid Rewards points in one calendar year by all means available: spending on the Southwest credit cards and flying aboard the carrier. By applying for the card with the 60,000 points bonus, travelers are halfway towards earning the companion pass. With both cards, travelers can earn the Companion pass by spending $4,000 in the first three months of opening the card.\n\nFor those who don’t have the Southwest card yet, now may be the time to strike. With plenty of upside, these cards can help travelers get to their next destination for a low overall price.\n\n \n\nAre you adding the Southwest Airlines credit cards to your wallet with this promotion? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!\n",

          "description": "Cairo\n\nFor generations, Mohammed Ahmed’s family made a living offering tourists visiting the Egyptian pyramids in Giza a ride on their gaily decorated horses. But in the years since the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, as arrivals dwindled from over 14 million in 2010 to just 9 million in 2015, Ahmed experienced a change of fortune. Fierce competition arose among the horsemen—and camel owners—for customers, and whatever fees and baksheesh they collected were not enough to pay bills or save for another day.\n\n“It’s been very tough for us,” Ahmed said on a recent sunny afternoon while eyeing a group of Chinese tourists alighting from a tour bus. “You cannot imagine how life has changed.”\n\nFor decades, Egypt was the main draw for international tourists visiting North Africa. But the country’s tourism industry has suffered a critical blow following a string of political misfortunes, a major airline disaster, terrorist attacks, and church bombings. The failed revolution of 2011 and the military’s violent reassertion of power dampened growth in the sector, sent tourists packing, and turned luxury resorts into abandoned “ghost hotels.” At one point in 2013, the political upheaval in the country was costing the tourism sector $400 million in monthly revenues, according to estimates from JP Morgan analysts.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated in 2015 after the Islamic State took responsibility for downing a Russian airliner over Sinai, killing all 224 people—most of them tourists—on board. Russia put an indefinite ban on all air travel to Egypt, while a number of European airlines and governments placed flight restrictions over security concerns. Terrorists also stabbed tourists in the Red Sea town of Hurghada, and gunmen opened fire on a tourist bus in Cairo. Deadly attacks on churches in the bustling seaport of Alexandria and the city of Tanta also put a dent on Egypt’s image as a favorite tourist destination.\n\nThe rubble from a blast inside the Islamic Art Museum. (Reuters/Mohamed Abd El Ghany)\n\nEgypt’s ancient sites, museums, and parks have also experienced trouble, with several of them looted, deserted and artifacts stolen. A car bombing also damaged the façade and exhibits at the Museum of Islamic Art in 2014, forcing it to close for up to two years.\n\nThe Aquarium Grotto Garden in Cairo, which was once home to a rare collection of African fishes, is now almost empty. On a recent visit, most of the water tanks were devoid of any aquatic life, and couples strolled in the grotto caves strewn with garbage and Cola cans.\n\nMost of the aquatic life has not been sustained at the Fish Garden in Cairo. (Photo/Abdi Latif Dahir)\n\nAll these negative trends have coalesced to harm tourism, significantly reducing international flight bookings to Egypt, and pushing visitors to look to countries like Spain as alternative holidaying destinations. The low number of inbound tourists has also affected the economy, which looks to the sector as a crucial source of hard currency. To augment this and to secure funding for research and restoration activities, the government increased ticket prices to enter these parks and museums. Egypt’s government also received a three-year, $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and devalued its currency by almost half against the dollars in order to combat the severe economic crisis,\n\nFor ordinary citizens like Ahmed, the devalued Egyptian pound has meant rising inflation rates and a weak purchasing power. “The currency means nothing,” Ahmed said. “You get it, you spend it, and then you have none of it.”\n\nGlimmer of hope\n\nFor the first time since the uprising, the government believes the number of tourists visiting Egypt in 2017 could come close to the levels seen before the 2011 revolution.\n\nTo stimulate growth, Egypt has been offering incentives and reducing levies for airlines and tour operators in order to bring more tourists into the country. The government, pressed hard with security reforms, has spent millions of dollars upgrading security at its airports. Officials have also publicized the high-profile visits by Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel and Hollywood star Will Smith to the pyramids as a way to boost the sagging tourism sector.\n\nThe government also launched a campaign dubbed Wahashtouna (“We have missed you” in Arabic) in order to attract more visitors from the Arabian Gulf. These Arab visitors have continued to boost hotel bookings in key tourist cities like Cairo, Hurghada, Sharm El Sheikh, and Alexandria, according to estate agency, Colliers International.\n\nBut before the tourism sector can revive from its current slump, its sluggish growth will continue to harm many people who depend on it for income. These include small hotel owners, tour guides, drivers, and souvenir shop owners who benefit from the streaming flock of tourists. Hossam Abdullahi, who had his horse-drawn carriage by the Sphinx, says he’s however optimistic about the future. “It’s going to take a long time before everything is fine,” Abdullahi said, “but we are patient. And the good days will come back God-willing.”\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Over the past few days, many blogs have covered a fire sale of sorts on the Amazon Fire tablets. Through a combination of being an Amazon Prime member and using at least 1 Amex Membership Rewards point, you can get a solid deal: an Amazon Fire 7 Tablet for $15 each or the Amazon Fire 8 Tablet for $25 each. Since those tablets normally sell for $50 / $80 respectively, this is a solid deal — really, just about any Android device with a 12 hour battery life and a mircoSD slot would be a deal at that price. The deal is limited to 5 per account, but Mark Ostermann at Miles to Memories reported yesterday that it is 5 per color. With the Fire 7 and Fire 8 coming in 4 colors each, that means you can theoretically buy 20 of each tablet, or 40 total tablets for $800 plus tax. I wouldn’t go quite that wild, but if you’re interested in a couple as gifts and maybe to resell locally, here’s how to do it.\n\nStep 1: Start at JetBlue\n\nYou should be able to earn 3 JetBlue TrueBlue points per dollar at Amazon on these purchases. Click here to go to JetBlue and get your link. Alternatively, some have said that Ibotta may be offering 5% back. I haven’t used Ibotta in a long time, so you’ll have to check there on your own. You could see our guide to Extreme Stacking Amazon and maybe there are some other options. If neither JetBlue miles nor Ibotta appeal to you, feel free to use our affiliate links to these tablets below with our thanks.\n\nStep 2: Add Fire to your cart\n\nThe following are our affiliate links to each color:\n\nFire 7 BlackFire 7 YellowFire 7 BlueFire 7 Red\n\nFire 8 BlackFire 8 YellowFire 8 BlueFire 8 Red\n\nI don’t believe you can mix and match Fire 7 and Fire 8 in a single Amazon order, but you can definitely mix and match colors of the same model. See below for screen shots of an order mixing yellow and red Fire 8’s.\n\nStep 3: De-register the device from your account\n\nAfter adding the Fire to your cart, there is the in-between step before proceeding to checkout. You can check the box to mark the tablet(s) as a gift here (and you should).\n\nThat’s important because if you don’t do it, the tablets will be registered to your Amazon account. If you’re not planning to keep them, you don’t want that. When you click the link that says “Why is this important?”, it explains:\n\nNote that if you forget to do this, Jen J. in our Frequent Miler Insiders Facebook group reports that chat support can de-register them for you after the fact. I forgot to do this last night when I was ordering and I chatted with support, but since my order had not yet shipped they weren’t yet able to help me with this yet.\n\nStep 4: Change your payment method to use Membership Rewards points (before you add a promo code)\n\nYou must next choose a payment method that will allow you to pay in part with Membership Rewards points. If your default payment method is not a Membership Rewards card, change your payment method before you input any promo codes (some have reported errors when inputting the code before using any points). After changing the payment method, you can choose how much you want to pay in points. You can choose as little as $0.01 (1 Membership Rewards point) to get the full discount. Then, enter code FIRE7TAB for the Fire 7 or code FIRE8TAB for the Fire 8 and your total should come down to $15 each for Fire 7’s or $25 each for Fire 8’s.\n\nIn my case, the total for five Fire 8 tablets comes to $124.95 before tax or $134.94 with tax.\n\nCan you stack it with a gift card?\n\nYou sure can. I don’t know if there is a certain amount that must be paid with your credit card, but I do know that you can apply a gift card. I just bought a $25 Amazon gift card in the MileagePlus X app to test this. I added it as a payment method (still choosing a Membership Rewards card and at least 1 point for payment).\n\nAs you can see, the $25 gift card also applied to my payment.\n\nCan it stack with a snack?\n\nYou betcha. Doctor of Credit posted a few weeks ago about a free snack for Prime members with an order of $25 or more. I was only able to use the code once, but I got a free munchie. See his post for how you can, too. I grabbed the Happy Belly Yogurt trail mix. I’ll let ya know if it makes me happy. It was $8.80 when I got it and it cost me nothing.\n\nCan it stack with vitamins?\n\nThat’s affirmative. If you are healthier than I am, you might rather choose to get some free vitamins worth up to about $25 instead of $8.80 trail mix. See this Doctor of Credit post for details on that.\n\nBut what are you going to do with 40 Fire tablets?\n\nThe short answer is this: I didn’t buy 40 of them. However, I certainly did buy more than 5. I’m sure that a couple will become gifts — definitely a more generous-looking gift than the $15-$25 we spent on them. Many of them will probably be resold — mostly locally, via Craigslist/LetGo/Facebook/etc. I figure it shouldn’t be too hard to double on these (selling for $30/$50) as the holidays approach. I haven’t even looked at eBay these past few days — I’m sure the resale market is saturated beyond imagination at the moment. However, these are cheap enough that I don’t mind floating the money for a couple of months. As we get closer to the holidays, there will surely be some people who are happy to save a few bucks and pay a few more than I did. It’s a win-win. At these prices, they certainly wouldn’t be a bad donation to a local school / charitable organization / local fundraiser / etc, so even if I can’t sell them all, I’ll at least donate the yellow ones a couple of them. I have no doubt that each tablet I’ve ordered will find a home somewhere.\n\nThanks to Jen J for posting this deal in the Frequent Miler Insiders group yesterday and a hat tip to Mark Ostermann for noting that the limit is for each color.\n\n \n\nEarn Miles Without Flying: START HERE\t\n\nThe post Can I interest you in 40 Amazon Fire tablets? appeared first on Frequent Miler.",

          "description": "Just a few days after 9/11, then-president George W. Bush delivered a compassionate address to America’s “Muslim brothers and sisters”: “These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith,” he said, “and it’s important for my fellow Americans to understand that.”\n\nIn 16 years, things have changed dramatically. America’s current president has demonized Islam, spreading false rumors about Muslims celebrating in response to 9/11, openly accusing Syrian refugees of being terrorists, and making one of his main policy priorities the curtailing of immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries.\n\nDonald Trump is in many a ways a symptom of a greater shift in American culture: Since 9/11, it has increasingly become acceptable to suspect Muslims of being a threat to the country without the normal proof or justification that would be required if that charge was levied against a member of any other religious or ethnic group. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 50% of US Muslims reported that in recent years their religion was making their lives more difficult, and nearly as many say they faced at least one episode of discrimination in 2016.\n\nAnd, as researchers at the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society found in a recent report, Islamophobia is also starting to get baked into the American legal system. The report, published Sep. 8, examines dozens of anti-Sharia laws that have been approved in recent years that, the researchers argue, have channeled Islamophobia and, in turn, exacerbated the problem.\n\n The researchers compiled a comprehensive dataset of every anti-Sharia law proposed in US state legislatures from 2010 to 2016, identifying 194 bills in 39 different states. \n\nCombing through state legislature websites, the researchers compiled a comprehensive dataset of every anti-Sharia law proposed in US state legislatures from 2010 to 2016, identifying 194 bills in 39 different states. So far, 18 of the 194 bills have been enacted into law in 12 states.\n\nOnly 14 of the 194 anti-Sharia laws identified actually included the word “Sharia.” The remaining 180 bills were included because researchers felt confident they could make a strong argument that the intent behind those pieces of legislation was anti-Sharia, often because they were promoted as such by their sponsor.\n\nFor example, they included as anti-Sharia any bill that was modeled after the The American Laws for American Courts Act, an act promoted by the anti-Sharia advocacy group The American Public Policy Alliance and written by anti-Sharia activist David Yerushalmi. The text of the Americans Laws for American Courts Act talks about “protecting” the US from “foreign laws” broadly, rather than explicitly from Sharia, yet on the web page that promotes the legislation, the dangers of Sharia are referred to repeatedly, while no other type of “foreign law,” religious or otherwise, is mentioned.\n\n  Of the 385 sponsors of anti-Sharia bills identified, 373 were Republicans. \n\nOf the 385 sponsors of anti-Sharia bills identified, 373 were Republicans, and of the twelve states to pass anti-Sharia bills, eight are in the Republican-leaning US South.\n\nThe researchers argue that anti-Sharia rhetoric and law-making isn’t, as it claims to be, an attempt to curb extremism, but rather a way to spread an Islamophobic attitude, by identifying Islam with violence and repression. “This represents a demonization of Islam that is a complete distortion of what it is, and is inventing a spectrum of damage that doesn’t actually exist,” says Tisa Wenger, a professor of American religious history at Yale University, who wasn’t involved in this study.\n\n “This represents a demonization of Islam that is a complete distortion of what it is, and is inventing a spectrum of damage that doesn’t actually exist.” \n\nThis, the researchers say, is a deliberate strategy to use anti-Muslim rhetoric to polarize the political climate in the hopes of creating a conservative consensus. Building up Islamophobia appears to have become a popular demagogic tactic in US politics: the majority of anti-Sharia laws passed in 2011, 2013, and 2015—each before presidential or midterm elections. “The push for anti-Sharia legislation by lawmakers in a year prior to midterm and presidential election cycles provides a mechanism to normalize, legalize, and proliferate Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment among the American public,” the report reads. As University of Detroit Mercy law professor Khaled Beydoun argued in his paper on political Islamophobia, these bills and laws prepared a fertile ground for Trump’s rise to power.\n\nThis isn’t the first time religion has been used as a tool to stir the emotions of the US electorate. From the founding of the US until the late 1950s, Catholics were portrayed as “a danger to American democracy,” says Wenger. Politicians stoked the public’s fear of Catholics by raising suspicion that their loyalty would lie with the pope rather than the US. Catholics, the political rhetoric of the time went, were a threat to American freedom, because they would try to implement religious repression on everyone.\n\nOver time, the anti-Catholic sentiment became conflated with resentment of Italian, Irish, and Polish immigrants and their descendents, most of whom were Catholic and who represented the bulk of the 30 million foreigners who entered the US in 1800s and early 1900s. In the late 1800s, discrimination against the Irish was so common that the label No Irish Need Apply (NINA) showed up regularly in classified ads and the lyrics to popular songs.\n\n In recent years, the states that have passed anti-Sharia bills also are among the states with the fewest Muslims. \n\nThen, as now, Wenger notes, the communities that were most resentful towards Catholics were the ones least exposed to them. “Where the presence [of the minority] is small, that fear and distortion [can] take root,” she says. In recent years, the states that have passed anti-Sharia bills also are among the states with the fewest Muslims. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that just under 1% of the entire US population was Muslim, and that only three states (New York, New Jersey, and Arkansas) had a Muslim population of greater than 2%. Not one of these states has enacted an anti-Sharia bill. In contrast, eight of the 25 states with a Muslim population of less than 1% enacted such a bill.\n\nThis doesn’t surprise Wenger, who says that “familiarity helps to diffuse fear and anxiety.” If you don’t ever interact with Muslims, you are more likely to believe stereotypical, distorted representations.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Americans hate waiting. That’s why the US has drive-through fast-food chains, drive-through pharmacies, and drive-through ATMs. Why bother moving your legs slightly if not leaving your car is an option?\n\nBut over the last decade or so, as internet shopping has become increasingly simple, many Americans have managed to staunch their impatience to get what they want for slightly less money. If Amazon can sell a pack of AA batteries for $3 cheaper than the grocery store—and you don’t need those batteries immediately—it’s worth waiting.\n\nBut sometimes you can’t wait two days for your Amazon package to show up.\n\nPaul McDonald, a 13-year veteran of Google who help launched the earliest iterations of Google Wallet, wants to change the way we buy the most necessary things. “Americans are used to getting things that they want,” he said. Today, he’s launched a new startup called Bodega, that he hopes will fill a void left by shopping on the web.\n\nBodega, unlike the name suggests, is not a small deli at the end of your street that sells sandwiches, has a cat, and maybe some decent beer. The company produces squat internet-connected, wood-and-glass cabinets meant to reside in the common spaces we all use every day, like the gym or the office. The cabinets are filled with items to buy that are relevant to where you are at that given moment: In the office, they might be filled with snacks and drinks; at the gym, they could have Gatorade, supplements, and knee braces; in an apartment lobby, there could be detergent, pharmaceutical goods, and perhaps some snacks, too. Whatever makes most sense.\n\nWhat you need, where you need it. (Bodega)\n\nHere’s how it works: Users with the Bodega app find a cabinet near them, type its unique identifying number into the app, and then it opens. They take out the items they want—10 cameras with custom-trained computer vision keeps track of what they’re doing—and close the cabinet. Much like a miniature version of how Amazon intends to run its grocery stories, the customer’s card is automatically charged for whatever they take out, and they’re free to go back to their apartment with that box of Lucky Charms they were in dire need of. McDonald said the company keeps humans in the loop to review footage captured from the cameras in case their computer vision model recognizes something incorrectly. Customers can comment through the app if there’s a been a mix-up.\n\nMcDonald told Quartz that the company buys the items it stocks its cabinet with at wholesale prices, and will sell them at retail prices. Building owners can install the Bodegas at no cost—McDonald said the cost of building the cabinets is covered by the markup on the items it sells—and they pay for the goods inside. Bodega will offer a range of items to sell, building owners can choose what to stock, and customers can suggest items through the app.\n\nBodega’s model is intended to compete against the Amazon approach of selling you anything you want and getting it eventually.\n\nThis, of course, is a tall order.\n\n“We’re shrinking the store and putting it in a box,” McDonald said, suggesting his cabinets could be a way for traditional retailers to fight Amazon’s creep into their business. Perhaps a GNC-branded Bodega could be put in a gym, or a Walgreens-branded box installed in an apartment lobby.\n\nEven when Amazon achieves its dream of being able to ship small goods to customers around the world with drones, physical and logistical limitations will mean it’s highly unlikely that Amazon will be able to deliver things to people quicker than about 30 minutes. And sometimes, you just need things fast: Imagine it’s 11pm, you’re getting ready to go to sleep, and realize you’re out of toothpaste. You won’t want to wait 30 minutes for an Amazon drone to show up, or get dressed to go to the pharmacy.\n\nMcDonald said that there are now roughly 30 cabinets in use around the Bay Area, including some at fraternities and sororities at the University of California, Berkeley. That’s a space, that other than perhaps an old vending machine or two, that has never really been open to retailers. McDonald said the US has roughly 4 million vending machines and 5,000-odd 7-Eleven stores across the world—he wants Bodega to replace them all.\n\nWhether that’s possible—and what this would mean for thousands of retail employees working at convenience stores—is unclear. But Bodega isn’t alone in this quest: clothing retailer Uniqlo has been testing vending machines at airports for items you forgot to pack, and Best Buy has had similar machines for electronics for years.\n\nAt a time when Amazon is getting an increasingly large slice of the retail dollars spent on the internet, micro-shops containing the goods people need when they need them, cloud be a way for retailers to combat the online giant. It might well be a better option that selling the same commoditized items Amazon does and hoping people will choose your website over Amazon’s. Or perhaps the future will just be stores devoid of any merchandise whatsoever.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "United’s MileagePlus program has undergone quite a transformation in the past few years. Award chart devaluations, the shift to revenue-based earnings and award routing rule changes have made the current MileagePlus stand in stark contrast to the program circa 2014. All that said, the program can unlock some solid redemptions on United metal and on Star Alliance partners, and it’s relatively easy to boost your mileage balance by transferring Ultimate Rewards points. Today, I’ll cover the top five things you need to know about United MileagePlus.\n\n1. XN Fare Availability Makes a Difference\n\nWe all want to pay the lower, Saver-level prices for award tickets on United-operated flights, which requires finding “X” fare Saver availability. As an added perk for Chase United co-branded card holders — for cards such as the United MileagePlus Explorer Card — United has a separate fare class of Saver award space, XN, that cardholders can view and book when logged in to their United account. It’s not uncommon to see results like the below screenshot; on a search for Washington, DC (IAD) to Charleston, SC (CHS) I have two extra flights at the Saver level available to me because I’m a cardholder:\n\nI’ll happily pay the $95 annual fee for the MileagePlus Explorer Card to get the XN space — it makes that much of a difference.\n\n2. United’s Award Search Engine Has Some Kinks\n\nWhen using the United award search engine, it’s important that you don’t take the initial results — or the calendar view results — at face value. By changing inputs such as cabin desired, departure time and displaying only nonstop routes, and by searching one-way, you can alter the routing options and seats that United.com shows.\n\nThis becomes even more important if you want a specific routing not initially shown on United.com. United no longer allows you to search for any two flights that show Saver availability and then call an agent to piece together your itinerary. If you want to book a itinerary that has Saver seats but it’s not an option shown on United.com, you’ll have to pay for each individual flight you want to book.\n\nSimilarly, for Star Alliance partner itineraries, United.com won’t display all (or any) of the possibilities on your first search. It’s important that you know your most desired routing and the flights possible so you can work the engine to give it the routing you want.\n\nA quick example: Next April I’m going to New Zealand and have been looking at return options. A quick one-way search for Auckland to Atlanta (AKL-ATL) on April 25, even with the flexible date box checked, still shows no results available:\n\nHowever, when I change the initial search from AKL-ATL to Auckland-San Francisco, limiting the itinerary to only one connection, a search result appears:\n\nOn the above screen, I change the destination from San Francisco to Atlanta, click search again and voilà:\n\nMultiple options now appear for Auckland to Atlanta at the Saver level on April 25. So get to know the nuances of the United award search engine, and be prepared to do multiple searches to get it to cooperate.\n\n3. Take Advantage of the Excursionist Perk\n\nUnited did away with its great award routing rules that allowed multiple stopovers and open jaws and replaced it with the Excursionist Perk, selling it as a “more flexible and intuitive” award-booking option. The simplest way to explain the Excursionist Perk is that on a round-trip award itinerary, the first flight you add that’s not in the same zone as the originating region won’t cost you extra miles. The free flight must be within a single zone, booked in the same or lower class as the inbound and outbound legs, and the round-trip ticket must end in the same zone it originated from.\n\nGiven the loose set of rules United has laid out for the Excursionist Perk, there are actually a lot of neat things you can do to maximize it. Here’s an option to get you inspired:\n\nTokyo Narita (NRT) – Washington Dulles (IAD) / Singapore (SIN) – Bangkok (BKK) – Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) / Osaka (KIX) – Tokyo Haneda (HND)\nCost: 40,000 miles\n\nThe itinerary prices as follows:\n\nNRT-IAD: 35,000 miles\nSIN-BKK-SGN:0 miles\nKIX-HND: 5,000 miles\n\nThe itinerary qualifies for the Excursionist because travel begins and ends in the same zone (Japan), and the first leg added is not in the origination zone and is wholly within a single zone (Southeast Asia). The KIX-HND leg is added for the itinerary to end in Japan, meaning I can get the SIN-BKK leg for free.\n\nYou can complete a second, similar Excursionist itinerary to close the loops and give yourself one heck of a vacation to multiple Asian destinations for very few miles.\n\n4. Pay Attention to Your Flight’s Equipment Type\n\nThe carrier has labeled most international business-class flights as Polaris on United.com. I’m hearing weekly now from people who are confused when they board and discover that it is the same old hard product with only the new Polaris soft product (think bedding and dinner presentation).\n\nTPG enjoying the new Polaris cabin on the 777-300ER.\nYou’re flying the new Polaris product in its entirety only if you’re flying the new 777-300ER, which is only serving a few routes (or if you’re lucky enough to snag a seat on the single 767-300ER that has been retrofitted). Check the route on United.com to look for 777-300ER, and check the seatmap if you’re flying on a 767:\n\nNext, there’s such a variety of equipment in the United fleet that you want to make sure you choose the best product available for your route. Look at a simple domestic route like Washington Dulles – Houston. On any given day you can pay the same 25,000 miles for a business-class seat but be on either a regional Embraer ERJ-175, narrow-body recliner 737 or 757, or a wide-body 767 with lie-flat seats — obviously, there’s a huge difference in onboard experience. The flights often leave an hour apart from each other, so make sure you look at the details of your flight and don’t sit on a regional when you could enjoy a 767.\n\n5. Booking Last-Minute Award Tickets Is Expensive, But Availability Is Great\n\nWhen booking a MileagePlus award ticket within 21 days of departure, you’ll have to pay a steep fee of $75 per ticket. Close-in ticketing fees remain one of the silliest ancillary airline charges, so make sure you know what you’re getting into if you want to use your miles close to departure. If you have United elite status, your fee will either be waived or reduced: Silver members pay $50, Gold pay $25 and Platinum and 1K members have the fee waived entirely.\n\nEven with close-in ticketing fees, I still look to United to book tickets close to departure because the program has the best award availability out of the legacy carriers. As a United cardholder, I estimate there’s a 75% chance I’ll find a last-minute Saver seat to my destination, excluding holidays. If I need a last-minute ticket that would cost $500+ but is available for 10,000 – 12,500 miles and $80.60, I’ll happily take the deal.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEven with the routing and pricing changes, this program has plenty to offer. It’s worth putting in the effort to learn the nuances to using the United.com award search engine and to understand and maximize all the possibilities of the Excursionist Perk. Above-average last-minute award availability is the icing on the cake with United MileagePlus.\n\nWhat are your top tips for maximizing the MileagePlus program?\n",

          "description": "Sep. 12, 2017 at 9:53 AM\n\nPoliticians Write Lots Of Books. Here’s How Far Into Them People Read.\n\nHillary Clinton’s new book, “What Happened,” comes out Tuesday and features her reflections on the 2016 election. Whether it’ll enter the pantheon of great campaign memoirs or turn out to be just another post-politics potboiler, “What Happened” is by all appearances the first hot political book of the fall.\n\nIt also apparently offers some compelling content, including relitigating internecine fights in the Democratic Party, openly assailing the character of a sitting president and recounting the inside story of one of the most stunning campaign failures in U.S. history. And that, by itself, might distinguish it from the political memoir genre in general. Political books written around a presidential election are usually a mixture of ghostwritten policy proposals slammed together with a series of mediocre pseudo-biographical stories that often backfire on a contender mid-race.These paperweights are defined by long subtitles and the struggle of making a politician a likable protagonist.\n\nBut people still read them. Well, sort of. I was curious how far readers typically make it through these books. I couldn’t get any reading data, but I reached out to Audiobooks.com for listening data on political memoirs by presidential candidates going back to the 2000 election. We focused on books by every “serious” candidate published before or shortly after each presidential election — “serious” as defined by my colleague Harry Enten back before the 2016 election. (Basically, any candidate who held a major political office before running or got at least a bit of the vote in Iowa or New Hampshire.) Audiobooks.com was able to find the books with more than 10 downloads and sent over the average percentage of the book that listeners sat through.\n\nBefore we get to the data, there are some caveats! If you don’t see a book on here, remember that not all books have an audio version widely available. Moreover, sales for some of these books peaked long before Audiobooks.com began collecting data. Second, if a completion rate number seems low, keep in mind that most people don’t finish reading most things. Most likely, less than half of the people who started this article made it to this sentence. It’s the nature of the game.\n\nWhich political books did listeners stick with?\n\nBy presidential candidates on Audiobooks.com since the 2000 election\n\nAVERAGE\n\nPUB.▲▼\n\nAUTHOR▲▼\n\nTITLE▲▼\n\nLENGTH (HRS)▲▼\n\nSHARE OF BOOK READ▲▼\n\nTIME SPENT LISTENING (HRS)▲▼\n\n2010\n\nGeorge W.

The average reader made it through three-quarters of “Faith of My Fathers” by John McCain. That’s ridiculously high. Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Mike Huckabee all had average completion percentages, between 65 and 70 percent, for “American Dreams,” “Unintimidated,” and “God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,” respectively. The books that don’t do so well by this measure come from both sides of the aisle, but they do have one thing in common: They’re looooong.\n\nSo the other way to gauge who’s written the most engaging political books is to look at how much time listeners are spending with them. (The right-most column.) We can use the average amount of time spent listening to a book — completion percentage multiplied by book length — which doesn’t penalize books for being lengthier. In this case, “Decision Points,” the presidential memoir by President George W. Bush, “Hard Choices,” the 2014 memoir by Hillary Clinton, and “A Time for Truth” by Ted Cruz come out looking very good. It turns out that people are willing to listen to Bush, Clinton and Cruz speak uninterrupted for many more hours than I expected. Seriously, the fact that George W. Bush is not only an accomplished author but perhaps the most successful author in his field (at least by one metric) is not a notion I would have even entertained before I started digging into this. Well done, Dubs.\n\nWhat about the books that listeners barely made a dent in? Second from the bottom is “Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America” by President Trump, and in last place is “It Takes a Village,” a slimmed-down version of a 1996 Hillary Clinton volume that was later turned into a picture book.\n",

          "description": "Intriguing lottery picks who are as young, explosive, and offensively compelling as Zach LaVine rarely switch teams before their second contract. But after he tore his ACL in February, the 22-year-old was traded a few months ago from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Chicago Bulls. He now finds himself as the closest thing one of the NBA's marquee organizations has to a marketable star.\n\nHere's what we know: The trade that advanced LaVine from a gunslinging third option on one of the league's most exciting teams to the primary threat inside a dumpster fire will inevitably proliferate his responsibilities. What we don't yet know is whether it'll work out. Can he improve and evolve while taking on a larger role, and even eventually help make the Bulls a respectable outfit once again? Or are his current flaws too glaring to ever overcome?\n\nLaVine's former team was seemingly on track to become the blue-chip-studded stepchild of the Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook-led Oklahoma City Thunder—with Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins projected to grow into what those two All-NBA studs became. As the interdependent variable whose production could either push that duo forward or hold it back, LaVine was the question mark. Now that he's gone, how does his outlook compare to two other third-wheel guards who charted their own path outside Durant and Westbrook's shadow: James Harden (for better) and Reggie Jackson (for worse).\n\nLast season, the sport's most electrifying cloud hopper assumed a part that was molded to his ability. Instead of setting the table, as he was asked to do when he entered the league, LaVine ate everything that was placed in front of him. According to Basketball-Reference, his minutes spent as a point guard completely evaporated—from 94 percent as a rookie, to zero—while his assist and turnover rates cut in half. Even though his overall field goal attempts didn't spike, LaVine migrated behind the three-point line and saw his minutes climb up to 37.2 per game as he became a full-time starter in the first year of Tom Thibodeau's regime.\n\nHe was and still is the rustiest link in any defensive scheme, but LaVine couldn't be ignored whenever Minnesota had the ball. He flew off screens, pulled up off hand offs, and dazzled in spurts with individual shot creation that wasn't forced.\n\nLife won't be so simple in Chicago. The aforementioned ACL injury—which occurred when LaVine came off a stagger screen, caught a pass skidding towards the rim, then landed awkwardly after a mid-air collision with Andre Drummond—will obviously steepen the incline of LaVine's development, and after he returns there will be no capitalizing off Ricky Rubio's brilliant vision, let alone the widening vacuum of attention that Towns and Wiggins demand.\n\nLaVine struggled, relatively, when any of those three didn't share the court with him last season. He was thrust into a familiar yet uncomfortable spot and struggled to balance his needs with decisions that would untangle complications for his teammates. For LaVine to enter another realm and justify any worthwhile comparisons to the most diversified players at his position, he must expand his repertoire enough to impact games when he, himself, isn't putting the ball through the net.\n\nThis is why any comparison, beyond their early-career situation, to Harden is unfair. The annual MVP candidate's True Shooting percentage was an ungodly 66.0 as Oklahoma City's Sixth Man in his third season (LaVine's was 57.6). A gifted passer who proved he could hold his own on a meaningful stage, Harden kept his True Shooting percentage above 60.0 in 20 playoff games while averaging 18 points, six rebounds, and five assists per 36 minutes.\n\nHarden lived at the free-throw line and created open shots for others. He possesses a natural crafty strength few before him have been able to harness. Signs of stardom were clear. LaVine is not that special. He's slippery, and single-handedly marks an asterisk beside the rules of gravity, but was one of eight players in the last 10 years to average at least 18 points with a free-throw rate below .200 last season.\n\nLaVine only averaged 4.3 drives per game last year—the same amount as Philadelphia 76ers backup point guard Sergio Rodriguez, who averaged 15 fewer minutes. Yikes. What the former 13th overall pick can do, though, is really shoot—a vital characteristic that should never be overlooked. According to Synergy Sports, he finished in the 87th percentile in spot-up situations last season. Of catch-and-shoot threes and threes launched when wide open, he knocked down 43.2 percent, an elite number that matches up nicely with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\nIf he can bump his accuracy off the dribble up and force defenders to take away those tough looks, there's a decent chance LaVine can evolve into the most valuable type of weapon NBA basketball currently knows. A modest leap of faith is required when counting on anyone not named Curry to get there at a high volume, but LaVine has the quick release and springy legs to do it. Levitating above perimeter defenders isn't an issue for him, and it's realistic to believe he can someday drill pull-up threes at a 40 percent clip.\n\nDoing so would widen driving lanes and allow him to become more of a threat at the rim, where he's actually not a bad finisher. LaVine is already terrific in the open floor, but he'll be diabolical if he can force help defenders to pinch in off the arc in half-court situations.\n\nThere are no guarantees LaVine will reach that level, though, and—assuming Dwyane Wade spends a majority of this season on a different team—his usage rate will soar in lineups that rely upon him to do most of the heavy lifting. It's more likely than not LaVine struggles badly in his first year as a go-to choice. Lauri Markkanen and (the still unsigned) Nikola Mirotic will create space as best they can, while Cristiano Felicio and Robin Lopez will roam as rim-rolling cinder blocks. But none of that's very inspiring.\n\nElsewhere, it's (even more) bleak. Kris Dunn and Denzel Valentine don't warrant significant minutes in an NBA game, and Paul Zipser might be the Bulls' third option whenever he's on the court.\n\nLaVine is currently eligible for a contract extension, but Chicago would be wise to sit negotiations out until he proves he's A) healthy and B) expanding his strengths. It would've been interesting to see LaVine's career play out underneath Towns and Wiggins, perhaps evolving into a necessary, and highly entertaining, spark off the bench.\n\nNow he's forced to provide more substance with a skill-set that's yet to indicate it can. LaVine has room to breathe and space to grow, but that probably isn't his calling.",

          "description": "Jaguar, having freshly committed to electrifying all of its cars from 2020 onwards, has today also unveiled a new all-electric automobile, which is based on its sleek E-type from the 1960s. The new E-type Zero keeps the classic styling, which was once lauded as “the most beautiful car in the world” by Enzo Ferrari, while introducing a bespoke electric powertrain that produces up to 220kW of power. It will take you from 0 to 100kmh in 5.5 seconds, which isn’t quite Tesla territory in terms of acceleration, but let’s be honest, no Tesla has ever looked quite this dashingly gorgeous.\n\nMore than a concept, but not much more\n\nThe E-type Zero roadster is said to have a real-world range of 270km (just under 170 miles) thanks to a 40kWh battery that can be fully recharged in six to seven hours. As it stands, this is simply a retrofit of an electric car into the shell of an old school classic, and Jaguar isn’t being terribly explicit about either pricing or availability. It seems to be more than a concept, but not much more than that. Tim Hannig, chief of Jaguar Land Rover Classic, says that the company’s “aim with the E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership. We’re looking forward to the reaction of our clients as we investigate bringing this concept to market.”\n\nThe basic premise of bringing classic car designs up to date with electrification and other modern niceties like LED headlights, as with this E-type Zero, seems like an ingenious way of appealing to a younger clientele — which has both an appreciation for the past and an eagerness to embrace the future. Jaguar is showing off the E-Type Zero at the Jaguar Land Rover Tech Fest event in London, which is open to the public between September 8th and 10th.\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n Jaguar E-type Zero Photo: Jaguar Land Rover\n",

          "description": "Household Participation in Stock Market Varies Widely by State\nYiLi Chien , Paul MorrisThe Regional Economist, Third Quarter 2017\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom 1928 to 2016, the average annual stock return was about 8 percentage points higher than the return on three-month Treasury bills. This leads to sizable return gaps over time: $100 investments in stocks and in Treasury bills in 1928 would have yielded nearly $329,000 and $2,000, respectively, 88 years later.1\n\nGiven the high return of stocks, it is puzzling that many households do not participate in the stock market and, hence, forgo the high return. In addition, the nonparticipation behavior is at odds with modern portfolio theory. The theory implies that all households should invest at least a fraction of their wealth in stocks in order to take advantage of the equity premium. However, the data show that many households do not participate in financial markets.\n\nThe inability of modern portfolio theory to explain what is observed in the data leads to a “participation puzzle.” A common explanation of this puzzle is the individual participation cost, which includes both monetary and nonmonetary costs. The monetary costs are relatively straightforward, including transaction or brokerage fees. The nonmonetary costs are broadly defined to be the cognitive and time costs of understanding the investment object or processing previous experiences with stock markets. The participation cost, especially the nonmonetary costs, could vary widely across the population.\n\nWhile this participation puzzle has been well-documented at the national level, this article takes a first step in exploring whether the rates vary geographically. The aim is to see if the participation rate at the national level occurred homogeneously across states or if people in some states participated at a higher rate than others.\n\nIf the data indicate that there are regional differences in these rates, academic researchers could explore these disparities to better understand and resolve the puzzle. In addition, a better understanding of households’ investment decisions across regions could improve the quality and effectiveness of conducting government policy.\n\nTo answer this question, we employed the IRS’ individual income and tax data for 2014, the most recent year available. The data contain information on income from taxable dividends. We approximated the stock market participation rate as the ratio of the number of tax returns with dividend income to the number of total tax returns filed.\n\nWe used tax return data because of its availability at the state level. However, there is a shortcoming in doing so. Given that not all companies pay dividends out of their profits each year and that the dividend incomes of retirement accounts are not taxable, our figure underestimates the true participation rate and should therefore be considered a lower bound. Fortunately, this shortcoming might be less of a concern when comparing participation rates across states, as the downward bias is likely to affect states uniformly.\n\nWide Disparities among States\n\nThe data show a large variation in stock market participation rates across the United States. The disparities are sizable, with rates ranging from 10.5 percent in Mississippi to 26.6 percent in Connecticut. This seems reasonable, as the average household income is higher in Connecticut than in Mississippi and the existing literature shows that the participation rate increases with income.2\n\nHowever, this is not the whole story. Even when controlling for household income level, the large variation in participation across states prevails. Figure 1 plots the participation rates for Connecticut, Mississippi and the United States across different income groups. The participation gap remains large for each group, indicating that household income level does not entirely lead to differences in participation rates.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nNote that this holds even for those groups with high income. In the income group ranging from $100,000 up to but not including $200,000, the participation gap stands at 14.2 percentage points (31.5 percent in Mississippi versus 45.7 percent in Connecticut).\n\nThis finding is even more puzzling when the cost of living is taken into consideration. The cost of living is lower in Mississippi, so given the same income level, those with high incomes in Mississippi should have more funds to invest in the stock market than comparable households in Connecticut.3\n\nThis pattern is not specific to these two states. Figure 2 maps the stock market participation rates across states for those with a relatively high household income: $100,000 up to but not including $200,000. Darker shades of blue indicate higher participation rates. Participation ranges from 30.7 percent in Utah to 47.5 percent in Vermont. This finding suggests that there might be some regional factors that are affecting the stock market participation rates.\n\nWhat might these factors be? It is difficult to argue that individual participation costs are able to explain such large differences in participation rates from state to state. In today’s information age, the monetary costs of participating should be uniform across the country. There are many online brokers offering low-cost and convenient services for stock market transactions. Moreover, the differences in nonmonetary costs should be similar across states after controlling for income.\n\nFor example, given the same level of income, it is unlikely that the cognitive cost of processing investment knowledge could vary enough to explain the variation in participation across states.\n\nExploring the true regional factors is beyond the scope of this article. However, a potential explanation is the awareness of financial planning, which could be influenced heavily by the surrounding community. If households have less exposure to the importance of financial planning, then they are less likely to spend time and effort on improving investment decisions regardless of participation costs.\n\nThe investment decision matters for the welfare of households. Good financial decision-making could help households hedge against their income risks and achieve a better life. Although it is not necessarily the case that stock market participants are more financially sophisticated than nonparticipants, understanding the participation decisions made by households is important to both academic researchers and policymakers. An example is the shortage of retirement savings in the United States. If households cannot make the right investment decisions and, thereby, jeopardize their return on savings, then households are not only likely to save less but could fail to accumulate enough assets for retirement.\n\nYiLi Chien is an economist, and Paul Morris is a senior research associate, both at the Federal Reserve Bank at St. Louis.

          "description": "Finding a great note-taking app is like finding the perfect pair of jeans. They’re hard to come across, but once you do, you’ll always stick with them. The same goes for the best smartphone apps. Some people might still prefer the old, foolproof method of taking notes with pen and paper, but this is the mobile era, and having one good note-taking app on your phone can save you constant hassle. And for students heading back to college, the right notes app can keep you organized and on track.\n\nThat is why Evernote is by far my favorite note-taking app that helps me keep my life in order. I’ve been using the free version since early 2013. One of the best things about Evernote is that it works pretty much everywhere, including iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and on the web. If you want to get a little bit more from Evernote, such as more devices to sync across, offline access, or more robust storage features, you can sign up for the Plus Plan that starts at $25 annually. I personally feel like the free version will do just fine, as I’ve found 60MB of space to be pretty adequate for notes. But Evernote’s changing prices are one reason The Verge’s Casey Newton gave up on the app completely. Nonetheless, the free tier of Evernote still gets the job done. I’m going to be running through how to use Evernote on a Mac desktop, since that is mainly where I access it. But the app is pretty intuitive and fairly easy to understand on mobile, too. If you’re headed back to school, let’s focus on how to get the most out of this app so you can keep your GPA high throughout the year.\n\nNotebooks\n\nThe first thing to know is that Evernote allows you to organize notes by different “notebooks,” and “notes” within those notebooks. You can simply click the “new notebook” button on the top left corner of the app. Then, you can choose to either make it a private note or one that can be shared with collaborators or classmates. So, say you’re taking four very different classes this semester. You can create a notebook for each of these classes — each with their own notes — and you won’t have to jumble notes for all of them into one place. Instead of carrying around several physical Moleskins, you can have it all in one neat, virtual place. That’s got to be better for both you and the environment.\n\nChecklists\n\nThe neat thing about notes is that you can also decide how you want to view them. I personally prefer the card view, because it gives you a little snippet of your most recent notes on the left and a view of the entire note you’ve selected to the right. But definitely try them in the other views to see which layout suits you best. Once you create a note, there are numerous ways to organize your information. You can add web page clippings, images, and audio recordings all within one note. But perhaps my favorite feature is the check-box bullet point option. It’s great for to-do lists, and is a satisfying virtual equivalent of crossing off things from a handwritten list. You can get super granular and nerdy with it, too, by customizing sections with different colors, fonts, and separate sections with a horizontal line. Get your organizational nerd on!\n\nVoice Notes\n\nIf you’re about to kick off a boring 8AM lecture and you had a late night, Evernote’s voice notes feature might prove very useful. When you don’t feel like typing out your notes, simply hit the microphone button on the far right and select record. Just sit up close to the professor. On Mac, you can choose to have voice recordings saved right to your iTunes library, and they’re equally easy to share on other platforms. You can always go back to the recording later and take your own notes when you’re more attentive. Voice notes can definitely be a lifesaver.\n\nAttachments\n\nThere are two ways to attach files to a note: directly from your computer or from the cloud with Google Drive. For files on your computer, Evernote makes it easy with a simple drag-and-drop function. If you’re a visual learner, it’s easy to drop-in diagrams, videos, photos, GIFs, and anything else that is important in order to give yourself the full picture. For my “post LG Instagram” item on my checklist, I simply dropped the image into the note so I knew exactly which photo I’d be using. There’s also the paperclip icon on the top right corner of the note where you can add attachments that might not be on your desktop. The Google Drive attachment function is great because you can reference a spreadsheet or presentation that can’t be fully created in the free version of Evernote. In my case, I had a very lengthy spreadsheet within Google Docs that was housing all of my hotel, flight, and excursion confirmations for an upcoming trip to Spain. I dropped the attachment into my “Spain” note, and referenced it anytime I needed to add another to-do item.\n\nAdding web clippings\n\nSay you’re doing research for a paper and you want to save articles or web clippings, but don’t want to accumulate a list of URLs with no sense of which article holds what information. There are two ways to save web clippings so that you can have the entire article within a note. The way to do it on desktop is to first add the Evernote Web Clipper Chrome or Safari extension. Once you hit the little elephant icon, you can select which format you want to save the web clipping in. I prefer the “simplified article” option since it removes all the ads and other junk from the site. You can also add a remark, or title for the clip, and select which notebook to add it to. The process is similar for adding from your smartphone. When you’re reading an article, you hit the “share” button, and select the Evernote app from there. You just have to make sure that the Evernote toggle is turned on under “Activities.” The same menu will appear to allow you to add a note.\n\nCreating tables\n\nWhile you can create tables within Evernote, the catch is that they don’t work like your traditional excel spreadsheet. You can’t do simple calculations or really have any advanced formatting. However, tables are at least somewhat customizable by color, size, and border.\n\nSharing\n\nThere are a few ways you can share notes and notebooks. It’s similar to Google Drive in that you can manage permissions by allowing others to either view, edit, or both, and also add in a note for your share. This is great for passing along notes to classmates without copying and pasting into an email and losing the formatting. The other option is to share a note to either LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. I’m not entirely sure why you’d need to do that, but it’s there just in case.\n\nSetting Reminders\n\nReminders are particularly useful if you’ve been procrastinating on a project and need a gentle nudge to get it done. You can title a note the name of your project, and hit the alarm clock icon on the top right corner. Once you do that, Evernote allows you to add a date and time. All of your reminders will also show up in a neat list form above your notes preview if you’re in the card view. This works like a checklist, so once you’ve marked a reminder as complete, Evernote will cross it off like an item on your to-do list.\n\nSyncing\n\nWith the free tier of Evernote, you can sync up to two devices to access your notes. For a college student, this is perfect since it covers both your phone and laptop. If you’re on the subway and remember something last minute, you can open the app on your phone and make a note, but you need to make sure it’s synced so that you see that note on your laptop the next time you open it. How do you know if your work has been synced? If you click on the “i” button on the top right corner, you can edit the metadata of your note and see the last time it was synced. If you just updated a note and need to sync it, click on the two circular arrows button at the top left side of the app. Now you can be sure to find any updates to a note on both of the devices.\n\nRecovering deleted notes\n\nOne time, I accidentally deleted one of the most important notes I had for an upcoming presentation and was horrified that I’d lost it forever. But not to worry, that’s what the “trash” icon on the left-hand side is for. Once you click on a deleted note in this folder, it gives you the option to either delete it forever or recover it. Accidental deletions won’t be a catastrophe. So check in there from time to time if something goes missing.\n\nPresenting\n\nFinally, if you put together a big presentation or plan inside of a note, you can actually present it by entering presentation mode. You access this by hitting the play button icon on the top right next to the alarm clock icon. Presentation mode makes everything look really clean, and there are a few options for how it’s displayed: you can choose between having the note divided into slides with horizontal lines, removing screen breaks, or go with an auto layout.\n\nIt feels like there are endless ways to use Evernote, from making it your simple, everyday notes app to learning some of its more sophisticated features. Use it for school, work, life, and beyond. But hopefully you’ll now go in with a better understanding of how to best make the app feel less overwhelming, and instead make it work for you.\n",

          "description": "Last month, furniture company Joybird decided to determine the most popular interior design trends across America. The company’s methodology involved compiling a list of 15 different design trends, from bohemian to coastal to shabby chic, and then combing through Google Trends data to assess each category's search popularity over the course of the past year.\n\nPhoto by Joybird\n\nThe company’s findings? In terms of popularity, bohemian won out as the most searched overall in the country. It commanded eight states, from Alaska to New Jersey, scattered across regions. Victorian wasn’t too far behind, the most popular in seven states. Traditional decor is hot in Hawaii; Idaho’s fallen for shabby chic. The lone state to pine for coastal design was South Carolina, while modern farmhouse was only popular in Utah.\n\nOf course, Joybird is working off the assumption that search frequency corresponds to actual popularity, so take these findings with a dose of skepticism. Browse the full list below. What most compels me: Rustic wasn’t the most popular design search term in any state, nor was “casual modern,” a category that didn’t even merit a place on the key of the company’s visualization!

          "description": "A new leaked warranty guide for Apple iPhones shows how the company determines which iPhones are eligible for repair under warranty. Conditions are outlined for in-warranty repair, out-of-warranty repair, and devices categorized as “ineligible” due to damage or unauthorized modification. The 22-page guide is dated March 3, 2017 and was leaked recently to Dropbox, reports Business Insider. Called the “Visual/Mechanical Inspection Guide” (VMI) the document covers the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, and 7 Plus.\n\nThe types of damage that Apple covers under its warranty service includes debris under display glass or pixel anomaly, a misalignment of the FaceTime camera foam, or a single hairline crack to the front glass without an impact point. The VMI notes that devices with these types of impairments are covered regardless of any accidental or liquid damage.\n\n Image: Business Insider\n\nOther damage, including LCD fractures, damage due to laser contact with the camera, extreme abrasion or puncture holes, multiple cracks in the glass, and damaged connectors are eligible for out-of-warranty service. Apple however, deems an iPhone ineligible for service if it shows intentional tampering or damage, is a disassembled unit or missing parts, contains non-Apple batteries, or is damaged “catastrophically.” Apple does note however, that AppleCare+ customers may be covered for catastrophic damage. AppleCare+’s hardware coverage does cover up to two incidents of accidental damage — with a fee of $29 for screen damage, or $99 for any other damage.\n\nThere is also a section on water damage and what to do if Apple’s liquid contact indicator (LCI) is triggered. Technicians are advised to pull apart the phone and check the indicator (which turns red when exposed to water) if a user disputes water damage. The document also shows that Apple doesn’t cover cosmetic damage to phones like chipping, dents, scratches, and scuff marks.\n\n Image: Business Insider  Image: Business Insider\n\nOne Apple technician told Business Insider there was a similar warranty document for all of the company’s products, which are “used more for the physical inspection and how to determine cost for damage.” Another technician (also known as Geniuses) noted that the VMIs aren’t often used unless there’s an “oddball issue.”\n\n\"There are always those one-off issues that the phone is technically not covered under warranty but we swap the phone anyways under warranty,\" another Genius worker said.\n",

          "description": "Here at TPG we spotlight stories from our readers — fantastic travel made possible with some savvy tips and tricks. In our new lounge on Facebook, TPG Lounge member Serenity Forbes shared some insights on navigating Disneyland in California. Do you have tips to share? If your story catches TPG’s eye and we publish it, we’ll send you a gift to jump-start your next adventure!\n\n \n\nGENERAL ADVICE\nGet there early — as close to opening time as possible. It sucks, but when you walk into Tomorrowland and no one is there, it’s pretty amazing. Some parts of the park are empty for the first few hours — mainly Critter Country and Small World; Toon Town is also empty when it opens, usually an hour after the park opens.\n\nThe Disneyland app is shockingly accurate and helpful, but I also use an app called Mousewait that gives better info for stuff like parade times and when rides will be shut down for maintenance and for how long.\n\nPARKING \nToy Story continues to be our preferred parking lot and shuttle to the park. There is less hassle than the parking structure/tram and the parking folks there are much friendlier. On a good day, the buses are lined up in a single line (instead of the amorphous blob of the Disneyland tram). No one really cuts in line and it’s a much more fair system.\n\nFOOD\nThere are no restrictions for bringing in food, though they don’t allow glass containers or alcohol. We always pack a lunchbox full of sandwiches, fruit and hearty snacks to keep us full throughout the day. It saves so much money; you can also bring in empty water bottles and fill them up at drinking fountains all day.\n\nThere is a Starbucks on Main Street and while they don’t have a sign out front, if you go in (on the right side, halfway-down towards castle) they have a full Starbucks menu.\n\nIf you know you will be at the park on a certain day, you should make a dining reservation for somewhere like Blue Bayou. Dining reservations can be made six weeks in advance online and you can cancel up to one day before your reservation without being charged. (If you do eat at the Blue Bayou, request a table by the water.)\n\nRIDES/ACTIVITIES/SHOWS\nMap out what rides you want to hit; if they’re popular ones, you need to grab those fastpasses first and/or ride them first. On a typical Sunday morning at 8:15am, you can walk onto Space Mountain or wait a few minutes. Within an hour, the line is at least 45 minutes-long.\n\nIf you have small children, or kids who simply don’t want to ride a big kid ride, you can ask for a parent swap pass: It enables one parent to watch the small/unwilling children while the other rides. These swap passes are good all day; we like to save them for the afternoon when the ride lines are the longest. For almost every ride, you use a swap like a fastpass and parent swaps are available on any ride where there is a height requirement.\n\nCHARACTERS\nWe always do Pixie Hollow first thing in the morning as the lines tend to be very long in the middle of the day, but at 9:00am on a Sunday, you maybe have to wait 5-10 minutes.\n\nThere are a handful of cast member entrances/exits to the park. One is by the bathrooms, nearby the rocket ships in Tomorrowland. If you hang out there, you will be guaranteed to see characters like Peter Pan, the Evil Queen, any of the princesses and Mary Poppins.\n\nThere’s also one at the very end of Critter Country, by the Splash Mountain exit. You will often seen Winnie the Pooh characters rotating in and out of there. There is also a character entrance/exit by the bathrooms next to the Disney Junior show in California Adventure, but the only characters you’ll see there are Disney Junior folks.\n\n \n\nTHE WEATHER\nRainy days aren’t what they used to be; I have seen rainy Sundays as busy as any other weekend. People assume rainy days and holidays (or even Super Bowl Sunday) would be a great time to visit, but they’re as bad or worse than other days. Check the isitpacked crowd forecaster for an idea of what the crowd levels will be like once you are there. It might help plan your day better; maybe get there early and ride rides all morning long and by late morning/early afternoon, you can do all the stuff you don’t really need to worry about lines for, like the Tiki Room and the Magical Map show.\n\nThere are a handful of places with reliable air conditioning to relax and beat the heat in Disneyland (Tiki Room, Main Street Cinema, Great Moments with Mr Lincoln, Star Wars Launch Bay) and California Adventure Park (Animation Academy). There are also water play areas in Bug’s Land; kids have to wear their shoes, but there are family bathrooms nearby to change into and out of swimsuits.\n\nPARADES\nIf you plan on waiting for a parade, it is important to ask which direction it’s coming from — that will determine the best place to sit for the view. If you don’t care about the fireworks show, one of the best places for parade watching is in front of Small World; there’s no foot traffic so kids can run around in the parade area — and less people camp out there — making for good views in either direction.\n\nThe best place to watch the nighttime parade and have a great view of the fireworks is slightly to the right in front of the castle, at the junction of the road that heads up to the Matterhorn and the island where the Disney statue is. If the parade is coming from Small World, you will have an unobstructed view of the floats as they come down the road from the Matterhorn; after the parade, you can immediately shift your view to the castle and you should have a perfect view of the castle and fireworks.\n\nWhat are your top tips for navigating Disneyland in California?

For those looking to avoid the crowds and get back to basics, perhaps a less traditional lodging option is a better idea, especially one that playfully reinterprets the treehouse of your childhood, resulting in a whimsical — and slightly nostalgic — take on luxury accommodations. With eco-friendly construction and unique design elements, hotel owners have branched out and created fully functional, and sometimes quite posh, escapes in the sky. If you’re ready to go out on a limb (pun intended), grab a friend with a sense of adventure — and, preferably, not a fear of heights — and get ready to literally elevate your next vacation!\n\n1.

          "description": "The tale is one of piety, devotion, charity: Ibrahim is to sacrifice his son per God’s request but before his sword can fall, God recognizes Ibrahim’s commitment and spares his son’s life, offering instead a sacrificial ram.\n\nToday, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha in commemoration of Ibrahim’s faithfulness and God’s mercy. The holiday is one of the holiest on the lunar calendar and marks the end of hajj, the yearly pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. Eid al-Adha is marked by days of prayer, gathering, and feast.\n\nIn New York City, Honest Chops, a halal butcher shop in Manhattan’s East Village, delivers more than cuts of meat in anticipation of Eid. Khalid Latif, a cofounder and co-owner, brings to his business a communal sensibility that guides the shop’s practice. Latif also serves as chaplain and director of the Islamic Center at New York University.\n\nI spoke to Latif in the days leading up to Eid. He talked community and the importance of udhiya, the practice of donating meat to those in need so they can properly celebrate the holiday on their own. The following is from our conversation, edited for clarity and flow.\n\nWhat Muslims Around the World Are Making for Eid\nby Lail Hossain | Founder WithASpin, LLC\n\nHonest Chops came about because there weren't any halal meat stores in Manhattan. There were some in the outer boroughs and there were some stores in Manhattan that would sell halal meat in addition to other things. But there was no dedicated store that only engaged halal meat as its primary product distribution. Honest Chops also came up as an idea when I was trying to brainstorm with some friends how we could create some revenue streams that could go into building out social services that were needed in the community.\n\nAround the upcoming Eid holiday, you are encouraged to slaughter an animal and distribute the meat to people who are in need. Last year, we distributed about three or four thousand pounds of meat to 200 families in need in the extended area.\n\nWhat we're looking to do is to create opportunities for people who are local. There's a lot of food insecurity and hunger issues in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Processes of gentrification tend towards individuals who have lived in certain neighborhoods for generations but get priced out because the incoming stores are charging a lot more than they can afford.\n\nNavigating the Holidays in a Mixed-Faith Family\nby Mayukh Sen\n\nThe meat itself gets delivered to the slaughter facilities that we work with, they slaughter it in the halal fashion, and then the meat gets taken to our butchery. And now this is where it just gets hectic, we've got to break down all these animals and process them in a meaningful way for the people we're distributing them to. We try to divide them into ten to twenty pound bags—some people opt to have the entire portion distributed to people in need, others keep a component of it for themselves. So it's about ensuring that everything is done as per the ritual but that it also reaches people in the best state possible so that there's no real distinction between what they're receiving and what our customers would receive if they walked into the store and bought it for themselves. We feel that everyone should be treated exactly the same.\n\nIn New York City, the beautiful thing you will find is just how deep Islam is as a tradition. There is an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Muslims here and about 200 places for them to pray. Many mosques tend to cater to prevailing cultures, so you'll have a Bengali mosque, a Nigerian mosque, a Turkish mosque, an Albanian mosque. And within that, you'll find people eating the foods that are of their cultures, all that fall under Islamic dietary restrictions. So if you go to a Malaysian mosque, people are going to be eating Malaysian food, celebrating Malaysian holidays. You go to a community like ours where we have people from everywhere, you'll find everything from South Asian food to soul food to Chinese food. And it’s a mix that really caters to the overall experience that you can uniquely find in a city like this. Every aspect of it has some element of communal and social equity. You're sharing with people and enabling everyone to come together. Food varies from culture to culture, but Eid is a celebration, a holiday. One of the reasons it’s encouraged to distribute this meat to local people who are in need is so that they can also celebrate the holiday as meaningfully as possible.",

          "description": "People usually get promotions because of their outstanding achievements and success. But most good leaders realize a strange paradox while climbing the career ladder. As Sarah Thompson, CEO of global advertising firm Droga5, tells the New York Times: “There’s less glory the more senior you get.”\n\nIn a “Corner Office” interview with Adam Bryant, Thompson explains that her management philosophy involves directing her energy outward. “You have to constantly be thinking about how you’re going to make the whole team better. To do that, you have to be kind of selfless. It’s not about winning the meeting or feeling that people would be lost without you.”\n\nThe inverse relationship between seniority and glory can be uncomfortable for a lot of top performers. After all, studies show that from childhood, the right kind of praise makes us more intelligent, happy, and successful. But good management means caring less about getting credit, and more about giving it. Thompson’s advice represents an essential shift in mindset: What if we viewed promotion as commemorating one’s judgment, rather than one’s ability to execute difficult tasks? In this sense, seniority honors one’s ability to facilitate, not spearhead, success—to listen to others, develop good organizational strategies, and shepherd teams toward progress.\n\nDavid Hassell, CEO of the software company 15Five, also promotes the notion that leaders should think of themselves as conductors, not champions. To communicate his values, he flips his company’s organizational chart upside-down. “Think of the CEO as the trunk of the tree — the one who holds and supports everyone in the organization to grow and keep the vision alive,” he writes on LinkedIn. “The support trickles up into the branches … It’s a shift from a management perspective of what can I get from you, to what do you need from me?” Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, also riffs on this perspective, explaining that business leaders ought to be “learn-it-alls,” not “know-it-alls.”\n\nThis mindset benefits leaders themselves as well as the people they manage. As Emily Esfahani Smith, author of The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters, explains in Quartz, the 20th-century psychologist Erik Erikson theorized that in order to lead a meaningful life, humans had to master a certain value or skill at each developmental stage. The most significant task of adulthood, according to Erikson, is “generativity”—which Esfahani describes as “cultivating the next generation, or helping other people to accomplish their goals and reach their potential.”\n\n“In other words, you’re a successful adult when you outgrow the natural selfishness of your childhood and youth—when you realize that life is no longer about charting your own course, but about helping others, whether it’s by raising children, mentoring colleagues, or creating something new and useful for the world,” writes Esfahani. “Generative people perceive themselves as part of a larger tapestry and seek to preserve it, however humbly, for future generations. This legacy gives their lives meaning.”\n\nThe idea that “there’s less glory the more senior you get” is inherently generative. Enacting this mantra demands great humility. But doing so makes leaders more open and receptive to the feedback, ideas, and collaboration necessary for ongoing group success.\n\nChallenging as it may be to adopt this mindset, the result is a happier, more productive team. “It took me a while to realize that people are going to do things differently than me,” says Thompson. “I had to learn that it’s about setting up the outcomes and quality you want, and giving people more and more freedom to achieve that.”\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

          "description": "There’s a wave of excitement whenever a transferable loyalty currency adds a new partner. We all want to know if the new partner will add value to the currency or if it’ll be another program to completely avoid. Citi recently announced that, effective immediately, you can transfer your ThankYou points at a 1:1 ratio to Star Alliance member Turkish Airlines. Today, I’ll tell you everything you need to know about the Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles program and show you how to get the most value from any ThankYou points you decide to transfer.\n\nMost people who are familiar with the Miles & Smiles program have used the it to earn Star Alliance Gold status in order to have things like domestic United Club access. Miles & Smiles has been routinely offering status matches and challenges for the last few years. If you call and speak with phone agents or look for a landing page on the Turkish Airlines site, you’d believe nothing is available. However, according to this FlyerTalk thread, you can request a match via this web form.\n\nUtilize a Turkish status match to always have access to the new lounge at IAD or United Clubs when flying domestically.\nThe match is now reportedly only good for a four-month trial period, during which you must fly one international segment on Turkish metal to extend the match to a period of one year. Earning 15,000 status miles during that year will extend the status match for an additional year. Lately, however, flyers are having a hard time getting Turkish to honor the challenge agreement after completing 15,000 status miles, and their accounts are not being updated.\n\nOne final note before we dive into the details: The redesigned Turkish Airlines website can be difficult to navigate — if you’re having trouble getting links to load or finding the information you’re looking for, try reverting to the previous version of the website. You’ll find a link for doing so at the bottom of the homepage.\n\nEarn Miles (& Smiles)\n\nUntil this week, the only avenues for Americans to earn miles with Turkish were crediting paid Star Alliance flights to Turkish Airlines or redeeming Marriott points for Night + Hotel packages. These packages can earn you up to 85,000 Turkish miles plus seven hotel nights.\n\nWith the ability to now transfer ThankYou points at a 1:1 ratio, you can use points earned from your Citi Prestige Card, Citi ThankYou Premier and Citi AT&T Access More (no longer available for new sign ups) to quickly pad your Turkish account.\n\nThe next-easiest way to earn miles is when flying United Airlines. You can enter your Turkish number on your reservation in lieu of United and earn Miles & Smiles miles based on the following partner chart:\n\nEarn miles when flying any other Star Alliance carrier or when flying Jet Airways, LATAM and Turkish regional airline AnadoluJet.\n\nIn addition to flights, you can earn miles at 29 different hotel partners — typically a flat 500 miles per stay, or at chains like Marriott and Hilton, between 1 and 2 miles per dollar spent. You can also earn miles on hotel stays for bookings made from Pointshound.com and Rocketmiles.com. Earn up to 1,000 miles per rental from 11 different car rental companies. Earn up to 3,000 miles with rentals from Enterprise through September 30.\n\nIf you happen to be a resident of Turkey, a plethora of partners are available for you to earn miles. Some of the most unique include medical expenses, college tuition, Shell station gas fill-ups and buying Madam Tussauds Wax Museum tickets. Unfortunately, there don’t appear to be any further viable options for Americans to earn Turkish miles.\n\nRedeem Miles (& Smiles)\n\nThe Miles & Smiles program definitely has a few idiosyncrasies and basic rules you need to understand before deciding to redeem miles. I recommend reading through the FAQs if you aren’t familiar with the program.\n\nHere are a few of the most important rules to know:\n\nMiles expire three years from the time they are earned. You can pay $10 for every 1,000 miles that are about to expire and extend them for another three years.\n\nFuel surcharges can be excessive.\n\nIf you need 10,000 miles or less to issue an award ticket, you can buy them at a rate of 25 euros per 1,000 miles.\n\nThe program rules state you must have Star Alliance award tickets issued from a physical Turkish ticket office. Some people make a trek in person, but there are several reports of being able to call and have ticket offices complete the transaction over email or the phone. Turkish has offices in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. FlyerTalk reports the Toronto office is able to ticket over email; contact YTO.INFO@THY.COM.\n\nYou can redeem miles for someone else, but the website says the request must be made in writing. Miles & Smiles members should have a signed written request that includes name, surname, birth date and relationship to the member of the person to whom the award will be issued. You also need to share departure and arrival points, travel dates and a photocopy of your Miles & Smiles membership card, a valid ID and a written, signed request. The program says you must also complete the process to redeem miles for a spouse.\n\nTransferring and combining miles is not allowed.\n\nThe redemption scheme for Miles & Smiles at face value is quite simple. There are two region-based charts. The more expensive chart is called Seat Guaranteed, which is like a standard-level award ticket and applicable only to Turkish-operated flights. Second, the less expensive Capacity Controlled chart shows prices for the equivalent of a saver level ticket. Seats at these prices are subject to award seat availability and applicable to Turkish and Star Alliance-operated flights.\n\nYou can easily redeem miles online for Turkish-operated flights but the site won’t show you the required fuel surcharges unless you have the required miles in your account:\n\nA unique feature of Miles & Smiles is the ability to redeem miles for a companion ticket when flying a round-trip revenue flight operated by Turkish Airlines. With companion tickets, there are also capacity-controlled and seat guaranteed levels of miles required. A round-trip Atlanta-Istanbul companion ticket will cost 42,000 miles and $290 compared to 60,000 miles and $300 for an award ticket.\n\nIn addition to free flights, you can redeem miles at Shop and Miles and receive free merchandise. Turkish residents can also redeem miles for free gas at Shell stations. As always, these represent poor value and I recommend sticking to award flights.\n\nAward Ticket Fees\n\nMileage refund (assuming a no-show has not occurred): $25 for domestic ticket, $50 for international\n\nDate/time/routing change (only allowed for Turkish-operated segments for changes within the same award zones): $25\n\nNo-show fee: $50\n\nAward Routing Rules\n\nYou can redeem miles for one-way awards at half the price shown in the award charts.\n\nYou cannot mix carriers on the outbound or inbound legs ( or you’ll be charged two awards) and can never mix cabins of service.\n\nOne stopover is permitted for award flights on Turkish Airlines.\n\nFor Star Alliance awards, one stopover is allowed for economy tickets that cost a minimum of 60,000 miles, for business tickets with a minimum cost of 90,000 miles, and for first class tickets with a minimum cost of 135,000 miles.\n\nTickets can have a maximum of 8 segments.\n\nBacktracking is allowed, but the same airport cannot appear more than once in the outbound or inbound legs. There are no enforced Maximum Permitted Mileages (MPMs), but if you transit via a third region that’s more expensive than your destination, you’ll be charged the higher price.\n\nOne open jaw is permitted on round-trip itineraries.\n\nMiles & Smiles Sweet Spots\n\nThe first place to start when looking for sweet spots in region-based charts are the region definitions. In Miles & Smiles, there’s an expansive, single Far East region which covers everything from Japan to Sri Lanka. Round-trip flights within the region cost a great 40,000, 70,000 and 110,000 round-trip for economy, business and first class respectively, with one-ways costing half those totals. That means seven-hour routes like Tokyo to Singapore or Tokyo to Bangkok in Thai, Singapore or ANA business class are available for 35,000 miles.\n\nThe next region to look at is North America, which includes the US along with Bermuda, Canada, Mexico and Netherlands Antilles. Here are the round-trip prices for intra-North America flights:\n\nThat means lie-flat transcons on United for 12,500 miles cost each way. Before you get too excited, Turkish somehow manages to put extensive fuel surcharges even on domestic flights; expect to pay $117 per leg. Even then, 12,500 ThankYou points and $117 for IAD-SFO in BusinessFirst is a heck of a deal. Remember you can also visit the Caribbean (Saint Maarten and Curacao included) for those prices.\n\nThat means pending United availability, you could fly San Francisco – Newark – Saint Maarten- Washington – San Francisco all in business class for 25,000 miles and ~$300:\n\nLooking at the rest of the award chart, here are a few regions and example routes that look like good deals, pending fuel surcharges:\n\nRoute\n\nClass\n\nCost (One-Way)\n\nMunich – Tokyo – Bangkok\n\nBusiness\n\n45,000\n\nSydney – Honolulu\n\nEconomy\n\n15,000\n\nNew York – Frankfurt – Dubai\n\nBusiness\n\n47,000\n\nFrankfurt – Capetown\n\nBusiness\n\n45,000\n\nMunich – Dubai\n\nBusiness\n\n24,500\n\nBrazil – Bogota – London\n\nBusiness\n\n52,500\n\nSydney – Delhi – Paris\n\nBusiness\n\n60,000\n\nChicago – Mumbai\n\nBusiness\n\n52,500\n\nTurkish Airlines itself has a great business-class product, and round-trip from North America to Turkey only costs 90,000 miles. These flights are redeemable online and should also be an option you consider.\n\nPromos\n\nThe last item to keep an eye on for good deals with Miles & Smiles are the promos which routinely show on the special offers page. Now through September 14, you can book award travel from Istanbul to the Seychelles in business and economy for 50% off the required mileage. That means almost 18 hours in business class for 45,000 miles. Travel must be completed by December 31, 2017.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOften-significant fuel surcharges and a tedious award-booking process are notable barriers to entry for many people who would otherwise try to use Miles & Smiles. What that means to me is few people will take advantage of this great program and we hopefully won’t see any kind of devaluation in the near future. A 1:1 transfer ratio from Citi, 12,500 miles for domestic business class and several award sweet spots make Miles & Smiles an incredibly tempting destination for my ThankYou points.\n\nHave you booked a Miles & Smiles award ticket?\n",

          "description": "Stocking a spice cabinet can be a little overwhelming, simply for the reason that there are so many spices out there. It may be tempting to stock up on every exciting seasoning in sight, but these things do have an expiration date, and you can end up with a cabinet full of flavorless, expensive powders that need to be replaced.\n\nThis is part of The Grown Up Kitchen, Skillet’s series designed to answer your most basic culinary questions and fill in any gaps that may be missing in your home chef education.\n\nChicken breasts are not very exciting, but they are a versatile protein with a pretty healthy…\n\nRead more\n\nBut nobody likes bland food, and there are a few spices that I recommend everyone have on hand. Once you have these basics, you can supplement with the other spices that routinely come up in your favorite recipes.\n\nSalt: Salt makes other flavors pop. Get a box of Kosher salt for cooking and a box of Maldon for finishing.\n\nPepper: Skip the pre-ground stuff and get a grinder with whole black or rainbow peppercorns. (Extra credit: Get another one with white peppercorns for times when you need to increase the funk.)\n\nCinnamon: You’ll need whole sticks for infusions and teas, and ground for baking and sprinkling into savory dishes. It may sound weird, but adding a pinch of cinnamon to my beef stew changed my life.\n\nWhole nutmeg: Freshly ground nutmeg is my “secret ingredient” in a whole slew of recipes. Yes, it’s great in baked goods, but it’s also fantastic in any sort of cheesy dish and pairs well with hearty meats and starchy vegetables. I also love it grated directly onto a rum cocktail.\n\nGround cayenne: Cayenne pepper is a versatile heat-bringer used in a variety of cuisines, and just a pinch can add a nice kick to a vat of beans or take your spice rub up a notch.\n\nPaprika: Paprika is the bright red pugent powder you may have seen on top of deviled eggs. Paprika can be mild, sweet, or hot, but it should always be Hungarian. Beyond deviled eggs, you can use it to finish any dish that needs a bit of pungency, or use it in spice rubs, marinades, and dressings.\n\nCumin: I am obsessed with cumin and it’s sweet, earthy, warm flavor. It makes meaty dishes taste “complete,” and absolutely sings in both Tex-Mex and curries alike. When I taste a dish and think it needs “an extra something,” that something is usually cumin.\n\nDried thyme: Fresh herbs are great when you can get them, but you should enjoy thyme’s woodsy flavor all year round. It’s a staple in Mediterranean and Italian cooking, and adds subtle flavor to a whole slew of savory dishes.\n\nDried oregano: Like thyme, oregano has year-round applications, and my spaghetti sauce wouldn’t be the same with out it.\n\nBay leaves: Bay leaves are like the perfect back up singer, and provide harmony without being distracting. Their subtle, savory and vaguely medicinal flavor makes rice, soups, and stews taste better without making them taste like much at all.\n\nCrushed red pepper flakes: Made from a blend of dried, crushed chilies, these spicy little guys add a slightly fruity spiciness to anything you sprinkle them on, such as pizza, pizza, or pizza. (I also use them in my marinated mushrooms, but c’mon, we all know crushed red pepper is made for pizza.)\n\nOf course, spice cabinets will vary from person to person, depending on the type of cuisines one cooks, and that’s a beautiful thing. What spices can you absolutely not live without, and what have you found to be skippable?\n",

          "description": "American jobs are grueling, according to a newly published RAND survey.\n\nFor the first time in 2015, the nonprofit think tank asked its nationally representative survey panel about their attitudes toward the workplace. “The portrait that emerges is of a workplace that is taxing on a lot of dimensions,” says Nicole Maestas, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study, which was published Aug. 14. “It’s hectic, fast-paced, and jobs can be emotionally and physically taxing.”\n\nAmong the survey’s results:\n\nNearly three-fourths of Americans report either intense or repetitive physical exertion on the job at least one-quarter of the time.\n\nMore than one-half of Americans report exposure to unpleasant and potentially hazardous working conditions.\n\nNearly one in five Americans are exposed to a hostile or threatening social environment at work, such as unwanted sexual attention and verbal abuse.\n\nMost Americans (two-thirds) frequently work at high speeds or under tight deadlines, and one in four perceives that they have too little time to do their job.\n\nAbout one-half of American workers do some work in their free time to meet work demands.\n\nOnly 38% of workers state that their job offers good prospects for advancement.\n\nNot all of these burdens are equally distributed. Non-graduate workers, for instance, were more likely to report intense or repetitive physical exertion as well as unpleasant and potentially hazardous working conditions. They were less likely to control their own schedules, and more than one in five non-college-graduate, prime-age workers (age 35–49) were subject to frequent changes to their work schedules.\n\nOther burdens, like working under time pressure, were more evenly distributed among those who did and did not graduate from college, though in different forms: Non-graduates were more likely to work at high speeds, while graduates were more likely to face deadline pressure.\n\n“The incidence of these poor working conditions falls harder on workers without a college degree, “Maestas says. “But even there I was surprised in how taxing work can be even for college educated workers.”\n\nPeople did report some upsides. For instance, workers tend to turn to each other for support. More than half of workers described their bosses as supportive, and 56% said that they had very good friends at work.\n\nRAND also asked survey respondents about three sources of meaning in their work. Did they feel : “satisfaction of work well done,” “feeling of doing useful work,” “sense of personal accomplishment,” “make positive impact on community/society,” “opportunities to fully use talents,” and “goals to aspire to?”\n\nAbout 80% said their job provides at least one of those things always or most of the time.",

          "description": "A researcher explains why Trump seriously missed the mark.\n\nAfter white supremacists held violent rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Friday and Saturday, President Donald Trump had a chance to denounce the hate and bigotry that led to the current situation during a Saturday bill signing ceremony. Instead, he blamed “many sides.”\n\n“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s false equivalency quickly drew a lot of criticism on Twitter. But Phillip Abita Goff, a researcher who focuses on race and policing issues at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, perhaps said it best in a series of tweets:\n\n1. The deaths from racial violence in the US have not been on many sides. Separation of parents from children have not been on many sides. https://t.co/vDIciGDFX9\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n2. The forced sterilization has not been on many sides. The government-enforced segregation has not been on many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n3. The forced relocation has not been on many sides. The stolen labor has not been on many sides. Media erasure has not been on many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n4. Police-sanctioned lynchings have not been on many sides. Broken treaties and stolen land have not been on many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n5. Immigration enforcement has not been equally applied to many sides. Beauty standards have not represented many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n6. Segregated schools do not advantage many sides. Rape culture does not create vulnerable people from many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n7. Music traditions were not coopted and sold for profit from many sides. The constitution didn't count 3/5ths of a person from many sides.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n8. Justice frequently does not have many sides. When powerful groups harm less powerful groups, there is not a need for mutual apology.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n9. False equivalency is a lie that renders the powerful as victims. And it is a violence to those who are not equal save for that lie.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\n10. Poverty and exploitation do not have many sides. People did not die in #Charlottesville on many sides. And justice cannot say otherwise.\n\n— Phillip Atiba Goff (@DrPhilGoff) August 12, 2017\n\nIn short, there aren’t multiple morally equivalent sides here. There’s one side — white supremacists — that has long oppressed all other groups of people. Their protests aim to ensure that oppression continues, even if it means using violence. The people counterprotesting, on the other hand, are trying to end that oppression.\n\nSo while it’s true that both sides participated in the brawls seen throughout the protests, one side — in a country that supposedly values equality — has the much stronger case by actively working against the hate, bigotry, and violence that the white supremacist side is actively trying to perpetuate.\n\nBut Trump won’t acknowledge any of that. Asked to clarify his remarks, a White House official said, “The President was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides. There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.” Trump is deliberately not calling out the white supremacists who led to the unrest in Charlottesville.",

          "description": "About half of Republicans would support postponing the 2020 election so the country can address claims of voter fraud, according to a new poll by the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog.\n\nThe poll posed a hypothetical question: If Donald Trump were to say that the 2020 presidential election should be postponed until the country can make sure that only eligible American citizens can vote, would you support or oppose postponing the election?\n\nFifty-two percent said that they would support the idea of postponing the 2020 election until voter fraud is addressed, and 56 percent said they would support this decision if both Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed it.\n\nThis was just a hypothetical question. Trump claims voter fraud cost him the popular vote in 2016 (a claim with no evidence to back it up), but there’s no indication that he’d seriously consider postponing the election.\n\nThe survey also started with a series of questions about typical arguments made by Trump concerning voter fraud, including whether Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 election and whether millions of illegal immigrants vote. That led to a critique that survey respondents were primed by those questions to be more concerned about fraud than they otherwise would be:\n\nAnswers to questions will always be correlated when you evoke one previously-asked question in the other one. https://t.co/prrshA2HOx http://pic.twitter.com/48Ak7bawBn\n\n— Natalie Jackson (@nataliemjb) August 10, 2017\n\nStill, the authors — Ariel Malka, an associate professor of psychology at Yeshiva, and Yphtach Lelkes, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania — suggest the results are worth paying attention to.

          "description": "Donald Trump's ideal economy is defined by brawn. He praises steelworkers, speaks wistfully of coal mining, and tweets boastfully about new manufacturing factories. But 200 days into his presidency, the most promising sector of the U.S. labor market isn’t steel-plating. It’s dinner-plating.\n\nRestaurant jobs are on fire in 2017, growing faster than health care, construction, or manufacturing. They account for just 1 percent of the economy, but they’ve accounted for 10 percent of this year’s job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calls this subsector “food services and drinking places,” and the jobs are mostly at sit-down restaurants, which make up 50 percent of the category. Fast-food joints are the next-largest employer in the category, with 37 percent. Bars—wonderful, plentiful, but leanly staffed—account for just 3 percent. So, I’m just going to keep saying “restaurants” for short.\n\nRestaurants > Health Care\nBLS\n\nIn some metros, restaurants are powering the entire economy. More than a third of Cleveland’s new jobs since 2015 are in restaurants, according to EMSI data. The same is true for New Orleans, but since 2010.\n\nUnlike mining or manufacturing, which tends to cluster in a handful of regions, the restaurant boom is spread across the country. New fine-dining restaurants, which tend to require more waitstaff, are blooming in all the predictable places—San Francisco, Nashville, and Austin (the Texas capital leads the country in percent-growth of restaurant jobs). But restaurants are dominating local economies in a diverse range of places, from poor metros like Little Rock, to rich places like Washington, D.C., and military hubs like Virginia Beach.\n\nThe Restaurants Are Eating the Jobs\nJosh Wright / EMSI\n\nHow did this happen? As Justin Fox points out, the trend didn't appear overnight. For the past three decades, restaurants have steadily grown, as part of the most fundamental shift in American work—from making things to serving people. Between 1990 and 2008, 98 percent of new jobs came from so-called \"nontradable\" industries that aren't sensitive to international trade, according to the economist Michael Spence.\n\nIn 1990, manufacturing was almost three times larger than the food service industry. But restaurants have gradually closed the gap. At current rates of growth, more people will work at restaurants than in manufacturing in 2020. This mirrors the shift in consumer spending. Restaurants’ share of America’s food budget has doubled from 25 percent in the 1950s to 50 percent today.\n\nThe phenomenon is speeding up. Four of the five best years for restaurant growth on record have happened since 2011. Restaurant jobs have grown faster than the overall economy every month since August 2010. (That’s more than 200 consecutive months!) It’s not just a redundant artifact of the service-sector economy, either. Almost every month between 1996 and 2000—years when job creation soared in a booming economy—restaurant jobs grew slower than the rest of the labor market.\n\nThe trend is speeding up, but it’s not clear that we should cheer it—or whether it’s sustainable. Jobs are jobs, but these ones don’t pay very well. The typical private-sector job pays about $22 an hour. The typical restaurant job pays about $12.50. That’s one reason why the Fight for 15 movement to raise the minimum wage has targeted the restaurant industry. What’s more, although it might feel like a golden age of restaurants in America, the truth is that the United States might have too many restaurants, particularly “family-casual” chains like Applebee’s, which have struggled to keep up with rising labor costs.\n\nBut the most important feature of the restaurant jobs boom is not what it may say about the future, but rather the fact that it is happening in the first place. Trump and other politicians often say they want to help the common worker. But then they talk about the economy as if it were cryogenically frozen sometime around 1957. The U.S. still makes stuff, but mostly it serves stuff. To help American workers, it helps to begin with an honest accounting of what Americans actually do.",

Is making, wearing, and selling fake clothing brands acceptable in Islam (halal) or forbidden (haram)? Are you having a bad day and want someone to talk to? Well, worry no more.\n\nEgypt’s top Islamic authority has set up a booth in the capital’s busy al-Shohada subway station in a bid to offer commuters religious advice, or fatwas. Al-Azhar, Egypt’s oldest university and Sunni Islam’s most prestigious institution of higher learning, says the move is part of an effort to counter extremism, correct misinterpretations of Islam, and discuss daily challenges affecting Muslims.\n\nThe fatwa kiosk is open to the public between 9 am and 8 pm every day of the week, except during the Friday weekend. The sheikhs manning the booth say they have discussed issues relating to marriage, inheritance, and divorce, besides providing guidance on setting up businesses and the collection and payment of interest, or usury.\n\n“The best thing you can do for someone is lend them a willing ear when they are troubled,” Sheikh Ahmed Ramzy El Saber, told Cairo Scene. “People are extremely busy, they have places to be, things to do, and mouths to feed. Therefore, we thought that we should go to them, instead of have them spend their valuable time looking for us.”\n\nThe fatwa kiosk comes at a time when the north African nation is in a state of emergency following twin church attacks that killed at least 45 people in April while facing an insurgency in the restive Sinai Peninsula. Young people, disaffected by economic stagnation are increasingly turning to violence and volunteering with Islamic State and al-Qaeda.\n\nAl-Azhar clerics answers a womans’ question inside a Fatwa Kiosk, at the Al Shohada’a metro station, in Cairo.\n\nThe move towards extremism has worried both the government and the imams at Al-Azhar, especially as more young people turn online to connect with jihadists and get radicalized. Last year, while presiding over the security council, Egypt’s government invited Microsoft to help it and other governments confront violent extremism. Al-Azhar also created a portal (link in Arabic) to counter erroneous messages about Islam propagated by terrorist groups online.\n\nBut the institution has itself clashed with the government on how best to institute theological reforms within the Islamic religion. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has positioned himself as a secular leader, in contrast to the Muslim Brotherhood-backed leader Mohamed Morsi, whom he ousted in 2013.\n\nThe decision to erect the booths have also sparked criticism, with some saying that it encroaches on personal liberties and brings religion into public spaces. And in a country with a 10% Christian population, some have decried the idea while other have called for Coptic priests to be allowed to set up booths in subways too. “This is not its place at all,” said Beshoy Mikhail, a 24-year-old Coptic Christian, told the Associated Press. “I am completely against the idea.”\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.\n",

          "description": "In 2013, Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley walked into a bakery and bought a cake. Almond, with meringue on top. It was sweet—but the milestone was sweeter.\n\nFor more than a decade—since his grad school days—he’d been pursuing one big idea: a product that understands how users move through the world so well, it can deliver timely, personalized tips. That idea had evolved through several iterations, from a startup called Dodgeball to the founding of Foursquare.\n\nWhen he bought the cake, the company best known for “checking in” was several years into something bigger, developing mobile software that would recognize users’ locations and automatically push tailored recommendations.\n\nOne of the developers gave Crowley a phone with a new build and told him to go for a walk with it. The Foursquare founder went down the street towards Little Cupcake Bakeshop. The phone lit up and pinged him to let him know he was near the bakery and what people like to get there. On the list? The dreaming princess cake.\n\nIt had worked: the phone knew where Crowley was and offered useful information, without any input from him. Needless to say, there was dreaming princess cake for everyone in the office that afternoon.\n\nThat game-changing moment would be followed by a thousand mini-breakthroughs: cutting the time it took for the phone to ping, for example, or better distinguishing between two neighboring stores. “Those changes are harder to notice,” says Crowley. “The moment it goes from not working to working is the big moment.”\n\nIn this exclusive interview, he urges founders to think audaciously, and to push toward their own big moments. Crowley examines six facets to tenacity and how each can drive a company forward differently. He shares advice for how to pursue an idea for the long haul—and, as importantly, how to inspire and mobilize the rest of your team to care about it, too.\n\nTenacity as identity\n\nThe germ of tenacity can be as much about a great idea as one’s self-identification with it. “Sometimes you just have to build it to prove to yourself that it works or doesn’t. It’s as much about if and why it works, as your agency in it,” says Crowley.\n\nTake his first experiment, Dodgeball. The initial version was essentially just a city guide, wherein users could write reviews of places they’d been. This was around 2000; the guide wasn’t mobile, and crowdsourced content was still relatively unheard of. In fact, everyone in the space told him it couldn’t work—editors were necessary for a reason. “People said it’s a bad idea,” says Crowley. “I lulled myself into thinking the same. It’s not going to work. So we didn’t build it.”\n\nSo what changed? Quite simply, this product was something Crowley himself wanted to use. The idea stuck in his mind, needling him, and he had to see if it could work. “To build it was almost like fulfilling a need to express myself. So that was the project I learned how to code for. I taught myself out of one of those big ‘Learn to Code in 30 Days’ books,” he says, “Personally, it was fulfilling. Externally, it wasn’t a huge success. A couple of thousand people used it.”\n\nBut it laid the groundwork for Dodgeball Version 2.0, the prevailing version when Crowley founded a company by the same name in 2004. “I was on the product and engineering team of Vindigo at the time, and we would say, wouldn’t it be crazy if you could see where all of your friends had been? You wouldn’t have to read the reviews—you could just go to the places they’d been.”\n\nAgain there were naysayers, and again Crowley knew he needed to see if it could be done the way he would do it—and if anyone else wanted to use it. “I wanted this thing to exist. I thought, It doesn’t seem like anyone else is going to build this, so I’ll go build it.”\n\nAround that time, as fate would have it, Crowley and several of his friends were laid off. “We were trying to find each other around the city,” he said. They had a need, and the time and skill-set to meet it. “We wanted a way that you could just check in at an East Village bar and that’s how you would know to go find someone. Looking back the idea was there, we just needed a community to form around it.”\n\n If, after several turns in your career and life, you return to the same idea, pursue it. Your creation is as much an act of self-expression at that point.  \n\nDodgeball introduced the world to the concept of “checking in,” and it turned out, lots of other people wanted it. “I thought, ‘If only ten of my friends use this, it’s fine because it helped us.’ We found that if you can build something that you’re interested in and your ten friends are really into, there’s a good chance that their ten friends will be into it, and their friends as well,” says Crowley. “My lesson is that you’ll need more than yourself eventually, but not much more. Don’t give up until you can go after it with at least ten friends.”\n\nSoon, more than ten friends became interested. Crowley teamed up with Alex Rainert at NYU, where he started to refine the idea. Dodgeball went from a side project to a full-blown thesis. Google took note, too, and bought Dodgeball in 2005. A couple of years later, though, Crowley was itching to take his idea further.\n\nTenacity as confidence (tempered with humility)\n\nEven after achieving success—Dodgeball’s sale to Google, Foursquare’s buzzed-about debut at 2009’s SXSW—Crowley encountered resistance.\n\nBut one key ingredient of tenacity? Persistence. “When we pitched Foursquare to investors, the feedback universally was ‘You already made this and you already sold it. Google ultimately didn’t want it and it didn’t work. Why would I ever invest in you doing the same thing again?’” recounts Crowley.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t the same thing. In just a few years, phones had changed dramatically, as had the ways people engaged online and with their social networks. But just as you need to believe in your idea enough to build it, you need to believe enough to sell it—even if you yourself aren’t sure where you’re going to end up.\n\n“We knew from Dodgeball that if we got a bunch of people checking in, there was really interesting trends at work in that data. We didn’t know the full extent of what Foursquare would become years later, but we knew there was something buried in the data,” says Crowley. “And we know the idea of checking in, especially when combined with game mechanics, would get people to give us the data.”\n\nDon’t confuse confidence in your mission with hubris, though. There will still be expert outside voices who can see things you don’t. When you find trustworthy counsel, listen to what they have to say.\n\nFor Crowley, that came in the form of venture capitalist Charlie O’Donnell, who was able to see the winning pitch for Foursquare before its founders could. “We were out there describing how we would build a personalized guide to the world from all our data. As we were pitching, Charlie wrote a blog post called ‘Why Yelp — and every single retail establishment—should support Foursquare.’” With a little distance, O’Donnell could see the story that investors and merchants would respond to. “His was a very clear articulation of what Foursquare offers. It’s this force that drives people to places. They check in. Merchants see that, and offer specials to encourage more check-ins. There’s an ecosystem there.”\n\nCrowley and his team understood that ecosystem, of course, but couldn’t take their eyes off the endgame. “We were like, ‘No! Personalized guide! Personalized guide!’ It took conversations with investors before we really realized what the story could be at that point. There was money to be made with merchants and with the data that helped them understand where consumers were going and what they liked. Once we started to understand the storyline that investors found compelling, we combined it with the narrative that we had crafted on our own. That’s when it turned into something real.”\n\nTenacity as focus\n\nIn the commotion of launching a company, though, it can be hard to distinguish between wise voices and noise, between the ideas that move you forward and the ones that sidetrack you.\n\nCrowley’s advice to founders is to articulate—and then frequently check-in with—their North Star. How to do that? “Keep asking: ‘what’s this supposed to be when it grows up?’” he says. “We’ve always had an orienting grand vision, sometimes to a fault: build products that generate information about where people are going and use that data to create products that make it easier for them to navigate the real world.”\n\nBut there was a moment, Crowley now recalls, when he and his cofounders thought they should perhaps pivot to being “the check-in-to-everything company.” It was 2010, and new imitators were cropping up every day, applying Foursquare’s concept to anything from events to meals. “There was this whole movement: you’ll check into TV shows and check into articles. We laugh at it now, but we thought, Should we do that?”\n\nCrowley and his team kept their eye on their North Star and avoided deviating down that and any number of other distracting paths. “You have to ask yourself, is what we’re supposed to be in ten years? Are these the products that we’re destined to create ten years from now? You have to have a clear opinion of what you’re doing or what you’re not doing. You have to trust your gut sometimes and say, ‘This keeps us on the path more than this would.’”\n\nStaying on the right path is not simply about making major decisions thoughtfully; it’s not a once-a-year agenda item for the company offsite. “It’s a series of decisions that get made every day,” says Crowley. “That’s because new factors in the form of data, market shifts, competitors, advisors—you name it—change the set of information you use to make decisions at any one point in time. The only way to keep focus is to continue to ask yourself: what’s this supposed to be when it grows up? You’ll either explain or rationalize your answer. That’ll help guide you.”\n\nUp until 2013, for example, Foursquare gave its API away for free, even to the Fortune 500 companies who were using it—then an investor pointed out that that was crazy. “We thought people would switch to something else if we charged for it. It turns out when we started calling up the companies that were using the API most aggressively, they said, ‘Of course we’re going to pay for this. We’re actually wondering why you didn’t call us six months ago asking to be paid.’”\n\nThe team put together the requisite pricing plans and sales strategies and began selling their API. And in so doing, their eyes were opened to a world of new data products they could develop. In fact, in recent years, Foursquare has dedicated growing resources to enterprise sales of those products.\n\nBut how can you tell the difference between a distraction from your mission and a pivot that will enhance it? It all comes back to the crucial guidance of that North Star. “We always said, ‘Build the stuff that makes the real world easier to use,’” says Crowley. “If you’ve chosen the right mission—if, crucially, it’s something that excites you—your own reaction to new ideas will be telling.”\n\nAdmittedly, these were tough decisions for Crowley back then. The signals in the industry told him Foursquare should be big and be competitive. Almost weekly, he had conversations like this:\n\nCrowley: “I’m the founder and I don’t want to do that.”\n\nSomeone else: “But, that’s what everyone else is doing.”\n\nCrowley: “I don’t care. I don’t want to do that.”\n\nIn hindsight, Crowley can laugh about it and say it was such an easy decision. But it wasn’t. It was taxing.\n\nThere will always be distractions, big and small. As a founder, your responsibility is to stay mission-focused. “I think about those early Facebook stories. They had so much success, and so many distractions—Yahoo! trying to buy them for a billion dollars. The response from Mark Zuckerberg from that time is something like, ‘I don’t think I’m ever going to have an idea this good again.’ That, I think, sums it up.”\n\nTenacity as grit\n\nIt’s unlikely that bringing your big idea to the world will happen overnight, and having a mission you believe in will only become more important when you hit the inevitable slogs. Reflecting on his own decade-long journey, Crowley identified a few key principles that will help founders endure for the long haul:\n\nDon’t wait for someone else to build it. A lot of startups begin with a good idea that no one else has run with yet. That kind of initiative should remain a part of your company’s DNA, long after your seed round recedes into company history. And don’t be afraid to punch above your weight.\n\nFor years, Crowley had imagined technology that would know where a user had been without being told. Once someone delivered that, he thought, he’d make even better, smarter services. Until that day, Foursquare’s app would just use manual check-ins as a workaround.\n\n“In 2011, we were waiting for other companies, Google and Apple, to build that technology. It would be able to tell you, the developer, or tell your app where it was, which store or restaurant it was in. I thought that was going to be baked into the iPhone 4S with iOS 5. Those were the signals that we were getting from Apple with all the geo-fencing that they were launching,” says Crowley. “I remember we watched the keynote. We got the phone and we played with it. And we said, ‘this doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do.’”\n\nThat moment was an epiphany for Crowley: You can’t wait for another company to make the technology you need to build what you’re destined to build. You must develop it yourself.\n\nFrom that day, Crowley and his team set about learning how to develop the platform they needed to move forward on their revenue-generating plans. It took years. “There were moments when our board would say, ‘this thing doesn’t work. Is it ever going to work? We invested a lot of money into getting this thing working. When will it work?’ And the answer was: ‘I don’t know.’ It was a harder problem than anyone thought it was. It required more engineers and data scientists, which we didn’t have before. There was nothing for us to copy. We were building it from scratch.”\n\nWhat he didn’t tell the board was that he wasn’t always sure it was ever going to work. “You know what the end goal is. You know the stakes are high, and that there’s good reward for doing it,” says Crowley. “That’s the thing that keeps you doing it.”\n\n But that’s the thing about tenacity: sometimes you have to make the big bet, say it out loud, then throw yourself in so there’s no going back.  \n\nFoursquare’s technology embodies tenacity, even down to the name. The company called its location technology Pilgrim, to represent how important—nearly sacred—this mission was for the company, and how persistent it must be in its journey toward it. “When we announced Pilgrim, I took a look back at all we accomplished. Personally it had been eight years working on Foursquare and more than a dozen immersed in location-based or contextual-aware services,” says Crowley. “That’s even before you get to the efforts of hundreds of people at Foursquare. But that’s what it takes to build something—like our Places API or Pilgrim SDK—that can help thousands of developers or marketers. Tenacity over time has an exponential—not a linear—impact. But it takes dedication.”\n\nTenacity as a culture\n\nAt the end of the day, tenacity needs to transcend the founder and become a core company value. Big ideas aren’t brought to fruition single-handedly. Just as you’ll devote your time to scaling operations, you need to scale tenacity, too.\n\nTalk about setbacks openly and honestly. Make it a habit to share the good and the bad. “It’s really hard, but you can create a cadence. At an All Hands or weekly check-in, show two slides every week. One slide is about what’s good, one slide is about what’s bad. Build this into your process,” says Crowley. “Whatever the format, the goal is simply to ensure that the people building and selling your products understand what’s going on with the company. Overemphasizing the positive becomes problematic. Some companies are just drinking their own Kool-Aid all the time. That’s not helpful for anyone. You have to have a regular dosage of good news and bad news for self-awareness.”\n\nSeed a culture of ingenuity. You developed your foundational idea with grit and focus. As you grow, you’ll need to elevate lofty thinking as a company value and reward those who practice it, and you’ll increase tenacity exponentially.\n\n“We have infused the company with that same shoot-for-the-moon spirit that started it. Now, a lot of the things that generate revenue for the company aren’t my ideas. Someone pitched an advertising product that was loosely tied to Pilgrim, something that would help advertisers measure ad effectiveness. Another said we could predict the number of iPhone 6s that’d be sold based on foot traffic data,” says Crowley. “Those were not my ideas. They’re crazy. ‘Has anyone ever done that?’ No. ‘Why don’t you go do it?’ All right. ‘What do you need?’ We’ll get a couple of people to go work on it. ‘Go do that and let me know how it works out.’ That turns into a huge part of what we’re doing.”\n\nHow, though, can you stay focused when lots of fresh minds are generating lots of fresh ideas? Ask yourself whether any new idea leverages your core idea. If it does, trust in it, even if it seems outlandish. That’s how you honor the spirit of risk-taking that got you to where you are, without getting distracted.\n\n If your core idea is your North Star, go ahead and build a constellation around it. Just avoid adding stars that’ll shine alone in another galaxy—they rarely get as bright. \n\nTenacity as a private truth\n\nCasual observers probably don’t know that the Foursquare team has been defining itself as a location intelligence company; indeed, many have kept judging the company by its consumer apps’ usage metrics. “These days, we all know that we are creating a location tech company, built on the amazing work we do on the consumer side. But plenty of people on the outside world are like, ‘I don’t use your app anymore, therefore your company must be failing,’” says Crowley. “Sometimes people tell me they don’t use the Foursquare app anymore and to that I say, ‘Hey not a problem—we have more than 50 million people around the world who do!’ I think there’s also a lot of people who touch Foursquare data everyday—through our partnerships with Snapchat, Uber, Twitter, or Apple Maps—without even knowing it. The company is performing well these days because of all the technology we’ve built on top of all the data we have.”\n\nAs a founder, you will likely find yourself, from time to time, sitting on business data or strategy that you can’t yet share. That’s not to say you shouldn’t speak up when you can. Foursquare, for example, has been engaged in a significant campaign to educate people outside the company about its current priorities. “In the first three or four years of a company, though, you’re not doing that,” says Crowley. “The press is telling your story, the users are telling your story. Maybe you get on stage at a conference occasionally and talk about the great stuff that you’re building.”\n\nThen there are the even more frustrating middle years. That’s when you’re likely to be building the bigger, better things that will allow you to scale. And if you’re like most companies, there are sure to be stretches when your killer new technology isn’t working the way you wanted—or is still just a glimmer in your eye.\n\nThat’s the moment, Crowley says, to double down and stay true to your big idea. You might not be sending out press releases, but there’s one audience you can and should be talking to: your team. “Answer every question that they might have about your product. Repeat what you’re doing every week at the company meeting. Remind each other. Explain how you define success, and reinforce that internally. The world might not need to understand what you’re up to yet, but they sure do.”\n\nTying it together\n\nTenacity has many manifestations for founders and their startups. At the beginning, it’s often deeply tied to identity. Giving up one’s idea feels like giving up on oneself. After hitting early milestones, tenacity is confidence. But it’s best tempered with humility, so as to avoid flying too high on early wins. As a company scales, tenacity is focus. There will be accompanying growing pains as customers sign up, headcount grows, and the market responds. Anchor and orient yourself by asking: what is this supposed to be when it grows up? When the going gets tough, tenacity is grit. Don’t look externally to others to build what you need—you’ll be waiting longer than you want. Do it yourself. Lastly, tenacity is culture and a private truth. Tenacity at scale will both involve and elude people. What guides the team isn’t always accurately reflected in the public’s perception. An informed, committed team around you is the best way to drown out the noise and to march toward achieving your biggest goals.\n\n“These different facets of tenacity are important insofar as invoking them keeps your legs moving and charging forward. Growing a company is an impossibly hard endeavor—many wouldn’t start if they knew just how difficult it is,” Crowley says. “But the early stories of most successful companies are often those in which no one thought it could be done. In fact, if you asked them, those founders probably didn’t know if they could do it either. But if you can get there—if you stick to what you set out to do—it can put you in an amazingly powerful and defensible position.”\n\nThis article was originally published on First Round Review, read the original article.",

          "description": "With a new chief of staff, Trump's refocusing on his top priority: making America afraid again.\n \nAs a businessman, Donald Trump didn’t really get rich because he was good at making deals. He got rich because he was good at branding himself.\n\nSo it shouldn’t be a surprise that after a rocky first six months in office, he’s jettisoning Reince Priebus, the chief of staff he initially accepted as the condition of a deal — his pact with the Republican Party, after winning the presidency, to work with the establishment rather than against it — and replacing him with a retired general who’s currently carrying out Trump’s immigration agenda.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who Trump announced in a Friday tweet would be his new chief of staff, is perfectly in line with the brand that first brought Trump to campaign success: the idea that the world is a terrifying place full of people (mostly foreigners) who want to undermine social order and the American way of life, and that the tough American men who stand up to them shouldn’t be too closely questioned about how they keep those threats at bay.\n\nThat brand has succeeded for Trump — it’s made the right people happy (his base and the cable news networks that generate endless debate over inflammatory remarks), it’s made the right people angry (Democrats and people who go on cable news networks), and if it’s terrified certain groups, they’ve been people who don’t seem to matter to Trump (immigrants and black Americans who vote for Democrats). \n\nThe appointment of Kelly — along with a speech Trump gave in Long Island on Friday afternoon that harkened back to the most chilling rhetoric of his campaign — is a sign that the Trump administration is rededicating itself to placing those ideas front and center. And it’s rhetoric that, even beyond the policy agenda it represents, invites violence into the crevices of American life. \n\nKelly represents Trumpism as its most authentic\n\nReince Priebus was doomed from the beginning. He was hired as the White House’s resident Republican insider — which is to say, from the perspective of Trumpworld, its resident outsider.\n\nPriebus’s notion of the White House was alien to Trump’s — he had quaint ideas about managing Trump’s time and working with factions of Congress to pass bills. But just as importantly, when he did the things Trump expected his top staffers to do — namely, go on television and defend the president’s agenda — he wasn’t a credible messenger. It was too obvious that he was the kind of person who thought that life had been basically okay before 2017, that Washington hadn’t abandoned Americans to the rampages of criminal gangs. \n\nTechnically, Priebus was fired after the project he’d been assigned — getting Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act — failed in the Senate. But really, he was fired because, whether he succeeded or not, he didn’t perform in a way Trump understood or respected.\n\nWhile Trump’s health care agenda has foundered — as has much of the rest of his platform — his immigration agenda has not. As he promised, federal immigration agents are “unshackled.” As he promised, immigrants are being treated more harshly upon being apprehended at the border. The wall is happening slowly (and really, everyone involved agrees it’s more of a fence) but it’s moving along.\n\nBut while it’s true that Trump is simply elevating the man who’s overseen the administration’s biggest substantive success so far — Kelly — the reality is substantially more complicated.\n\nKelly wasn’t the brains behind the Trump immigration agenda. Most of it was designed by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (before he became Attorney General and got shut out of Trump’s inner circle) and former Sessions staffers now highly placed in the White House, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut over the course of Kelly’s six months at the head of DHS, he became the face of the Trump immigration agenda. And to Trump, that’s even more important.\n\nIt’s not just that Kelly looked the part, or that his appearances on Sunday shows gave off the air of an upstanding military man who was a little uncomfortable doing a media appearance when there were wars to be fought. It’s the fact that Kelly spoke — and to all appearances believed — as if the Trump administration was a constant war against the forces of lawlessness and disorder. \n\nTo Chuck Todd, he called intelligence leaks “darn close to treason.” He warned Martha Raddatz that “you just have to be vigilant” about terrorism because “this is nonstop. They are out there trying to hurt us every day.” He told John Dickerson that he was kept awake at night and distracted four to five times a day by the threat of a terrorist attack “to knock down an airplane in flight.” \n\nTo Chris Wallace of Fox News, he justified the Trump administration’s travel ban by saying, “We have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the United States. Otherwise, we’re guessing. And this president and John Kelly doesn't want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the US population.”\n\nTrump, easily distracted, hadn’t often returned as president to the apocalyptic rhetoric of an America under siege that he used at the most important moments on the campaign trail. Kelly did.\n\nIn a speech at George Washington University in May — a mission statement about Kelly’s priorities as secretary, delivered to an audience of Washington elites — Kelly was shockingly martial. “Make no mistake — we are a nation under attack. We are under attack from criminals who think their greed justifies raping young girls at knifepoint, dealing poison to our youth, or killing just for fun.”\n\nIt wasn’t the Kelly that many had expected when he was nominated — the regional Latin America expert who hated politics and would think a wall was total bunk. It sounded, well, a lot like Donald Trump, at a time when Trump wasn’t spending much time sounding like his old self.\n\nNow, though, that passage from Kelly’s speech might sound familiar. It’s awfully close to the rhetoric Trump used on Friday, during a speech in Long Island that was ostensibly about MS-13 but really about how important it was for ICE to be rough on immigrant “criminals.” \n\nThe Long Island speech came on the heels of Trump’s defeat on health care in the Senate. It wasn’t the first time his administration had pivoted back to immigration in an attempt to move on from an embarrassing setback on something else. But it was notable in its total lack of restraint — its insistence on turning subtext into text. President Trump (and even, for the most part, candidate Trump during the general election) hadn’t explicitly endorsed physical violence. On Friday, he called on police officers to shove suspects into cars without protecting the suspects’ heads from the impact. \n\nIt was, at once, absolutely bone-chilling and inevitable. It was a return to form. But it was a return to a form that many hoped Trump would have retired, for good, once assuming office.\n\nTrumpism isn’t just an ideology, but the belief that talking about something makes it so\n\nTrump may like the idea of having “a general” in charge of his White House staff, but Trump isn’t handing the reins to Kelly any more than he handed them to Priebus. The loosest cannon in the administration, newly hired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, will report directly to Trump, not to the chief of staff.\n\nManaging isn’t how Trump believes things get done. He believes things get done by talking about them. Now that he’s president, his rhetoric of America under siege has a counterpart: that under Trump, as he said on Friday, America is being “liberated.”\n\nTo a certain extent, this requires exaggerating his accomplishments, ignoring his setbacks. Sometimes it means that an extremely moderate policy is treated as a huge repudiation of progressivism or Obama; the administration has happily trumpeted a few dozen miles of border fencing in a House bill as “money for the wall.” When that happens, Trumpism’s bark really is worse than its bite.\n\nBut here’s the thing. Trump isn’t entirely wrong that using the bully pulpit to broadcast his worldview makes it real. It creates a space for other people to enact Trumpism on Trump’s behalf, outside the diktats of policy — either for people to use it as an excuse for violence against others, or as something to avoid by changing their own behavior.\n\nIt is true that if you tell immigration officers that the handcuffs are off, and then let them do what they want, they’ll be more assertive and aggressive. It’s true that if you tell police officers that protesters are a threat to social order and you don’t care whether people get beaten up while being loaded into cars, some of those police officers will rough people up while loading them into cars.\n\nIt’s true that you can, at least temporarily, deter people from coming to the United States without papers if you make it clear they’ll be put in prison even if they seek asylum, or that parents might be tracked down and deported for sending for their children to join them. It’s true that you can stop people from asking for food stamps or taking their children to school if they’re afraid of deportation — or if they’re afraid of violence at the hands of your supporters.\n\nJohn Kelly is very good at telling people to be afraid — either of the government, or of the people the government is fighting. That’s not just Trump’s brand. It’s his theory of governance.",

          "description": "Only days after the end of Ramadan and just before the July Fourth holiday, thousands of people gathered at a Chicago convention center for the 54th annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America. Activists, scholars, religious leaders, booksellers, food vendors, and families of many backgrounds speaking many languages attended panels about topics as varied as religion, relationships, politics, cybersecurity and climate change. Despite their diverse backgrounds, many in attendance had two things in common: They were American, and they were Muslim.\n\nSpeaking at a panel on political views after the 2016 election, Besheer Mohamed, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, suggested that an upcoming report would put numbers to the diversity that could be observed at the conference. That survey, released Wednesday morning, is the third in a series of Pew surveys of Muslims in the U.S. taken over the past 10 years.8 It is also a window into the changing attitudes of American Muslims — who make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population9 — on issues such as politics and homosexuality.10\n\n“The key theme that we see regarding U.S. Muslims is diversity,” Mohamed told reporters on Tuesday, ahead of the report’s release. “Among immigrants, no single ethnic group has a majority. … Among U.S.-born Muslims, no racial group has a majority.”\n\nAmerican Muslims are also ideologically diverse. A plurality identify as moderate, with around 30 percent identifying as liberal and about 20 percent identifying as conservative. However, a large majority of Muslims in the U.S. prefer the Democratic Party, and that hasn’t changed since the 2007 Pew survey of Muslim Americans, the first in this series. In the 2016 presidential election, 78 percent of Muslim American voters said they voted for Hillary Clinton, which is a much lower share than the 92 percent who said they voted for Barack Obama in 2008.11\n\nU.S. Muslims tend to be moderate and prefer the Democrats\n\nShare of respondents by ideology and partisanship\n\nIDEOLOGY\n\nAMERICAN MUSLIM\n\nALL U.S.\n\nVery conservative\n\n7%\n\n–\n\n8%\n\n–\n\nConservative\n\n14\n\n–\n\n28\n\n–\n\nModerate\n\n39\n\n–\n\n32\n\n–\n\nLiberal\n\n20\n\n–\n\n19\n\n–\n\nVery liberal\n\n11\n\n–\n\n9\n\n–\n\nDon’t know/refused\n\n9\n\n–\n\n3\n\n–\n\nPARTISANSHIP\n\nRepublican/lean Republican\n\n13%\n\n–\n\n41%\n\n–\n\nIndependent/no lean\n\n20\n\n–\n\n9\n\n–\n\nDemocrat/lean Democrat\n\n66\n\n–\n\n50\n\n–\n\nSource: Pew research center, 2017\n\nThe Republican Party’s reputation among American Muslims seems to have deteriorated in recent years. According to the Pew survey, 59 percent of American Muslims believe the GOP is unfriendly toward Muslims; that’s an increase of more than 10 percentage points since 2011 — when Pew’s second survey in this series was done.12 Nearly three-quarters perceive President Trump to be unfriendly toward Muslim Americans, and 68 percent said he makes them feel worried.\n\nSurvey respondents also reported more discrimination. “The data suggests that the number of Muslims who say they’ve experienced a variety of kinds of discrimination is trending upward,” Gregory Smith, Pew’s associate director of research, said to reporters on Tuesday. Three in four said there is “a lot” of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S., and nearly half said they had experienced at least one instance of religious discrimination in the previous 12 months; that’s up from 43 percent in 2011 and 40 percent in 2007. Women said they experience discrimination more than men do.\n\n“It’s worth remembering that the challenges and obstacles that they tell us they face are really nothing new to the Muslim community,” Smith said. Despite concerns about discrimination, more Muslims in the 2017 survey than in the previous one said American people are generally friendly toward Muslim Americans.13 About half said someone had expressed support for them because of their faith, up 12 points from 2011 and 17 percentage points from 2007.\n\nAnother notable shift that the 2017 survey found was an increase in the share of American Muslims who say that homosexuality should be accepted by society, reflecting broader trends in the U.S. population as a whole. This change in attitude was present in almost every subgroup of American Muslims, not just the younger generation.\n\nAni Zonneveld told me that this finding doesn’t surprise her. She is the founder and president of Muslims for Progressive Values, a group that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex inclusion in the Muslim community. “We have seen the shift by way of affirmation of our position of LGBT+ rights from straight Muslims through social media,” Zonneveld said in an email. She said she has seen some mosques framing homosexuality as a human rights issue — but she also criticized Muslim institutions and policy organizations, saying that they haven’t gone far enough in advocacy for LGBT issues. In a July 5 news release, Muslims for Progressive Values said it was asked to dismantle its booth and leave the Islamic Society of North America’s convention because of its beliefs. The Islamic Society of North America declined to comment.\n\nIn addition to surveying the attitudes of American Muslims, Pew has asked the public about its perceptions of Islam and of Muslims. Although the new Pew report hints at the idea that the public’s view of Muslims in recent years has improved, Mohamed said that “about half of the public says Islam is not part of mainstream society, so we don’t see full acceptance of the Muslim community by the larger public.” He said Muslims continue to be rated more negatively by the larger public than Catholics, Jews, Hindus and many other religious groups are.14 Surveys have shown that most Americans don’t know a Muslim personally, but those who do speak with Muslims — even occasionally — report having more favorable views.\n\nMedia coverage might contribute to the perception problem. A recent study by Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that in reports with Muslim protagonists on three major national TV news networks, Muslim voices were rarely heard. It also found that news coverage about Muslims is often about terrorism and war. According to the Pew survey, 60 percent of American Muslims and 53 percent of the public agree that the media covers Islam and Muslims unfairly. Rayyan Najeeb, 26, who attended the Islamic Society of North America convention, said the media frequently failed to distinguish between the views of Muslims who live elsewhere in the world and the views of American Muslims. Najeeb said he appreciated that surveys like Pew’s give American Muslims the opportunity to speak for themselves: “It really counteracts a lot of the terrorist-next-door type of thinking … and a lot of the fear-mongering that has been happening in the news.”\n\nAnd publicizing those varying views helps remind people that American Muslims aren’t a monolithic group, said Meira Neggaz, executive director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a research organization that recently began polling American Muslims. “When you look at all these data points, I think it really highlights how people are just people, and it’s really difficult to lump everyone together and just say … ‘Muslims do this’ or ‘Muslims do that,’” Neggaz said. That’s why polls like Pew’s and ISPU’s are so important, she said: “The crux of polling is to amplify the voices of people. … They may not be doing a 10-minute interview on CNN, but this is at least amplifying the actual real lives of real people.”",

          "description": "There is something very wrong with the Republican Party right now.\n \nI honestly don’t know how to convey how appalling this process or legislation is. There is no analogue in modern politics.\n\nAt about 9:30 pm, Senate Republicans released text of the healthcare bill they intend to pass tomorrow morning. The bill would detonate individual insurance markets, sending premiums skyrocketing, and push 16 million people into the ranks of the uninsured. \n\nSenate Republicans know all this, and their answer is that they don’t want the bill they pass to actually become law. For many of them, the price of passage is a guarantee from House Republicans that they will not pass the Senate’s bill into law but will instead negotiate a new bill with the Senate that both chambers will then pass.\n\nLindsey Graham: Paul Ryan assured us \"under no circumstances they believe skinny repeal is good policy or good politics.\"\n— Paul McLeod (@pdmcleod) July 28, 2017\n\nThis raises an obvious question: If Senate Republicans want to ensure the bill they released tonight never becomes law and is replaced by a better bill instead, why don’t they kill the bill they released tonight and write and pass a better one instead?\n\nThere is no sensible answer to this question. Nothing that is happening tonight makes the slightest bit of sense. All of it violates every procedural principle and policy promise Republicans put forth in the aftermath of Obamacare’s passage. \n\nIt was Mitch McConnell who said, in 2009, that “if the people who wrote this bill were proud of it, they wouldn’t be forcing this vote in the dead of night.\" Obamacare didn’t pass in the dead of night, and the people who wrote it were proud of it — they held hearings, released bill text in advance of votes, waited for Congressional Budget Office scores, and defended it on the merits. But for all their complaints and exaggerations, McConnell and his colleagues never even accused Democrats of doing what they plan to do tomorrow morning — passing a bill so irresponsible that they required assurances it would never become law.\n\nBut to vote \"yes\" under these circumstances - dead of night vote for a bill with no scrutiny that nobody wants - is just disgraceful.\n— Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) July 28, 2017\n\nThere is no justification for this process or this policy, and so it has created a rare moment of consensus among outside observers of all political stripes. “I have never seen such unanimity in the horror everyone on all sides is expressing toward the Senate process on this health care bill,” wrote John Podhoretz, editor of the conservative journal Commentary. \n\nIt is worth dwelling for a moment on the environment in which this legislation lands. The Senate GOP’s bill was released mere hours after the White House’s new communications director told a New Yorker reporter that Steve Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, is “trying to suck [his] own cock” and Reince Priebus, President Trump chief of staff, is a “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic.” And all that came amidst Trump trying to push his attorney general into resigning by insulting him in public. \n\nIf this were a season of Veep, it would be panned for its absurdity and its crude caricature of Washington. But this is real life, and millions of people’s healthcare is on the line. \n\nWe are watching indefensible policy being pushed forward in an indefensible process in the hopes that it will eventually be signed into law and implemented by an indefensible administration. And what’s stranger is everyone involved knows it. All this comes mere days after Sen. John McCain received a standing ovation on the floor of the Senate for excoriating the way this effort, and the way his institution, was being run.\n\n\"We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition,” he said, before basking in thunderous applause. “I don't think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.”\n\nBut he has backed the process anyway, as have virtually all of his colleagues. \n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president, there was much talk about the ways in which he represented something abnormal and unnerving in American politics. But the congressional GOP’s healthcare process has been stark evidence that the rot goes far deeper than the White House. McConnell may present more conventionally than Trump does, but he is breaking norms, corroding institutions, and ignoring the consequences of his policies and actions with the same reckless abandon, and almost every Senate Republican is going along with it. Something is deeply wrong with the Republican Party right now, and the country is going to pay the price. ",

          "description": "The Senate failed to pass its Obamacare repeal bill early Friday morning after three Republican senators — Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), John McCain (R-AZ), and Susan Collins (R-ME) — voted against the effort.\n\nThis is the third day in a row that the Senate has voted down a health care bill. On Tuesday, the chamber rejected the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which would repeal and replace Obamacare. On Wednesday, it came down against the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, a straight repeal bill.\n\nAnd in a dramatic debate that began Thursday morning and stretched into Friday night, the chamber rejected the Health Care Freedom Act, a bill that whittled down the Republicans’ ambitions to repealing the individual mandate (which would still leave 16 million Americans without coverage).\n\nThree bills dead in one week now leaves the Senate with few, if any, options. The Republican caucus does not have any extra bill drafts floating around at this point. It only has options that it doesn’t like — and no clear sense of where to go next. \n\nThe HCFA wasn’t a bill that senators loved much from the start. Many senators were openly critical of the actual policy (which would spike premiums in the individual market) and tethered to their vote in favor of the bill to a promise that the House wouldn’t turn around and vote it into law. \n\nStill, through Thursday afternoon, the HCFA seemed to gather steam. A handful of senators, including McCain, liked the idea of using the bill to start a conference committee with the House and keep the debating moving forward. This group held a press conference late Thursday, saying they would support HCFA so long as the House guaranteed it would go to conference committee.\n\nThis was not a guarantee, however, the House could give. While House Majority Speaker Paul Ryan did put out a statement suggesting he’d be open to and even encourage a conference process, it wasn’t enough to win McCain over. \n\nAfter an hour of lobbying on the Senate floor — including discussions with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Mike Pence — McCain crossed the floor to huddle with Democrats. Sen. Diane Feinstein of California gave him a big hug.\n\nIt’s not clear where the Senate Republicans go from here, their repeal options currently exhausted. They have a caucus that strongly supports repealing and replacing Obamacare but little path left to get there. ",

          "description": "Dogs in Islam, as they are in Rabbinic Judaism, are conventionally thought of as ritually impure. This idea taps into a long tradition that considers even the mere sight of a dog during prayer to have the power to nullify a pious Muslim’s supplications. Similar to many other mistakenly viewed aspects of Islamic history, today both most Muslims and non-Muslims think that Islam and dogs don’t mix.\n\nThere is, however, quite a different unknown strand of thinking about dogs in Islam, a long history of positive interactions between Muslims and dogs that goes back to the religion’s very beginnings. According to several authoritative accounts of his life and teachings, Prophet Muhammad himself prayed in the presence of dogs. Many of his cousins and companions, the world’s first Muslims, raised young puppies. In the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina, the second holiest site in the world for Muslims after the Kaaba, dogs were regularly seen frolicking about during the prophet’s life and for centuries after as well.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the first Muslims had so many dogs. Most of them kept large flocks of sheep and goats, and dogs helped to manage and protect these other animals, preventing them from running away and scaring off would-be thieves and predators. Sheep and goats were these early Muslims’ food and capital, and dogs helped to protect these investments.\n\nCanines were also crucial companions during hunting expeditions. Long before Islam, dogs were depicted in stone carvings from ancient Egypt and Iraq running alongside their human owners. Muslims continued this use of dogs.\n\nAs Islam spread throughout the Middle East and the world, it moved from being a religion of nomadic peoples to one centered in cities. Many of the world’s largest cities in the millennium between 700 and 1700 were Muslim cities. As they did in the countryside, in cities too dogs played vital roles. They of course continued to protect property and shoo away intruders, but in cities dogs served an even more important function—they ate garbage. From Damascus and Baghdad to Cairo and Istanbul, urban authorities supported dog populations as consumers of waste to keep city streets clean. Muslim leaders built watering troughs for dogs, many mosques threw out food for them, and butchers used them to keep away rats and other vermin. Humans who committed violence against urban canines were often punished. Muslim cities were much cleaner and more pleasant places with dogs than without them.\n\nAll of this meant that Muslims throughout the world were in regular daily contact with the many dogs in their midst. They recognized how useful canines were as guards and cleaning agents and, we can only presume, developed quite intimate relationships with them built around regular contact and the kind of affection bred from codependence.\n\nGiven this history, where then did the idea that Islam is only hostile to dogs come from? The short answer is disease. About two hundred years ago, ideas about contagion began to change. Still very far from what we would today recognize as germ theory, people in the Middle East, Europe, and elsewhere started to notice a correlation between outbreaks of plague, cholera, and malaria and the physical proximity of victims to places like cemeteries, garbage heaps, and swampy lakes. City planners and governments throughout the Middle East therefore started to excise these sources of disease from the increasingly crowded districts in which their people lived. As they collected and then pushed garbage outside city walls, they also unwittingly removed the dogs that ate this trash. Dogs used to keep streets clean. Now humans did.\n\nThe historic connections between dogs and trash did not serve the animal well. Not only was there simply less garbage to eat in cities, but the garbage that did remain was now seen as a threat to public hygiene and soon too were its canine consumers. Indeed, in just a few decades in the early nineteenth century, dogs came to be seen as both economically useless and hazardous to public health. The results? Several large-scale dog eradication campaigns, far fewer dogs in Middle Eastern cities, and a change in attitude toward the animal. No longer useful and productive urban residents, dogs were now seen as dangerous, disease-ridden, and expendable.\n\nThis relatively recent sea change in Muslim attitudes towards dogs explains the dominant view of the animal today. While of course opinions vary and the elite in many Muslim countries keep dogs as status symbols, the majority of Muslims see dogs as dirty, impure, sometimes even evil. As with so much in the Islamic past today, the history of dogs is thus misunderstood by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Most don’t know and many would likely not be open to the idea that dogs were treasured by the Prophet and millions of Muslims after him.\n\nFor those of us—Muslims or otherwise—whose most regular interaction with a living nonhuman animal is with a dog, the story of dogs in Islam offers another lesson as well. Humans did not always keep dogs for affection, love, or cuteness. For most of history, they were not pets. They were laborers, economic necessities, hunters, and street cleaners. Apart from dogs that sniff drugs, aid the blind, or chase criminals, very few of us today experience dogs as anything other than that joy that licks our face in the morning. However, throughout history they’ve been much more. Knowing this past not only gives us a fuller picture of the most ubiquitous nonhuman animal we welcome in our midst, but it also helps us to understand how our histories with other animals have shaped our current world.\n\nAlan Mikhail, Professor of History at Yale University, is the author of The Animal in Ottoman Egypt and, most recently, Under Osman’s Tree: The Ottoman Empire, Egypt and Environmental History.\n\nThis post first appeared on OUPBlog.

          "description": "Even at a slender 65 pages, The Muslimah Sex Manual: A Halal Guide to Mind Blowing Sex packs comprehensiveness. A handbook for Muslim women seeking satisfying love lives, the book starts with the basics—lessons on kissing, sending dirty texts, and the importance of foreplay. After that come chapters on sex positions, shower sex, bondage, and masochism.\n\n“This is the best way to vary your sex life,” said the author, who writes under the pen name Umm Muladhat.\n\nThe Muslimah Sex Manual, independently published in mid-July, has been variously described as groundbreaking and a welcome step. It busts the myth, parading as an Islamic belief, that a pure Muslim cannot be dirty in bed, while giving candid advice. Embedded in it is the message that Muslim women should enjoy a fulfilling sex life.\n\n“You can be pure as snow and still be dirty in bed,” says the manual. “What is amusing (in a sad way) is that many younger Muslims think that the practicing, masjid going, hijab/niqab wearing sisters have dull sex lives and never venture outside of the vanilla.”\n\nGreetings sisters! A wonderful book! I'm thinking of buying one for my auntie Lillah. The Muslimah Sex Manual. http://pic.twitter.com/ITdhAC4XvA\n\n— Umm Ratwa (@ummratwa3) July 18, 2017\n\nIt was a newlywed friend who motivated Muladhat, a practicing Muslim, to write. The friend protested that although she knew how to have sex, she didn’t really know sex. She didn’t know what her husband liked. And, more importantly, she didn’t know what she liked.\n\nThat was the beginning of Muladhat’s impromptu workshops. Everything she had learnt over the course of her marriage, she taught her friend, “fervently hoping that it would help her in her marital life”. A month later, when they met again, her friend was beaming. Muladhat was told: “Please, write this down and share it with other Muslim girls. No one teaches this. We’re thrown into marriage and only know the fiqh (laws taught according to the Quran) and the biology.”\n\nSo that’s what she did.\n\nThe manual details myriad ways to engage a partner, and lists around 100 positions—cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, final furlong, Amazon, among them. “Some couples never move beyond missionary position. If that’s what you two enjoy, that’s perfectly fine! However, not every couple wants to stay vanilla every time.”\n\nAccording to Muladhat, halal sex has some key rules: avoid anal sex, penetrative sex during menstruation, and sex outside of marriage. Pornography too is forbidden—“porn is a lie,” she writes, “porn is one of the worst ways to learn about sex.”\n\nMe reading The Muslimah Sex Manual: A Halal Guide to Mind Blowing Sex on the night of my wedding http://pic.twitter.com/5Vqwonj1x3\n\n— squidward (@bitterbrowngirl) July 18, 2017\n\nMuladhat grew up in a practicing Muslim family but never was she taught to be guilty about sex. “It was never portrayed as something dirty, nor as something that I should feel ashamed about,” she said in an email interview with Scroll.in. “Islam does not criticize sex, see it as dirty, or drum guilt into women. I was taught that sex is something between a husband and wife. Outside of marriage, yes, a person should feel guilty about indulging in it. Inside of marriage, however, it is something to enjoy.”\n\nMuladhat and her husband too have experimented in the bedroom. “Alhamdulillah, my husband and I have always had good communication,” she said. Their go-to source for new ideas is Christian sex and intimacy books because, unlike mainstream guides, these do not include explicit images.\n\nSince the publication of The Muslimah Sex Manual, Muladhat has received a few angry comments. Critics, the few there are, say the book fetishises Muslim women and encourages promiscuity. Muladhat expected this, which is why she chose to publish under a nom de plume. “I didn’t want to become forever associated with the book such that if any future employer would Google my name, they would find this book. My husband is aware I’ve authored the book and has helped me revise it. My friends are not aware, and I intend to keep it this way.”\n\nThe next project\n\nThe few criticisms aside, the reaction to the book has been overwhelmingly positive. In an interview to The Guardian, Shaista Gohir, chairperson of the helpline Muslim Women’s Network (UK), said: “I’m all for women talking about sex. Why shouldn’t they? Talking about sex in Islam is not new, and past scholars highlighted the importance of sexual pleasure for women, which included advice for men to ensure this happens.”\n\nMuladhat told the Huffington Post that she received a letter from a Muslim leader who plans to distribute copies of her book to couples undergoing premarital counselling at his mosque. “He specifically mentioned that he had long felt the need for a book which would talk frankly about sex in marriage without either being so explicit that it bordered on the profane or so bland that it became useless. His only criticism was that he wanted to know why the book was focused only on Muslim women and not Muslim men.”\n\nMuladhat does not plan to disappoint. Her next project is a book aimed at men. “I think it’ll actually be easier than the Muslimah Manual as I have the added perspective of being a woman and thus knowing what my husband does that works. He’ll obviously play a bigger role in helping me write the book than he did in writing the current one.”\n\nThis post first appeared on Scroll.in. We welcome your comments at ideas.india@qz.com. ",

          "description": "Last year, US customs officers seized over $4 million worth of fake chairs. It was the first year that the agency had ever seized containers-full of such unauthorized reproductions, thanks in part to a novel new training that’s turning port inspectors into design connoisseurs.\n\nOver the past 18 months, a five-year-old consortium of furniture manufacturers and design firms called BeOriginal Americas has been training US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers to distinguish real Eames, Starck, and Mies van der Rohe designs from fakes, among others. It’s working: According to CBP’s Intellectual Property Rights Seizure Statistics report (pdf, p.5), in 2016, customs officials confiscated 42 shipments of unauthorized replicas worth an estimated $4.2 million. In the same report, the CBP claimed that their “furniture enforcement efforts have helped to protect over 8,000 American jobs” a figure calculated according to workforce data provided to them by US furniture manufacturers.\n\nBuyer beware. (Kartell, Herman Miller, Fritz Hansen, Knoll, Carl Hansen & Søn / Graphic by Quartz)\nBut they’re up against a vast knock-off industry. Labeled with nice-sounding terms like “reproduction,”replica,” or “homage,” many designer chairs in offices, hotel lobbies, airports, restaurants and even big furniture stores are actually unauthorized copies. And while a knock-off Eames or Barcelona chair might seem like a harmless, budget-friendly addition to your living room, these illegal knockoffs threaten the economy and the environment, and erode the very meaning of design.\n\nImitating Eames\n\nThe iconic Eames lounge chair is among the most copied pieces of furniture. Designed by husband-and-wife team Charles and Ray Eames for the luxury furniture market, the leather and bent plywood recliner has become symbolic of good design taste and affluence. The recliner was originally conceived as a napping-and-reading perch for Hollywood director Billy Wilder, who wanted a handsome English club chair with the feel of “warm, receptive look of a well-worn first baseman’s mitt.”\n\nToday, the Eames lounge is still assembled by hand in a Zeeland, Michigan factory following the same meticulous process that the Eameses took four years to perfect. The mid-century modern classic often appears on celebrity photographs, TV shows, magazine covers, and enshrined in MoMA’s permanent collection.\n\nIt was a sensation from the moment it was unveiled it on live television in 1956. But not everyone watching the Arlene Francis Home show could afford to shell out $310 (around $2,800 today). Inevitably, knockoffs surfaced in the market.\n\nBy 1962, imitations were so widespread the Eames took out a full page ad warning customers about fakes. The ad on the back cover of Arts and Architecture magazine instructed buyers to look for Herman Miller’s logo, the only authorized manufacturer of their chairs at the time. (Swiss manufacturer Vitra makes Eames furniture for the European and Middle Eastern market today.)\n\n“Beware of Imitations” Full page ad by the Eames Office for the back cover of Arts and Architecture magazine, 1962. (Eames Office/Herman Miller)\nToday, e-commerce has made the job of policing fakes much harder. A quick search online yields hundreds of options, from Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba and various online retailers around the world. Brick-and-mortar shop Manhattan Home Design in New York City touts knockoffs that, according to one sales rep, “match or exceed the licensed product,” and even offers an instructional video on how to judge a good knockoff from a bad one. As with fake Rolex watches, there’s deep connoisseurship in the fakes business. Manhattan Home Design did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n Steve Jobs and Bill Gates sitting on an #Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman while brainstorming the next big idea. #EamesLoungeChair #SteveJobs #BillGates #tbt\n\nA post shared by Charles & Ray Eames (@eamesoffice) on Jun 4, 2015 at 10:08am PDT\n\nIn the end, it all boils down to bargains. For just a fraction of the original Eames chair’s $5,000 price, customers can get the look. On Amazon, Eames knockoffs sell for as low as $749—that’s even cheaper than Vitra’s licensed 6-inch toy version of the Eames lounge and ottoman, which costs $795.\n\nProtecting precious designs\n\nProtecting intellectual property isn’t easy for furniture designers. For one thing, the bar is high: IP laws for furniture in the US don’t protect function, so designers have to prove a unique element in their design to qualify for a patent. Even if you get a patent, patent protections that apply in one region rarely apply elsewhere—not very useful in a global marketplace. Even members of the EU can’t agree on a standard duration on design patents.\n\nIn the US, the Eames lounge chair and other iconic designs are protected by what’s called “trade dress” rights. “Trade dress protects furniture designs that have come to be associated by consumers with a single source,” explains intellectual property attorney Michael J. McCue. The law protects the “commercial look” of well-known designs such as the Eames lounge chair or the Coca-Cola bottle for perpetuity, even when design patents have elapsed.\n\nFew companies are above copying another’s designs. In 2012, the upscale US furniture company Restoration Hardware, which has something of a reputation for borrowing designs, advertised a metal chair called the “Naval” chair, identical to Pennsylvania-based chair maker Emeco’s well-known “Navy” chair.\n\nA lightweight and virtually indestructible model made of recycled aluminum, Emeco’s chair was originally engineered for the US Navy during World War II. Later, the rugged chair (aka Emeco 1006) became a popular choice for police station interrogation rooms, prisons, and hospitals because of its reputation for toughness.\n\nEmeco’s 20-06 chair vs. IKEA’s Melltorp dining chair (Emeco / IKEA)\nIt takes 77 steps over 10 days to produce one Emeco Navy chair, with craftsmen moulding, welding and finishing it by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania. The result is a $455 chair with a lifetime warranty. Made in China, Restoration Hardware’s heavier version costs just $129.\n\n“The last thing I want to do is to spend our money in litigation,” says Emeco CEO Gregg Buchbinder. “But if you fail to react to something that grievous, you end up losing ownership within a short amount of time.”\n\nThat year, Buchbinder successfully sued to stop Restoration Hardware’s copies from spreading in the market. Last year, he also successfully sued to stop IKEA from mass producing copies of a Norman Foster-designed Emeco chair.\n\nNavy chair vs. Naval chair (Emeco / Restoration Hardware)\nWhat’s wrong with knockoffs?\n\nCompanies who rip off classics benefit because they can skip the years-long product development phase and often have an easier time selling their versions because consumers are already familiar with the look. Large furniture companies like Ikea and Restoration Hardware, which mail millions of catalogues each season, can also disseminate far more information about a design than the original creator, adds Buchbinder. “The average consumer would think that’s the original chair.”\n\nA little bit of copying can actually spur innovation, argue law professors Kal Raustiala and Christopher Jon Sprigman in the book Knockoff Economy. “Imitation only makes the fashion cycle run faster and forces the fashion industry to be ever more creative,” they write of clothes knock-offs. “When an original becomes a knockoff, it’s a signal to move on to the next big thing.” To appreciate the difference between an original and a knockoff is to understand the difference between design and style. \n\nOthers argue that knockoffs can serve the original designer. Through what’s called the “piracy paradox,” copycats often help spread a designer’s work and increase the demand for it.\n\nBut good furniture designers are interested in durability, not novelty.“Built to last,” “timeless” and “heirloom” are the trade’s virtues. Charles’s grandson Eames Demetrios says that arguing for authenticity is difficult in a time when most consumers have little experience of making products by hand. “Most people when they think of the word ‘copy,’ they think of dragging a file from one side of a [computer] desktop to another,” observes Demetrios. “That makes us hard to have a conversation because at some level we have this feeling that a copy is the same thing.”\n\nRichard Donges and Charles Eames at the Herman Miller factory. (Eames Office)\nThere are practical considerations too. Buying knockoffs also exposes consumers and companies to safety risks, warns Coleman Gutshall, Bernhardt Design’s director of global strategy and sourcing. Without a reputation to protect, counterfeiters can skirt product safety regulations or employ factories with questionable labor policies. Quantum, an ergonomic office chair sold by Office Depot that looks suspiciously like Herman Miller’s Aeron chair was found to have defective backrest bolts and caused back injuries.\n\nAeron chair look-a-like Quantum was recalled in 2009. (U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission)\nThe difference between design and style\n\n“Copying something without consideration of quality is now an epidemic,” once said architect Benjamin Cherner to Dwell. “The world has been flooded with ‘stage props’—items that resemble useful objects but have minimal functionality.”\n\nBuchbinder blames knock-off culture on a popular misconception of what “design” really means. “The design of the chair really starts with scientists, chemists and engineers working on the materials and the processes,” he explains. “There’s so much more to design other than the shape. I don’t think the average consumer understands that, they think they’re paying for the shape.”\n\nDesigner chairs are often advertised based on form, finish and material. But like all good design, furniture design is primarily concerned with looking for solutions for specific needs. Well-built office chairs, for instance, are engineered so they don’t tip over when the sitter leans back; the superdurable Navy chair emerged from the US military’s need for a deckchair that could “withstand water, salt air and sailors”; and the Eames lounge chair is obsessively designed for comfort. Knockoffs, while styled similarly, can fail to deliver solutions because counterfeiters are focused on mass producing and selling good-enough products cheaply and quickly. “In the end, a fake is designed for one thing: to be cheaper,” observes Demetrios.\n\nThere are indeed some very good knockoffs. But the energy spent aping another’s design would be better spent on creating an original design that responds to a new problem. Good design is never just about form. To appreciate the difference between an original and a knockoff is to understand the difference between design and style.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that the global counterfeit furniture industry had been estimated at $1.7 trillion. That figure is actually an outdated projection of the “economic and social impacts” of all counterfeit and pirated goods by 2015, according to the International Chamber of Commerce. It has been removed from the article, and the headline has been changed accordingly. ",

          "description": "Jamie Oliver has been known to do otherworldly things with chicken, given a few strident ingredients and enough time in a single pot. But this time, somehow, you have to do even less to get there.\n\nJamie Oliver’s Tender & Crisp Chicken Legs with Sweet Tomatoes & Basil\nby Genius Recipes\n\nThis summery chicken-tomato-mélange's miraculous qualities have all the hallmarks of a braise—the fall-apart tenderness and well-developed, concentrated sauce—without having to sear anything first or spatter your stovetop or do ... much at all.\n\nYou truly can throw everything into the pot in the time it takes the oven to heat, ripping the basil leaves caveman-style and chucking them in; chopping the stems imprecisely and cleaving through small tomatoes, then chucking them in, too. Oliver’s website in fact clocks this recipe at 1 hour 35 minutes, implying just 5 minutes of assembly, which is only exaggerating a little bit. Like in this instant dinner party pork shoulder ragu, there are very few ways to improve on the good work a moderate oven and time can do.\n\nSee? In this gif, it only takes like 9 seconds!\n\nQuick question: Did you catch that the basil stems go in, too? Have you ever seen a recipe that does this? (No really, please tell me.) The stems cook down just long enough to turn soft and almost meaty, so that all but the very woodiest ones are safe to add to the pot.\n\nOliver is also the king of glugs and handfuls, which can reasonably be unnerving for people who treasure the guidance of recipes, as we do. But in this instance, it’s altogether freeing. I haven’t needed to reference the actual recipe since the first time I made it. The simplicity of the technique—snuggle in pan, roast—is fairly un-stumpable, and will expand and contract to fit any size vessel you have. I like to make a lot at once, which means I’ve found the perfect use for extra-wide Dansk pan I inherited from my grandmother-in-law Virg (her pan is just like this round one, but in a deep coral/mauve).\n\nThe one thing you might feel torn about is running your oven for an hour and a half in the heat of tomato season—but as long as you’re not in one of the swampier corners of the country or world, it’s a very small price to pay. If you are, stay strong, and bookmark this for your first cool night, and all fall long.\n\nBecause as it roasts, the basil leaves turn crispy while the stems fuse into the sauce. Food52er nutcakes, who sent me this recipe years back, rightly called it “stunningly fragrant.” The chicken jus intensifies and swirls together with the slumpy tomatoes and whatever other friends you’ve thrown in with them. Cannellini beans? Baby potatoes? Collard greens? Just think: What would taste better in chicken-tomato-basil-schmaltzy-stew? Pretty much anything, right?\n\nJamie Oliver’s Tender & Crisp Chicken Legs with Sweet Tomatoes & Basil\n\nBy Genius Recipes\n\n4\nhigher-welfare chicken leg quarters\n\nSea salt & freshly ground black pepper\n\n1\nbig bunch fresh basil, leaves picked, stalks finely chopped\n\n2\nbig handfuls red and yellow cherry tomatoes and ripe plum or beefsteak tomatoes, cherry tomatoes halved, plum tomatoes quartered\n\n1\nwhole bulb garlic, broken into cloves\n\n1\nfresh red chile, finely chopped, or a big pinch of dried chile flakes\n\nOlive oil\n\nOne\n14.5-ounce/410 g can cannelini beans, drained and rinsed (optional)\n\n2\nhandfuls new potatoes, scrubbed (optional)\n\nView Full Recipe\n\nPhotos by Julia Gartland\n\nGot a genius recipe to share—from a classic cookbook, an online source, or anywhere, really?

However, there have been a few nice changes recently that open an incredible sweet spot.\n\nLast year, American Airlines changed its domestic first-class coding from F (first class) to J (business class). This changed nothing for AAdvantage awards, but this change halved the price of American Airlines-operated flights when using Avios. Last week, American Express improved the standard transfer rate from Membership Rewards to Avios to 1:1. If that wasn’t good enough, Amex and BA just launched a 40% transfer bonus.\n\nNow, you’ll get 75% more Avios when transferring Membership Rewards than you would if you transferred them a week ago, and American Airlines domestic first-class flights are 50% less than a year ago. That means your Membership Rewards take you 3.5x further on AA domestic first-class flights than just nine months ago! The same sub-1,151 mile nonstop domestic first-class flight that would’ve required 37,500 Membership Rewards a year ago now costs just 10,750 points today — that means you can book several round-trips with the sign-up bonuses available with The Platinum Card from American Express or The Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN.\n\nHow about celebrating by flying in a lie-flat business-class product? While American has a frustratingly inconsistent fleet, it also has some of the best business-class seats in the skies on some aircraft. And, some of these are flown domestically on a somewhat consistent schedule. Now, with the transfer bonus running through September 17, you can try out one of these products for just 15,000 Avios — which you can get for just 10,750 transferred Membership Rewards (as transfers must be in increments of 250 points).\n\nLet’s take a look at the routes you can do this on.\n\nIn This Post\n\nBoeing 777-200\n\nKatie and I enjoying dinner on a flight from DFW to MIA on the 777-200.\nAmerican Airlines’ 777-200 is so complicated that it takes an entire article to explain it. However, there are essentially just two business-class seat options. Both are lie-flat, but one is significantly more spacious and stable than the other. However, either one would be a huge improvement from standard domestic first-class products you’d find on other AAircraft.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nFlight #\n\nDepart\n\nArrival\n\nStarting\n\nEnding\n\nFrequ\n\nency\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n17:00\n\n20:55\n\nnow\n\nAug-3\n\nDaily\n\nMIA\n\nDFW\n\n61\n\n9:10\n\n11:11\n\nnow\n\nAug-21\n\nDaily\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n17:00\n\n20:56\n\nAug-4\n\nAug-21\n\nDaily\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n2307\n\n10:25\n\n14:10\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-22\n\nOne-Off\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n16:55\n\n20:43\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-31*\n\nDaily\n\nMIA\n\nDFW\n\n61\n\n9:10\n\n11:14\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-31*\n\nDaily\n\nJFK\n\nMIA\n\n235\n\n17:00\n\n20:12\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-22\n\nOne-Off\n\nDFW\n\nORD\n\n2332\n\n7:55\n\n10:11\n\nnow\n\nAug-20\n\nSunday\n\nORD\n\nDFW\n\n2334\n\n11:45\n\n13:59\n\nnow\n\nAug-20\n\nSunday\n\nDFW\n\nORD\n\n2400\n\n22:15\n\n0:27\n\nAug-3\n\nAug-3\n\nOne-Off\n\n*Likely extends beyond August 31.

The availability is helped by the sheer number of business-class seats on these aircraft (some have 45). Remember to use the best techniques when searching to save yourself time and hassle.\n\nHere’s one 777-200 flight from Dallas/Forth Worth (DFW) to Miami (MIA) with seven business-class award seats available. Even better, a hot dinner is served on this flight.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile it’s a lot more fun to fly these lie-flat business-class products overseas, it’s also nice to try them out on domestic routes. In addition to the extra space, I’ve found the catering to generally be better on these internationally configured aircraft. If you’re flying between one of the cities below, check to see if you can try out one of these aircraft for yourself using less than 11,000 Membership Rewards.\n",

          "description": "Access to the Temple Mount is a flashpoint. \n \nWas there ever a city of peace so prone to conflict? \n\nJerusalem, the spiritual center of the three monotheistic faiths, was rocked by protests on Friday over new Israeli security restrictions at a holy site sacred to both Jews and Muslims. The violence left at least two Palestinian men dead and more than 200 Palestinians injured in intense clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Five Israeli police officers were wounded, reportedly none of them critically. \n\nEven so, what was billed as a planned “Day of Rage” ended up being somewhat less violent than many feared it would be. \n\nThe heightened tensions began last Friday when three Arab citizens of Israel stormed the central area of Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif — the holiest site for both Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem, and the second-holiest place in Islam — killing two Israeli police officers. The assailants were shot on site. \n\nIn reaction to the terror attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government imposed unusually strict security measures on access to the Temple Mount and the area around the al-Aqsa Mosque, the golden-domed mosque often known as the “Dome of the Rock,” which sits at the center of the Temple Mount plaza. \n\nThose restrictions triggered further tensions across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as across the greater Middle East. Solidarity protests took place in Ankara, Turkey, as well as Amman, Jordan — and as far away as Yemen and Malaysia.\n\nThe size and number of protests were in no small part because Netanyahu’s security decisions challenged the very delicate status quo regarding Muslim control of, and access to, this holy site. \n\n“Bottom line is that Netanyahu and the government did two things wrong,” says Gershom Gorenberg, an Israeli historian and journalist who has written about the Temple Mount for many years. “They ignored that the conflict over holy site is a conflict over legitimacy and ownership” and that “you have to handle it delicately and behind the scenes.” \n\nBy acting unilaterally, Gorenberg explains, Netanyahu provoked a response that went beyond the immediate trigger, and stirred up long-simmering resentments over Israeli control of East Jerusalem specifically, and the West Bank more generally. \n\nHere’s what happened, and why this kind of violence keeps happening in Jerusalem over and over again. \n\nNetanyahu’s extreme security restrictions didn’t go over so well\n\nThough Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas was quick to condemn the murder of the two Israeli police officers, Israeli security forces acted quickly to shut down all access to the Temple Mount, imposing a two-day shutdown of all access to the holy site. \n\nWhen it reopened on Sunday, Palestinian men under the age of 50 were barred from prayers at the plaza surrounding the al-Aqsa Mosque. And then Israeli security officials went further, installing metal detectors at the perimeter. \n\nPalestinian leaders reacted swiftly with anger. Fatah, Abbas’s political party, called for protesters to demonstrate Friday in a massive “Day of Rage” protest. \n\nLeaders advised Muslim worshipers not to go through the metal detectors, but to pray outside of them instead, creating dramatic, massive scenes Friday of thousands of men bowed in prayer in the street. \n\n“We have been under occupation for 50 years and we will not get used to the new injustice,” longtime Palestinian Liberation Organization activist Mustafa Barghouti told the press on Monday. \n\nAP Photo/Mahmoud Illean\nPalestinians pray outside Jerusalem's Old City on Friday, July 21, 2017.\nAt the core of the issue is a fight over control of sacred religious sites\n\nPractical day-to-day control of, and access to, the specific holy sites of Jerusalem rests in the hands each religion’s own religious authorities, which means that when the Israeli government imposes security measures — even things like metal detectors that might seem relatively minor — without consulting with religious leaders, it can spark widespread resentment and anger.\n\nThe Muslim Waqf, the Islamic religious authority in Jerusalem, has officially controlled access to the Temple Mount through a status quo agreement in place since 1967, when Israel won control of the entire city from Jordan. That’s when access to and administration of holy sites were determined by delicate agreements with each religion. Those agreements are considered the status quo.\n\n“Determining when the status quo has been breached is tricky,” Ir Amim, a nongovernmental organization that focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Jerusalem, wrote Thursday in a post for Israel’s left-leaning 972 magazine, “particularly given that it is not written down and in light of the delicacy of how to develop an appropriate security response at times such as these.” \n\nBut optics matter. And the Waqf, Ir Amim explained, says that controlling entry is itself an essential piece of their status quo arrangement now in place for 50 years. “Installing metal detectors manned by Israeli security forces therefore unilaterally transfers authority from the Waqf and constitutes a change in the status quo,” the organization wrote. \n\nThe Temple Mount has seen violence many times\n\nThe Temple Mount has long been a flashpoint, and observers across the city, and around the world, have spent this week worried we could see a repeat of what happened 17 years ago. \n\nIn October 2000, then–Prime Minister Ariel Sharon famously walked on the Temple Mount, after warnings not to enter, stating his walk “was no provocation whatsoever.'' \n\n''It's our right,” Sharon said that day. “Arabs have the right to visit everywhere in the Land of Israel, and Jews have the right to visit every place in the Land of Israel.” His actions triggered the Palestinian popular uprising known as the second intifada, which lasted five years and killed more than 6,000 Palestinians and more than 1,000 Israelis, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization\n\nThis is the reason why, despite the three deaths and hundreds of injuries from Friday’s protests, observers are hoping that today’s violence marks the end, rather than the beginning, of a new flashpoint moment for the Holy City.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the tensions are gone. “[T]his remains an acute, unfolding crisis — and it is far from over,” explained a report posted as the day wound down by Terrestrial Jerusalem, a nongovernmental organization that addresses territorial issues in the city. \n\nPreventing the violence from escalating even further will require a great deal of leadership on all sides. Whether that leadership exists remains to be seen.",

          "description": "On Tuesday, the White Sox completed their latest trade, sending Todd Frazier, David Robertson, and Tommy Kahnle to New York for a trio of prospects and Tyler Clippard, who was included as a salary offset. In the span of four major trades, the team added 15 minor leaguers, including most of their best-ranked prospects now. And when you look at where these guys rank on the Baseball America mid-season Top 100, it’s easy to see why White Sox fans are excited about the organization’s now-bright future.\n\nCHW’s Recently Acquired Prospects\n\nBA Rank\n\nPre-Season Rank\n\nPlayer\n\nPosition\n\n1\n\n1\n\nYoan Moncada\n\n2B\n\n5\n\n11\n\nEloy Jimenez\n\nOF\n\n20\n\n24\n\nMichael Kopech\n\nSP\n\n36\n\n37\n\nBlake Rutherford\n\nOF\n\n59\n\n23\n\nReynaldo Lopez\n\nSP\n\n75\n\n40\n\nLucas Giolito\n\nSP\n\n83\n\n90\n\nDylan Cease\n\nSP\n\nThat’s seven Top 100 guys, and by BA’s pre-season rankings, seven top 40 guys. The Braves are the only other team to even put seven guys in the top 100, much less trading for seven top 100 guys in the span of eight months. And we’re not even including international signing Luis Robert, who BA ranked 45th. Throw him into the mix and the White Sox basically created an elite farm system from scratch in less than a year.\n\nRick Hahn deserves a lot of credit for the moves he’s made in rebuilding the White Sox, and the team certainly has a brighter future now than they did at the end of last year. That said, there’s also a pretty clear pattern emerging among the guys the White Sox have acquired; the perceived upside outstrips the actual performance record right now. Put simply, the White Sox have repeatedly bet on guys whose hype isn’t quite yet supported by actual performance.\n\nLet’s take a look at those same prospects again, only instead of looking at BA’s rankings, let’s look at how they rate by Chris Mitchell’s KATOH system, which is based solely on a player’s performance record. We’ll also include their KATOH+ ratings, which adds in BA’s rankings for an attempt at a holistic stats-and-scouting blend.\n\nKATOH’s View of New CHW Prospects\n\nPlayer\n\nKATOH\n\nKATOH Top 100\n\nKATOH+\n\nKATOH+ Top 100\n\nYoan Moncada\n\n8.6\n\n20\n\n15.6\n\n3\n\nEloy Jimenez\n\n4.7\n\n87\n\n11.5\n\n12\n\nMichael Kopech\n\n3.2\n\n5.1\n\n60\n\nLucas Giolito\n\n3.8\n\n4.3\n\n80\n\nDylan Cease\n\n2.2\n\n2.7\n\nBlake Rutherford\n\n1.0\n\n2.7\n\nReynaldo Lopez\n\n2.1\n\n2.6\n\nFor every one of the main pieces returned in the team’s four big trades, the stats-only version of KATOH is lower than the KATOH+ version, which incorporates BA’s rankings. And not in small ways. Based solely on their performance data to this point, Moncada and Jimenez project to produce about half of the value compared to when you include their BA rankings. And Rutherford stands out as the biggest outlier of all, ranking as a top-tier prospect in both the pre-season and mid-season BA lists, but grading out as a fringe prospect at best by his actual performance record to this point.\n\nOf course, stats-only models are ignoring hugely important factors in a player’s development, and no one should look at KATOH’s numbers and think those are the right ones. Performance record is important, but it’s definitely not everything, and you’re always better off including as much good information as you can, which is why KATOH+ will do a better job of projecting players than the stats-only model.\n\nBut it’s also not a coincidence that these were the guys who weren’t off limits in negotiations. While it’s not like the Red Sox were eager to give up Yoan Moncada, his performance — specifically his contact rate — raised some red flags, and made him a bit more of an offensive question mark that the usual type of players who are rated as the best overall prospect in the game. The upside is obvious, but as Chris Mitchell noted this morning, the bust potential here is also high enough that KATOH isn’t quite as high on him as everyone else.\n\nThe same is true of Jimenez and Rutherford, both of whom project as corner outfielders, and will have to hit really well to be legitimate stars in the big leagues. Jimenez is doing actual damage against low-minors pitchers, but Rutherford isn’t yet showing much power, and both of these guys are basically nothing if they don’t hit. And the history of guys who have to hit in order to be valuable big leaguers is strewn with top prospects who didn’t pan out. Again, plenty of risk here.\n\nThen there are the arms. Michael Kopech still has serious control problems. Reynoldo Lopez still doesn’t miss as many bats as you’d like from a guy with his stuff. Giolito has started getting strikeouts lately, but his walk rate is too high, and he’s still giving up home runs. Thanks to Tommy John surgery slowing down his career, Cease is still in low-A ball at 21, and like all these other guys, walks too many hitters right now.\n\nThese seven guys all have really impressive physical tools, but they also each have pretty significant flaws at the moment, most of them revolving around the strike zone. Certainly, these guys can improve from what they currently are, but part of the reason the White Sox were able to acquire all these guys is that their development is anything but guaranteed. Rick Hahn prioritized upside in his acquisitions, and while he’s done a great job picking up guys that have obviously high ceilings, we also shouldn’t be surprised when most of these guys don’t make it.\n\nObviously, there are risks with every prospect, and saying that a bunch of them are going to fail isn’t breaking news. But it’s notable that the White Sox have landed risky prospects even by prospect standards, and the performance records of the guys Hahn has been acquiring don’t yet match up with their prospect rankings. For these deals to work out as well as the White Sox hope, their player development system is going to have to take some raw materials and turn them into polished big leaguers.\n\nThe White Sox system is now very strong, and their future is bright. But it’s pretty clear that Hahn has targeted upside over performance in trades, and that means he’s had to accept a lot of risk to get these returns. Pretty soon, the White Sox might want to start adding some guys who have a bit lower ceilings but better chances of turning into Major Leaguers, because as this teardown shows, having a few stars surrounded by a bunch of busts doesn’t really equal a winner.",

          "description": "Another day, another wet blanket article talking trash about my truest love: Diet Coke. According to The Cut, my favorite non-alcoholic beverage (and #1 energy source) may be killing me softly:\n\nA recent study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that drinking one drink with artificial sugar a day can lead to a higher risk of weight gain, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\n\nAs someone who has been drinking Diet Coke since the mid-eighties, I do not find the above set of words to be extremely interesting. Also, I don’t think that’s exactly what the study is saying. In fact, the interpretation of the data printed in the actual study seems a bit wishy-washy:\n\nEvidence from RCTs does not clearly support the intended benefits of nonnutritive sweeteners for weight management, and observational data suggest that routine intake of nonnutritive sweeteners may be associated with increased BMI and cardiometabolic risk. Further research is needed to fully characterize the long-term risks and benefits of nonnutritive sweeteners.\n\nTo me “does not clearly support” means you don’t have a very strong case, but that’s not my point. I don’t think anyone is under the impression that diet soda is good for you, and drinkers of it certainly do not believe that it is a healthful beverage. Out of all the diet soda drinkers I know, a very small percentage of them drink diet soda because they think it will lead to weight loss. (EXHIBIT A: This not-at-all-scientific Twitter poll.)\n\nDiet Coke-heads drink Diet Coke because we freaking love it. (I also drink it because I come from a family of Diet Coke drinkers; I didn’t even taste a regular Coke until I was like, eight.) But Diet Coke is one beverage that people just love to hate. I have a lot of bad habits, but no other habit has been so zealously discouraged than my habit of enjoying an icy cold diet beverage. It’s telling that my two favorite bartenders, who have served me far more alcoholic beverages than non-alcoholic ones, have only ever threatened to cut me off once, and the threat was not over martinis or Campari, but that sweet silvery can of aspartame-packed nectar. I have had actual cocaine users finish telling me a story about how much cocaine they did over the weekend (the most boring of stories) and then launch into a lecture on how the Diet Coke I held in my little, chubby hand was going to kill me (the cocaine user is usually holding a pint glass of tequila or something to boot).\n\nHere’s a freaking #lifehack for you: Enjoy a vice or two. Sure you can try to prolong your life by cutting out gluten or drinking coffee (or not drinking coffee), but life shouldn’t be about denying yourself, and what’s the point of living if you do so without joy? Diet Coke infuses my day with joy (and just enough caffeine) and I don’t understand why so many people wish to rob me of my joy. (Again, don’t say it because they’re concerned with my health; if people were really concerned about my health they wouldn’t like shenanigans such as this on Instagram.)\n\nDo I get a headache if I drink more than four a day? Yes, but I get a tummy ache if I eat an entire box of Kraft macaroni, so I just consume less of those things. (Anything worth loving should also be able to hurt you a little—that’s my motto.) There isn’t a strong case for Diet Coke as a healthy choice, but the anti-diet soda study I mentioned at the beginning of this article wasn’t particularly compelling either. If you’re really concerned, I guess you can enjoy some La Croix—though I hear fizzy beverage naysayers are trying to take that away too—but please leave my Diet Coke alone.\n",

          "description": "Trump is uninformed, underprepared, and unclear — and this is is the result.\n\nThe blame in the Senate’s health care omnishambles is attaching to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and understandably so — he wrote the bill, he designed the process, he owns the result. But the absence of President Donald Trump from the story is, itself, an important part of the tale.\n\nFor better and for worse, policy leadership in the modern era tends to come from the White House. Take the Affordable Care Act. Though the bill was written in Congress, President Obama and his staff were involved at every step of its construction — they set the policy vision, used the technical resources of the executive branch to work through trade-offs, were deeply involved in the legislative process, and led the communications effort on the bill’s behalf.\n\nThe apex of this was the Blair House summit. As the bill was floundering, Obama invited congressional leadership from both parties to the Blair House to debate the legislation on live television for hours. Obama was trying to prove to congressional Democrats that they could win the argument on health care, that he could win the argument on health care, and that they should trust him and pass the bill. It really is worth watching a few minutes of Obama’s performance in this, and contrasting it with Trump’s role in the replacement effort:\n\nObama’s performance was effective because it was, to Democrats, persuasive. Obama knew the details of the legislation, he knew the issue, and he knew how Democrats thought — and so he made arguments they believed, and persuaded them that even if the Affordable Care Act was a dangerous vote to take, it was still a vote worth taking.\n\nWhat happened publicly at the Blair House happened privately every day. Obama and his team were constantly working to sell wavering Democrats on the bill, to persuade them that the trade-offs made were the right ones, to convince them this was a historic opportunity to achieve the Democratic Party’s 80-year dream of universal health care. It’s no accident that Obama’s health care address to a joint session of Congress ended by wrapping the bill in the legacy of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and framing it as the “great unfinished business of our society.”\n\nThe campaign worked. In the Senate, Democrats had 60 votes, they needed 60 votes, and they got 60 votes.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was a heavy lift, and there are many who deserve credit for its passage — notably Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. But I don’t know anyone involved in that effort who thinks it could’ve been done without Obama and his White House.\n\nThe GOP’s repeal-and-replace effort was also a heavy lift, and it’s been done without the productive involvement of Trump and his White House — in fact, Trump often made the process considerably harder.\n\nThe core problem is Trump has no idea what he’s talking about on health care and never bothered to learn. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” he famously, and absurdly, said. His inability to navigate its complexities meant he couldn’t make persuasive arguments on behalf of the bills he supported, and he routinely made statements that undercut the legislative process and forced Republicans to defend the indefensible.\n\nTrump’s post-election promise of “insurance for everybody” with “much lower deductibles” set up a standard Republicans had no intention of ever meeting but kept having to answer for. At his occasional meetings with wavering members of Congress, he’s made superficial political arguments to people who had deep policy concerns. The discussions left legislators feeling insulted and annoyed that the president hadn’t bothered to do the barest amount of homework.\n\nBecause Trump doesn’t understand the legislation or the trade-offs it made, he can’t make persuasive arguments on its behalf in public or private, and so he mostly doesn’t try. Trump and his team are not frequent presences in the public debate trying to sell the legislation they’re so keen to sign. That’s one reason the various bills routinely polled around 20 percent — without Trump using the bully pulpit to argue on behalf of the legislation, critics, terrible Congressional Budget Office reports, and news of congressional infighting filled the void.\n\nWhen Trump does weigh in, it’s often a disaster. Asked by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson how he responded to analyses showing the House health bill would hurt the people who voted for him, he replied, “Oh, I know,” and said the bill was “very preliminary.” Later, after holding a Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the passage of the House health bill, he called it “mean.” But he never articulated a standard for a bill that wouldn’t be mean, and he never came up with a policy that wouldn’t hurt his supporters.\n\nLater, during a particularly delicate moment in the Senate’s negotiations, he tweeted that Senate Republicans should perhaps abandon the current process and “immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!” This tweet of no confidence didn’t make McConnell’s job any easier. At another point, Trump suggested it would be fine if Republicans failed to pass anything at all.\n\nIn this context, Trump’s missive this morning is comical. No one has ever heard Trump discuss, with any specifics, how good the Senate health care bill is. No one believes he can, or that it would be a good idea if he tried.\n\nThe Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017\n\nIn a prescient post-election piece for the conservative Weekly Standard, Yuval Levin and Gerard Alexander worried that Trump’s disinterest in policy would lead to chaos in the legislative process:\n\nIn the absence of an opinionated final arbiter who could always be brought in, the policy process can easily become far less, rather than more, productive. If President Trump is indeed to remain above the details, and if the executive branch is unlikely to be able to compensate for his relative apathy or absence, congressional leaders may have to think very differently about their own role in the policy process. That might make for some opportunities, but only if members of Congress are prepared for what to many of them will be an unfamiliar and challenging task.\n\nMembers of Congress, we now see, were not prepared for that task. McConnell is a legislative tactician. He might be the guy you want to pass your health care bill. But he’s not the guy you want to write your health care bill, decide its contours, make its policy trade-offs, and argue its merits.\n\nBy making McConnell that guy through his own inattention and ignorance, Trump set up the process for failure. The result was legislation nobody liked, that nobody could defend, and that looks likely to fail. And failure is, it’s worth saying, a better outcome for the GOP and the country: The legislation is so poorly built, and sold on so many lies, that if it did pass, implementation would be a catastrophe.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump posed as a master dealmaker. But you can’t make a deal if you don’t understand what’s being discussed, what the various sides want, or what the trade-offs involved in different concessions would mean. And you really can’t make a deal if you don’t know what you want or why you want it. Preparation, information, and clarity matter in policymaking, and the widely acknowledged reality that Trump is completely underprepared, woefully uninformed, and personally confused mattered here.",

          "description": "Unintentional New Beginnings\n\nYes, the trade that brought LaVine to Chicago was lopsided, but the franchise’s rebuild isn’t hopeless\n(Getty Images/Ringer illustration)\nThis offseason, hours, podcasts, think pieces, and strong drinks have been devoted to figuring out how blockbuster acquisitions like Chris Paul and Paul George will fit in new roles next year. But what about the less-acclaimed pieces in these trades, the guys exchanged for the superstars? Can a highly paid role player offloaded as part of a “salary dump” ever blossom in a new situation? Or can someone on the cusp of 25 minutes a game fall out of the league? This week we’re looking at the prospects of those players, the Unintentional New Beginnings crew.\n\nOne calendar year was all it took for the Minnesota front office to change its mind on Zach LaVine. Legend (and, well, reporting) has it that during the 2016 NBA draft, the Timberwolves refused to entertain a trade for Jimmy Butler if it meant parting with their own 6-foot-5 shooting guard. But a few picks into the 2017 draft, Minnesota made nearly the exact deal it dismissed the year before. Twenty-two-year-old LaVine, along with Kris Dunn (who Chicago was hot on last go-round) and the seventh overall pick, was dealt to the Bulls for Butler and the rights to Chicago’s 16th pick.\n\nThe trade was a swindle, Tom Thibodeau’s first on the job since he was hired in April 2016 to be the coach and president of basketball operations. (After being fired by Chicago, no less.) Minnesota may have had the best draft night of anyone based on that acquisition alone, but on a micro level, the timing was incongruous. The front office took off LaVine’s “untouchable” tag after an undeniable breakout year.\n\nSelected 13th overall in 2014, LaVine improved in nearly every category during the 2016–17 season, his third, before tearing his left ACL in early February against the Pistons. In the 47 games before the injury, the Washington native averaged 18.9 points per game while sharing the ball with Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\n“Freak athlete” is an overused term in the NBA, but LaVine deserves the label. His leaping ability nabbed him a spot in the dunk contest as a rookie; his mastery of hovering through air like Dave Chappelle’s Prince won LaVine first place in back-to-back years. Entering his third season, LaVine stopped leaning solely on his vertical. The Wolves needed a perimeter threat, and their two-time dunk-contest champion wanted to become that shooter.\n\nEarly in the season, LaVine told a sideline reporter — to much skepticism, including my own — that in the 2017 All-Star weekend games, it was the 3-point contest he wanted to take part in, not the dunking. Then his identity as a shooter began to sprout. His 3-point accuracy didn’t improve that season from the previous, sloping slightly downward from 38.9 percent to 38.7 percent. But LaVine is forgiven the dip by virtue of his volume: He put up nearly twice as many perimeter attempts as he did the year before. He shot 6.6 per game in 2016–17, far and away the most on Minnesota’s roster.\n\nAnd did they need it. (A not-so-fun fact about the Timberwolves’ 3-point shooting: The second-through-fourth-best averages came from Brandon Rush, a not-yet-re-signed free agent, and the team’s two centers, Gorgui Dieng and Karl-Anthony Towns.) Minnesota shot the fewest deep attempts in the league, another reason why LaVine’s spark was so valuable.\n\nThibodeau told the Chicago Tribune after the trade that “the consistency in which [LaVine] shot the ball” was the area in which he grew the most. “Early on, he was more of a streaky shooter. … Once he settled into being a two guard — and there are times he can bring it up; he can handle that aspect of it — he shot it really well. And he can shoot it deep.”\n\nLaVine did excel more as an off-guard than when slotted at the point, but that limited his touches. Off the ball, he was at the mercy of being a third option to Towns and Wiggins. Playing alongside two Rookie of the Year pre-superstars opened the defense to LaVine, but it sometimes hindered him from doing more. Wiggins needs the ball in his hands to operate, and KAT, well, what offense wouldn’t feed him the rock as often as possible?\n\n“There’d be games where he’d be on fire,” Zach’s dad, Paul LaVine, told the Tribune, “and he thought he didn’t get enough plays. I’d tell him, ‘Those are the No. 1 and No. 2 guys.’ And he was like, ‘I get it. But I’m ready for more responsibility.’”\n\nThose shots will be LaVine’s to take in Chicago. He’ll join a rebuilding roster that will surely give him an elevated role, though how soon his knee will allow him to grace the court is less certain. LaVine told reporters at the ESPYs that his recovery was so ahead of schedule that he expects to be “ready for training camp.” Those close with the team estimate a return around the All-Star break, Zach Harper reported. That’s a five-month difference.\n\nLaVine should be prepared to wait. If any organization is willing to exercise patience with an explosive guard recovering from a knee injury, it’s the Bulls. Not only will a low-expectation season (read: tanking) do the young Bulls well, but the lingering ghost of Derrick Rose still haunts the franchise. Though it feels much longer (the Phil Jackson experience can warp time like that), it’s been only a season since Chicago parted ways with the former MVP.\n\nThe only semblance of that 2015–16 starting lineup now is restricted free agent Nikola Mirotic, attached to the Bulls by only a cap hold. The Rajon Rondo experiment lasted just one season, and only Dwyane Wade remains in Chicago as an established (albeit fading) name on the roster.\n\nFor Fred Hoiberg, who was hired from Iowa State two seasons ago, a group of moldable young guns could lead to his opus. The defense will almost certainly turn from top-10 to muck, all of its former esteem following Butler to Minnesota. Dunn is a solid defender with encouraging upside, but LaVine, who brought the Wolves their fourth-worst defensive rating when he was on the court, represents a more accurate picture of what the Bulls defense could look like this season. But the offense, especially without having to cater to superstars, could finally mimic the pace-and-space style Hoiberg orchestrated in college.\n\nLast season the Bulls offense was set up to crowd near the basket. Butler, Rondo, and Wade all shot better than their career averages from the perimeter, but lacked consistency and combined for fewer than eight attempts per game. Minnesota may have averaged the fewest 3-point tries over the season, but Chicago was the second-least engaged. And the Bulls had the worst effective field goal percentage (which scales to account for the worth of deep shots) of any team.\n\nThis season, with two of the top-three offensive options and Rondo gone, the offense can take on a different identity. It’s impossible to say whether it’s one that will drift to the perimeter, but there are some context clues. The Bulls drafted Lauri Markkanen, a 7-foot sharpshooter (yes, you read that right) with the seventh overall pick. They then promised Denzel Valentine, who was used mostly as an off-ball threat, a bigger playmaking role this season. (Valentine had a rough go from the 3-point line in his rookie season, but he called the team situation “sort of confusing with me just standing over in the corner sometimes just shooting,” which can be chalked up to poor spacing. During his senior year at Michigan State, Valentine shot 44.4 percent from deep.) But the most damning clue of the Bulls’ plan to overhaul its identity is LaVine, whom the team accepted as a new centerpiece for someone of Butler’s caliber.\n\nChicago’s offense could still struggle from the outside, and LaVine will likely be out until at least December. Mirotic (who averaged the most 3-point attempts last season) has yet to be re-signed, and Anthony Morrow (who shot the best from deep) is an unrestricted free agent. Still, without Butler, the Bulls have the opportunity to become something new: a perimeter team. It’s an identity that Chicago will need to take on convincingly to bounce back from the rebuild — kind of like an explosive shooting guard coming off an ACL injury.\n\nZach LaVine and the Bulls Could Be Great for Each Other was originally published in The Ringer on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

          "description": "And here’s what comes next.\n\nIn the introduction to his 1987 Cultural Literacy, E.D. Hirsch Jr. laments the loss of a shared American culture — a body of knowledge, from Shakespeare to the Bible, that united Americans.\n\nHe recalls his father’s propensity for quoting a particular truncated line from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar whenever encouraging his colleagues to act swiftly: “there is a tide [in the affairs of men / which taken at the flood leads to fortune].” His colleagues — educated men themselves, Hirsch implies — would understand the reference, and so cultural communication would function smoothly. This shared consciousness, he suggested 20 years ago, was on its way out.\n\nHirsch’s nostalgia may seem even more dated now than it did in 1987. The idea of a “canon” of a shared cultural shorthand has been challenged as outmoded and exclusionary, unfitting for a pluralist society. Likewise, among the “neoreactionaries” of the alt-right in particular, the shared shorthand of (white, Judeo-Christian) cultural literacy is symbolic of a disappearing, homogenous “West” to which we can and must return.\n\nThree decades later, in the fascinating, complex 2016 book The End of White Christian America, the Public Religion Research Institute’s founder and CEO Robert Jones traces the decline not merely of a demographic, but of the racial and religious contours of that very culture. Jones described the decline of \"a shared aesthetic, a historical framework, and a moral vocabulary … [a] lingua franca.”\n\nThough the book begins and ends with a mock eulogy for white Christian America (WCA), it’s not quite a eulogy, nor is it gleeful grave stomping. Rather, it is a sensitive, nuanced look at the decline of a world \"where few gave a second thought to saying ‘Merry Christmas!’ to strangers on the street ... a world of shared rhythms that punctuated the week: Wednesday spaghetti suppers and prayer meetings, invocations from local pastors under the Friday night lights at high school football games, and Sunday blue laws that shuttered Main Street for the Sabbath.”\n\nThe loss of these traditions reflects WCA’s demographic decline through the rise of a more ethnically and religiously diverse America. But it also indicates that we’ve lost a wider “shared” (if not universally) sense of cultural understanding in the public sphere: both on the smaller scale of the town hall on and on the large scale of the White House.\n\nJones traces WCA’s decline as a culturally powerful institution, however, not just as the result of demographic change but rather as the result of white Protestant churches failing to adapt to a multicultural, multiracial America. Jones casts his eye on a complacent mainline Protestant church that failed to hold on to the fervor of its members, and an evangelical church that sailed to the “moral majority” on issues of segregation and race.\n\nPRRI itself is known for its careful cultural analysis of everything from the United Methodist Building in Washington, DC, once a de facto monument to the mainline cause célèbre of Prohibition, to Macklemore’s celebration of “same love” at the Grammy Awards. Blending the kind of exhaustive data PRRI touts, Jones traces two intertwined cultural histories: that of mainline Protestantism — careful, ecumenical, less fervent in the culture wars — and its sometime rival evangelical Protestantism, whose fervent and uncompromising reactionary approach to hot-button political issues from segregation to LGBTQ issues was responsible for both its rise and, he says, its downfall.\n\nJones traces the history not just of evangelicals but also of mainline Protestantism\n\nAs Jones tells it, while mainline Protestants took a careful, interfaith approach to social issues, quietly emphasizing social justice on an institutional level, evangelical groups edged their way into public prominence by a more conservative approach to doctrine, a focus on salvation, and a patriotic Christianity deeply indebted to the idea that the United States should be an “explicitly Christian nation.”\n\nMainline Protestantism declined first, as it lost ground to secularism and to the evangelical right, which was quicker to raise the political pulse. But as the culture wars of the ’80s and ’90s gave way to certain permanent shifts in American culture — most religious Americans now support same-sex marriage, and among young evangelicals support is likewise increasing — evangelicals found themselves, too, at sea.\n\nBooks, articles, and think pieces about the “religious right” are thick on the ground. Yet Jones’s nuanced take is most fascinating when it deals not with the flashier evangelicals and their celebrity-studded megachurches, but with their narratively drabber cousins. Mainline Protestants, regardless of political affiliation, tend to fade into the background in discussions of religion in America. Still, Jones highlights their importance, not just in their own right — from the history of abolition to the temperance movement — but as a perpetual foil to evangelicals.\n\nIt would be easy for Jones to set up a neat dichotomy in which mainline Protestants are the “good guys” — focusing on social justice and inclusion even as their brethren in the South supported segregation. And it’s certainly true that he is unsparing when it comes to evangelicals’ uneasy historical alliance with racism. He reminds us that “articles in the leading evangelical magazine Christianity Today encouraged Christians to root out racism in their own lives, but also criticized integration. Separating people of different races through law was not portrayed as a moral evil — in fact, some argued that it was necessary to maintain peace in the South. One author declared that supporters of integration were espousing a kind of ‘Christian communism.’” (Christianity Today’s mainline counterpart, the Christian Century, meanwhile, named Martin Luther King Jr. an editor at large.)\n\nFor Jones, we are living in the twilight days of what was once known as white Christian America\n\nBut Jones recognizes, too, that mainline Protestantism largely squandered its enormous political, social, and financial advantage over its evangelical cousins to the South, inadvertently ceding its status as the mouthpiece of American Christendom. After all, he says, mainline Protestantism’s contributions to civil rights \"were ultimately more symbolic than revolutionary, and more focused on the press than grounded in the pews.\"\n\nOverall, the age gap reflects this disparity: According to PRRI’s research, almost seven in 10 seniors identify as white Christians, versus fewer than three in 10 young adults. The recent decline in (white) mainline numbers in particular is striking: from 24 percent of the population in 1988 to just 14 percent in 2012.\n\nJones’s interest in WCA is cultural, rather than theological, and at its most incisive when he’s chronicling the death of a certain identity: one far more tied into whiteness and the rote wishing of a “Merry Christmas” than any particular theological stance. (If anything, this is the book’s one weakness. Other than a brief mention of Walter Rauschenbusch's “social gospel,” very little of Jones’s approach to WCA investigates how differences in actual theology or the structure of worship services might reflect, or tie into, the cultural differences that separate mainline Protestants from evangelicals, and from everybody else.)\n\nHe’s incisive, too, when describing the cultural segregation still at play in America — quoting a PRRI survey that the core social networks of white Americans are 91 percent white and only 1 percent black. He’s likewise dubious about the possibility for remedying this, pointing out that \"America has virtually no large-scale, widely distributed civic institutions that are equipped to nurture strong relationships across racial divides.”\n\nIn such a paradigm, it’s easy to understand how, say, white evangelical Protestants can at once perceive themselves to be under attack and possess such strong institutional power within their own communities: both things, in a fragmented America, are possible. Jones even elicits sympathy for those evangelical Christians who, witnessing their gradual media irrelevance over culture-war battlegrounds like LGBTQ issues, do find themselves, like Hirsch, at a cultural sea, unable to navigate a society whose new shibboleths they do not know.\n\nYet Jones raises the possibility that Christianity can only function effectively as a religion in the absence of its dominance in culture, which is to say, as the underdog. Just as Southern evangelicals came to dominance as a response to the perceived diminishing of Christianity in the public sphere among the pluralistic tendencies of the 1950s, so too, Jones suggests, must any effective Christianity of today — one capable of firing up its members — respond against the dominant culture.\n\nHe cites several recent examples of thinkers who have advocated just that, from Rod Dreher’s “Benedict option” of focused seclusion to Baptist firebrand Russell Moore’s embrace of Christianity as counter-“cultural.” He writes, \"As Christianity seems increasingly strange, and even subversive, to our culture, we have the opportunity to reclaim the freakishness of the gospel, which is what gives it its power in the first place.”\n\nIt is that paradox that lies at the heart of The End of White Christian America, and in discussions of Christianity and public life more generally. How can a religion often defined as a religion of outsiders — one whose sacred texts embrace the overturning of the money changers in the Jerusalem temple and celebrate those who leave their families behind to follow a wandering preacher — ever function in a dominant paradigm without losing its distinctive character?\n\nIt is that question that Jones’s book leaves us wondering: whether the death of White Christian America, as a cultural construct, is a good thing for Christianity, the religion. For a religion that was once subversive, Jones hints, being countercultural may just be the ideal way to be.",

          "description": "The second season of Huang’s World, chef Eddie Huang's punchy man-on-the-street food and travel show that airs on Viceland, returned in late June. Its first episode, though, carried a heavier load than usual: wading through America’s troubled waters. In a segment following an Inauguration Day visit to Washington, D.C.’s oldest black-owned restaurant, Huang meets with Jared Taylor, founder of the “white advocacy” nonprofit American Renaissance, to discuss the ominous political climate over plates of, as Huang phrases it, “some fire peking duck skins.” Taylor, who considers himself an acolyte of “race realism,” is strong-armed in his frame of mind: in one exchange, he spews a theory about how there is a higher racial probability that you will become a criminal depending on the color of your skin. “The likelihood to commit crime has a clear genetic component to it,” he says venomously. Huang’s face goes blank; watching him, I felt the same mix of irritation and hopelessness his appearance belied. The first season of Huang’s World had visited Jamaica, run afoul of the law in Sicily; the host had confronted his own complicated heritage while visiting Taiwan. To be in his own nation’s capital, confronted with the contempt and hatred that had arguably birthed Trump, felt inescapably unjust.\n\nIt’s one of those moments that is hard to digest, but stimulating all the same—the kind of hallmark segment Viceland has become known for. Huang’s World is one 40-plus shows in a patchwork of scattered, rebellious programming featured on the Vice Media-owned network, which partnered with A&E and launched in February 2016. “We’re trying to make this organism that’s alive,” Spike Jonze, the veteran film and video director who served as Viceland’s founding creative director, said last year before its unveiling. Jonze said he wanted to mold a “channel that is personal, that is people trying to understand the world that we live in.”\n\nIn the 18 months since its initial broadcast, and true to Jonze’s original promise, Viceland has taken a no-holds-barred, documentarian approach to the bulk of its programming. A Season 2 episode of the Emmy-nominated docuseries Gaycation—wherein actress Ellen Page and her best friend Ian Daniel chronicle the pain and pluck of queer individuals—surveys Orlando in the aftermath of the June 2016 Pulse nightclub mass shooting, when a lone gunman fatally shot 49 people and wounded 58 on “Latin Night” (90% of the victims identified as Latino/a). Many of the episode’s moments are difficult to watch, and purposefully so. “These were humble people, just looking for a dream,” one man says of his two friends murdered that night, speaking to Page and Daniel, minutes before they attend their funeral. Later, the duo visit a memorial in which a mother tearfully remembers her daughter who was taken that night. “We have to take the message across the world,” she says. “We have to respect one another.”\n\nHow that respect plays out, though, isn’t always consistent; Viceland is often at its most fraught when it apes the voyeuristic tropes of other cable mainstays. One of the network’s more paradoxical shows is The Therapist—a face-to-face confab that, in certain regards, mirrors Intervention and Rehab with Dr. Drew—where Dr. Siri Sat Nam Singh unpacks the lived experiences of contemporary pop stars, and the habits that have bloomed as a result of years-long mental strains: alcoholism, drug use, depression. Freddie Gibbs opened up about the rape accusations he was charged with, while Katy Perry discussed being plagued by feelings of inauthenticity. The end result is something of an emotional tempest: therapy in the open can feel invasive and cruel, cheap even, but also important in its effort to destigmatize the toxic vocabulary that surrounds the practice, especially in communities where it is frowned upon (The upcoming season of HBO's Insecure in part tugs at the tension of Going To Therapy While Black). At times you want to empathize with the artist, but the thought that this was made for TV—and perhaps not as constructive as an actual, closed therapy session might be, without the spectacle of posture and performance—is never far from the registers of your mind.\n\nThematically, the channel’s collective landscape spans a handful of millennial-targeted provinces: comedy (Funny How?; Flophouse), weed (Bong Appetit; Weediquette), food (the Action Bronson-hosted Fuck, That’s Delicious!), fashion (States of Undress), feminist realities (Woman), modern finance (The Business of Life), and, among a dozen or so more categories, teen culture (American Boyband; Big Night Out). Many are good-humored and insightfully sharp, and burrow into important issues with humor rather than sobriety. In one of the soon-to-be-released, and rare, scripted series, James Van Der Beek stars as DJ and Major Lazer founder Diplo, in the cheekily titled, What Would Diplo Do? It’s a comedic gambit meant to poke fun at the artist, and also perhaps humanize him through a series of awkward encounters as he tours the globe.\n\nDesus & Mero, easily Viceland’s most beloved viral venture, is a current events late-night talk show hosted by Bronx-born Twitter heroes Desus Nice and The Kid Mero, who first became breakout talents with a series of podcasts. The show has hosted guests as varied as author and trans-rights activist Janet Mock, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, and MSNBC commentator Chris Hayes; New York adoringly described the duo’s sportive, free-form format as “more like a FaceTime conversation than highly produced cable TV.” Watching a recent episode that featured the multihyphenate entrepreneur and artist Diddy, the conversation swayed from honest and relatable to sneakily illuminating, all without trying to be more than it was. “They can see a story about black men and black women, and it don’t have to be a slave story, it don’t have to be about us being incarcerated,” Diddy said, commenting on his just-released documentary about Bad Boy Records, the label he founded. “We could have a story that ends happily even though there was some drama in between it.” But even for its successes, shows on Viceland have veered into offensive and distasteful territory, if not fully crossed the line. Its flagship music docuseries Noisey—which digs into the lives of on-the-rise black artists; it’s profiled people like Lil Yachty, YG, and Danny Brown—has courted controversy for its shallow, uniformed interview style, which, more frequently than not, verges on hipster anthropology and sensationalism.\n\nThe network’s short run has been an admirable push for greater sustainability and relevance, but a puzzling expedition at best. Jumping into a full-fledged daily programming feels curious for a company like Vice, which has long touted its own edginess by embracing counter cultures. It’s not that the shows aren’t innately enthralling—most are—it’s that the TV-streaming-social-media swamp into which they were born into fragments their importance and reach. There are limits to traditional television, after all. Where streaming hubs like Netflix and Hulu allow for a democratization of content—for a modest monthly fee, of course—Viceland caps its viewership by playing within the dated and often costly cable ecosystem. (A rotating cluster of free episodes are viewable on its website each week). Consider, too, that the way we consume TV has changed since nightly blocks had a chokehold on stations like NBC and ABC in the 1990s. Viewers are now loyal to particular shows, not whole networks. My favorites, for example—Blackish, Westworld, Power, Queen Sugar, Shameless, Atlanta, The Blacklist, Veep, and Transparent—span a carousel of networks and streaming platforms.\n\nWhat you’ve heard is true; we live in an era of Prestige TV. There are smart, incisive dramas and comedies and limited-series all around us, shows that, like Westworld and The Handmaid’s Tale, which garnered a combined 35 Emmy nominations last week, want viewers to marvel not just at the labyrinthine storylines, but at the caliber of acting and the heightened aesthetics. These shows intentionally don drag. They demand your attention. Viceland’s banquet of shows stands far outside this realm, and with good reason. On Huang’s World or Funny How?, there is no guise, no forced pantomime, however rotten the truth. What you see is what you get: real stories in real time. All of which is good and well, but with Viceland’s reported meager ratings, will any of it matter if no one is watching?\n",

          "description": "Few things scream summertime like cocktails al fresco. Even better: cocktails al fresco with a bird’s eye view of the people and city that surround you. From foosball tables and fire pits in Dallas to a lively mortuary in Denver, here are 10 of our favorite rooftop bars in America.\n\n1. Sugar — Miami\n\nGiven its subtropical climate, there’s never a bad time to enjoy a drink outdoors in Miami. But the experience is particularly sweet at Sugar, the garden-style hideaway that’s located on the 40th floor of the EAST, Miami Hotel at Brickell City Centre, which offers stunning views of Biscayne Bay. Owned by the Hong Kong-based Swire Properties, the hotel and its beloved rooftop bar pay tribute to the brand’s Asian roots with a unique menu of cocktails, including Lychee Blossom (made of vodka, sake and lychee) and A Night in Hong Kong (made of Absolut Elyx, Prosecco, jackfruit and lemon). A rotating lineup of both international and local DJs make Sugar the kind of place where you’ll want to plant and stay awhile.\n\nImage courtesy of Sugar.\n2. Frolik Kitchen + Cocktails — Seattle\n\nThough at first glance its vibe is sleek and sexy, with its LED-lit bar and glass-walled fireplace, Frolik, located on the fifth floor of Seattle’s Motif Hotel, has got a playful side, too — you’ll find ping pong tables and shuffleboard courts on the patio area. The drinks also put a fun twist on classic cocktails, like the Pear Ginger Mule (with Absolut pear, ginger liqueur, lemon and Nundaberg ginger beer) or the Orange You Old Fashioned (with Bulleit bourbon, bitters, Solerno blood orange liqueur and soda water).\n\nImage courtesy of Frolik Kitchen + Cocktails’ Facebook page.\n3. Gallow Green — New York City\n\nMake your way straight to the rooftop of Chelsea’s (non-hotel) McKittrick Hotel, home to the interactive theater experience known as Sleep No More, and you’ll swear that you’re not in Manhattan anymore. This is where you’ll find Gallow Green, a verdant rooftop bar and restaurant where twinkling fairy lights and greenery as far as the eye can see redefine the phrase “urban jungle.” Pledge your patronage by sipping on a signature Sleep No More, a Mezcal cocktail with pineapple bitters, coconut soda and lime — the perfect antidote to the dog days of summer in the city.\n\nImage courtesy of The McKittrick Hotel’s Facebook page.\n4. Bell Tower Bar — Santa Fe\n\nWhen you’re done browsing the markets and charming shops at Santa Fe Plaza — which has marked the city’s downtown area for more than 400 years — make your way up to the Bell Tower Bar at the luxurious La Fonda on the Plaza, the only hotel on the Plaza itself. Situated high above the city, there’s never a bad time to pop in for a drink at this bar which, as the name suggests, is located in a former belfry. But if you want to see something truly remarkable, grab a seat in the early evening so you can gaze out over the city’s adobe-style rooftops, take in the striking views of the Jemez Mountains and see one of the country’s most striking sunsets, all with a Bell Ringer — a spicy margarita made with fresh jalapeño — in your hand.\n\nImage courtesy of Bell Tower Bar.\n5. SODA Bar — Dallas\n\n“Fun” is the first word that comes to mind when describing a night at SODA Bar, the gem of a bar atop the hip NYLO Dallas South Side hotel. In addition to panoramic views of the Big D skyline, there’s plenty to keep any fun-loving reveler entertained in this retro-styled space, including an infinity pool, foosball tables, an outdoor fire pit and a cozy area that begs to be lounged in. The drinks, too, are nostalgic, like the Cedars Apple Pie (Stella Artois Cidre and cinnamon whiskey) and the Thin Mint (Jameson with Rumplemintz and Godiva White Chocolate liqueur).\n\nImage courtesy of NYLO Dallas South Side’s Facebook page.\n6. The J. Parker — Chicago\n\nThere’s a lot of competition for Chicago’s best rooftop bar; both Cindy’s and I|O Godfrey each have their own distinct charms. But we love The J. Parker, which sits atop Lincoln Park’s Hotel Lincoln, and not just because of its fabulous Windy City views, though it’s certainly got them. We also love that it’s an indoor-outdoor setup with plenty of seating (room for about 200 people altogether), and that its retractable roof makes it a year-round destination. But mostly we love that the bar endeavors to offer its patrons a trip around the world with a lineup of cocktails inspired by every corner of the globe, from Spain (the Vino del Sol is a vodka cocktail with pear liqueur, passionfruit, honeydew, triple sec and lemon) to the American South (the Southern Belle is a delicate blend of bourbon, black tea, peach and lemon).\n\nImage courtesy of The J. Parker’s Facebook page.\n7. Mama Shelter — Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles might be known as a place where its movers and shakers are always looking for the next big thing, but the rooftop bar at Mama Shelter — a Thierry Gaugain-designed boutique hotel in the heart of Hollywood — seems immune to passing trends. In fact, a single visit to the rooftop bar could let you set your sights on many of the city’s most iconic attractions, including the famed Hollywood sign. Yet there’s nothing pretentious or showy about the space; with its rainbow-colored décor and simple menu of comfort food staples like Mama’s meatballs, you may never want to leave. The space keeps its matriarchal theme going with its mom-meets-Hollywood-themed cocktail menu, which includes drinks like How I Met Your Mother (vodka, Aperol, red grapes, mint, lemon and wheat beer) and Throw Momma From the Train (gin, Aperol, lemon and Yellow Chartreuse).\n\nImage courtesy of Mama Shelter Los Angeles’ Facebook page.\n8. Linger — Denver\n\nGiven how lively Linger is, you’d probably never know it was once a mortuary — at least if it weren’t for the huge sign outside. That’s all just part of the fun at this popular rooftop spot in Denver’s LoHi neighborhood, which serves up a massive selection of wine, local craft beers and cocktails — some of which, like the Corpse Reviver (made with gin, ginger liqueur, Lillet Blanc, lemon, absinthe and activated charcoal) play up the venue’s dearly departed past. But the scene here is far from dead, especially during its weekend Beats & Brunch — trust us when we say you’ll want to make a reservation.\n\nImage courtesy of Linger’s Facebook page.\n9. Departure Restaurant & Lounge — Portland\n\nAsia meets the Pacific Northwest at Departure, a Pan-Asian bar set inside the 15th floor penthouse of Portland’s Nines hotel, which has been drawing throngs of patrons — both locals and visitors alike — for nearly a decade. While the outside patio area isn’t enormous, it’s worth waiting to nab a seat or squeezing into the crowd for the unrivaled views of Portland alone. In addition to a unique array of Asian-inspired handcrafted cocktails — we love the Seoul Spring, made with soju, bamboo syrup and lime — the bar is also home to the city’s largest selection of sake. Drink up!\n\nImage courtesy of Departure.\n10. Assembly — Philadelphia\n\nHigh above the Benjamin Franklin Parkway at the top of The Logan hotel sits one of Philadelphia’s most elegant lounges. Assembly, on the hotel’s ninth floor, delivers a sleek and sexy vibe in the City of Brotherly Love — and a menu to match. It wouldn’t be summer without a frosty glass of frosé, and Assembly serves up plenty of them. It also shakes up a mix of classic cocktails, like a Pimm’s Cup or Aperol Spritz, and turns summer’s favorite flavors into memorable libations, like the Basil Watermelon Lemon Drop. If you’re hungry, there’s an impressive menu of small plates, like Honduran Fire and Ice Lobster — Maine lobster prepared with coconut milk, fresh ginger, red jalapeño and fried plantains — and a tequila-lime cured salmon ceviche with smoked pineapple, red onion, cilantro and jalapeño. We’ll have one of each, please.\n\nImage courtesy of Assembly.\nWhat are some of your favorite bars in the US? Sound off, below.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of EAST, Miami’s Facebook page.\n",

          "description": "The City of Angels has always been pegged as a dream destination for world travelers. It was named the sixth-most instagrammed city in 2016 — an indicator of its 21st century popularity — and as a testament to its status as one of the world’s great cultural destinations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) just named Los Angeles as the host city of an upcoming Olympic Games.\n\nBut not everyone has the time — or the points and miles — to travel there, so if you haven’t yet planned your beach vacation or are waiting for the summer season to cool off before heading to Disneyland, we have some some amazing Instagram photographers to satiate your LA travel appetite.\n\n1. @nathanielwood\n\nPhotographer Nathaniel Wood has the inside scoop on what’s new and happening, inviting outsiders to take a look at the city through his lens with a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. His subjects? The quintessential LA trifecta: sun, celebrities and people who want to be celebrities.\n\n2. @killthecity\n\nNick Rufo, another Angeleno photographer, loves his city and wants others to see its beauty. His style — he shoots mainly landscapes and the occasional portrait — has drawn its fair share of fans and he’s amassed over 10,000 followers, with photos ranging from angelic blue skies and skyscrapers to portraits of up-and-coming rappers and skateboarders.\n\n3. @john.logic\n\nA 21-year-old SoCal native, John Logic has been taking photos for just over two years. He acknowledges that he isn’t the only photographer in the world, so he’s always finding ways to differentiate himself. Having always had a passion for art, he carefully chooses the time of day, weather and personality of each thing that he photographs. Seriously, it’s quite an amazing feat to make rush hour in downtown LA look like a hospitable place.\n\n4. @tiffanysbell\n\nFor Tiffany Bell, photography was just a minor interest in her life, but it eventually snowballed into a career. Through her work, she has taken photos of just about everything — from cities, humans, animals, nature and landscapes to interiors, exteriors, food and cocktails. She says photography taught her to “look at the ordinary and find the extraordinary” and it’s true — she’s managed to make gray skyscrapers and dark alleyways look like art in her shots.\n\n5. @laurenlemon\n\nHave you ever wanted to jump into a photo? That’s what LA photographer Lauren Lemon makes us want to do with her rainbow-colored Instagram feed. She uses her art to bring people together and has even promoted public art projects — like photographing a row of houses that had been painted pink due to an impending demolition.\n\n6. @dylan.schwartz\n\nDylan Schwartz is a creative director, photographer and director who has been named one of city’s best Instagrammers by Los Angeles Magazine and has worked with brands like Google, Austrian Airlines and Starwood hotels. That’s probably why his photos seem like they’re straight out of a movie; he’s gone to the extreme to get some of his shots, having flown in helicopters to get the perfect angle of the LA skyline.\n\n7. @dayzdandconfuzd\n\nDavid Ingraham’s first camera was a Kodak Pocket Instamatic. A professional musician by trade, he spends his free time with his current camera of choice: an iPhone. His black-and-white photographs of people walking through various LA neighborhoods make it feel like you’re stepping back in time, but don’t be fooled: his most recent ‘gram was taken this month.\n\n8. @lifeserial\n\nMatt Allard is a writer living in Los Angeles and in his free time, he likes to document his life through photos. In fact, he’s gotten so good at his craft that businesses have partnered with him for ad campaigns. His primary focus is lifestyle photography, and his love for food and coffee is evident in the well-documented café visits on his feed.\n\n9. @kimgenevieve\n\nOriginally from Canada, Kim Genevieve is a lifestyle and commercial photographer based in La La Land. Her unique aesthetic is comprised of bright color palettes and outdoor settings. It’s clear this transplant knows how to blend in with the locals — you’ll find beaches, colorful food and lots of palm trees populating her Instagram feed.\n\n10. @asteryx\n\nNot much is known about the man behind the photos other than the fact that they’re amazing and his name is Terry. His tool of choice for tackling aerial photo shoots are drones, but when he’s on the ground he’ll frame single subjects at the center of unique backdrops — like the urban light art exhibition located at LACMA.\n\n11. @danorst\n\nBy day, Dan Marker-Moore works as a freelancer in the motion graphics industry, doing design and animation, but when work ends, he polishes his skills in photography and videography. He’s captured beautifully composed images of L.A.’s sun-kissed skyline using drones and time-lapse photography to reveal the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n12. @maxwanger\n\nPer his bio, Max Wanger built his first camera out of paper at age seven, and his photography skills have only blossomed since. His feed consists of palm trees, sunlight and water sports — key LA icons. Pair that with adorable photographs of his children, and you’ll never want to scroll away.\n\nAre there any other LA-based photographers on Instagram that you love? Tell us about them, below.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of Paul Mounce/Corbis via Getty Images.\n",

          "description": "There’s still time to plan a trip to watch the rare solar eclipse, which will cut across the US on August 21. And if you want to experience it in some of the most beautiful spots in the country, you’re in luck: There are 20 national parks and nine national trails in the path of the totality.​ \n\nArtist and educator Tyler Nordgren, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Redlands in California​, saw an opportunity to use the National Parks to educate people about space science. \n\nAnd so he decided to put his artistic talent to use for the upcoming solar eclipse. His posters are inspired by the art used in midcentury Works Progress Administration materials. (Check out these WPA-style posters from the Department of Energy celebrating the US energy revolution.) And they’re pretty cool.\n\nTyler Nordgren\nTyler Nordgren\nTyler Nordgren\nNordgren first starting drawing professionally when he made the illustration for the cover of his book. He once teamed up with the NPS on a poster campaign to “See the Milky Way” where “Half the park is after dark” — a slogan he came up with on his own. \n\nYou can read his artist’s statement here. \n\nTyler Nordgren \nMost of the US will see a partial eclipse on August 21. If you want the full experience, you'll need to be within the 60-mile-wide path of the totality — when the sky goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Luckily, NASA has mapped out the best places to be for this sight in August.\n\nAs for Nordgren, he'll be watching the eclipse from right outside the main headquarters of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in Oregon. While the location will be great for viewing, Nordgren told me via email, the state has a lot to get ready for. \n\n“The state is very worried about the possibility of 100,000 people descending on that sparsely populated part of the state, getting in massive 8-hour long traffic jams, and having some newbie-camper in the forest accidentally starting a major forest fire that traps tens of thousands,” he writes. “So it could be great, or it could be a major apocalypse, in which case, maybe the ancients will have been right about eclipses all along. Fortunately, Oregon officials are hoping for the best but planning for the worst.”\n\nIf you’re not up for braving the eclipse-catching crowds in the path of the totality, you’ll still be able to catch a partial eclipse from anywhere in the US.

          "description": "Senate Republicans have fallen short in their first attempt to attract 50 votes for their health care bill. Small wonder. The Better Care Reconciliation Act, as it is called, is remarkable in many ways, but perhaps most remarkably of all, it fails to draw on a large body of constructive conservative ideas about what real health care reform should look like. As a result, it fails to fix the flaws of Obamacare that conservatives most often complain about.\n\nNow the Senate’s Republican leaders have a second chance. Instead of more secret meetings and backroom deals, they could use the extra two weeks they’ve given themselves in August to hold hearings on health care reform. If they did so, they would have a chance to hear day after day of testimony from conservative scholars and policymakers on serious proposals for improving the US health care system. Here are some key points that testimony would make, if it had a chance to be heard.\n\nSome of that testimony would focus on the top end of the spending curve. As the chart below shows, just 1 percent of the population accounts for 20 percent of all personal health care spending, and the top 5 percent of population for half of all spending. Many people in that range suffer from one or more chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney failure, or AIDS that require expensive treatment year after year. Their medical needs are literally uninsurable by traditional standards. They are not just at high risk of needing care; they are certain to need it. And even if an insurer could be persuaded to cover them, an actuarially fair premium would exceed the annual income of all but the very wealthiest among the chronically ill.\n\nPreserving coverage for people with preexisting conditions is popular among both liberal and conservative voters. A recent poll from Politico showed that only 42 percent of Republicans favored allowing states to opt out of a requirement to cover people with such conditions.\n\nConservatives policy experts have made some very reasonable proposals for dealing with those at the top of the cost curve. One of the most attractive is universal catastrophic coverage, or UCC for short. UCC would cover the top-of-the-curve health care needs of all Americans, subject to a deductible that limited out-of-pocket expenses to a substantial, but not impossibly high, percentage of their income.\n\nUniversal catastrophic coverage has an impeccable conservative pedigree. It was proposed back in the 1970s by Martin Feldstein, who would go on to serve as Ronald Reagan’s chief economic adviser. In 2004, Milton Friedman, then a fellow at the Hoover Institution, endorsed the concept. An up-to-date version, specifically designed to address the problems of the ACA, is outlined by Kip Hagopian and Dana Goldman in National Affairs.\n\nWhat a universal catastrophic coverage plan might look like\n\nThe exact parameters of the program would be subject to negotiation, of course, but let’s sketch some possibilities, for the sake of discussion. Suppose the deductible is set at 10 percent of the amount by which a household’s income exceeds the Medicaid eligibility level, now about $40,000 for a family of four. Under that formula, a middle-class family earning $85,000 a year would face a deductible of $4,500 per family member, with a cap of twice that amount for households of more than two people. By the same formula, the deductible for a household with $1 million of income would be $96,000.\n\nThe high-deductible policy might be provided directly by the government, as an extension of Medicare. Alternatively, following the Swiss example, people could choose among private insurers offering policies meeting the program’s standards. In that case, UCC would resemble an expanded version of Medicare Advantage — originally a Republican idea but one that now enjoys bipartisan support.\n\nPeople could choose among several ways to meet their out-of-pocket costs. As you can see from the examples above, for middle-class families, out-of-pocket costs would be comparable to those now faced under individual policies purchased on ACA exchanges, while for high-income families they would be substantially higher.\n\nOne option for meeting those costs would be to buy supplemental insurance to cover all or part of the UCC deductible. Such supplemental coverage would cost far less than policies now sold in the market for individual insurance, since the UCC deductible would set an automatic ceiling on claims for which the insurer would be responsible. Alternatively, consumers could pay out-of-pocket expenses from funds accumulated in a tax-deductible health savings account — yet another conservative idea, and one that is already on the books.\n\nVery likely, many middle-income families would decide simply to cover all of their routine health care costs out of pocket. After all, as the chart shows, the healthiest 50 percent of the population accounts for less than 3 percent of all personal health care spending, and the next 20 percent of the population for only another 7 percent of spending. People on the bottom half of the spending curve could reasonably pay their routine health care costs in cash, just as they now pay for oil changes or wiper blades for their cars. (After all, no one assumes that automobile insurance covers routine maintenance.)\n\nHow to remove one costly distorter of the health insurance market\n\nFiscal conservatives might, quite properly, ask how UCC could be financed. A large chunk of it could be paid for with another proposal favored by many on the political right — abolishing the tax deductibility of employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which currently costs the federal budget an estimated $235 billion per year. That oddity of the US health care system is a holdover from World War II, when employers lavished in-kind benefits on scarce workers to evade wartime wage controls. Both its liberal and conservative critics say it is long overdue for repeal.\n\nLiberals object to ESI because it’s inequitable. Suppose the cost of health insurance to your employer is $10,000 per employee. If that were taxed as ordinary income, you would pay more tax — but how much depends on your tax bracket. If your taxable income is $200,000 a year, putting you in the 33 percent bracket, the exclusion saves you $3,300 annually. At $35,000 a year, placing you the 15 percent bracket, the exclusion saves you just $1,500. The inequity is even greater for minimum wage workers.\n\nThat’s because higher-paid workers (or their unions) often negotiate compensation packages that take advantage of the tax deduction by slowing the growth of cash wages while increasing the share of health benefits. However, for workers who are already at the minimum wage, there is no room for negotiation. Wages for such workers cannot be cut (and they must rise when the legal minimum increases). As a result, the entire cost of employer-sponsored insurance falls on employers. That is one reason minimum wage jobs are less likely to include health benefits.\n\nConservatives have other objections. For one, ESI imposes disproportionately large administrative burdens on small businesses, which, unlike large corporations, cannot afford to self-insure. And ESI produces job lock. Workers who have jobs with good insurance fear to leave them for jobs elsewhere that would make better use of their skills but might not have the same health benefits. Quitting a job with ESI to work as an independent contractor or start a small business of one’s own is even riskier.\n\nThe BCRA, like the House bill, takes a baby step in the right direction by lifting the employer mandate that makes ESI compulsory for businesses with 50 or more workers. However, as long as the tax preference remains in place, workers and many employers still have an incentive to stick with ESI, shifting part of its cost to other taxpayers, low-wage workers, the self-employed, and would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd what about the poor? Liberal critics look at the way the BCRA slashes Medicaid and conclude that Republicans simply don’t care whether the poor have access to health care or not. Maybe that is true for some, but not all. Medicaid is simply not the only way to provide health care for people with low incomes.\n\nFor the poor, an alternative to Medicaid\n\nFor example, the Hagopian-Goldman variant of universal catastrophic coverage could be implemented in a way that would render Medicaid unnecessary. Suppose, as in our earlier example, the UCC deductible is set at 10 percent of the amount by which household income exceeds $40,000, roughly the Medicaid threshold for a family of four. The deductible for families below the threshold would therefore fall to zero. These families would get “first dollar” coverage from their UCC policy, so there would be no need for Medicaid as a separate program. (Such a scheme would also increase work incentives for low-income households, who would no longer have to worry that extra earnings would cause them to lose Medicaid benefits.)\n\nWe haven’t even touched yet on measures to control cost. As everyone knows, medical services, from cancer drugs to bags of saline solution to hospital stays, cost more in the United States than anywhere else. Conservative policy experts have many ideas for cutting costs without cutting quality of service.\n\n Had Mitch McConnell (R-KY) held hearings for the health care bill, he might have heard some fresh ideas from conservative health care experts. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nEncouraging greater price transparency is one such idea. As a report from the Commonwealth Fund demonstrates in detail, health care is unlike any other market. Patients rarely know what they'll pay for services until they've received them; health care providers bill different payers different prices for the same services; and privately insured patients pay more to subsidize the shortfalls left by uninsured patients. Prices for the same service vary widely, even though there is little evidence that higher prices are linked to higher quality. Already, some 30 states have policies to encourage more transparent pricing, although those policies are not uniformly effective. Recently, Reps. Michael Burgess (R-TX) and Gene Green (D-TX) introduced legislation at the federal level to promote greater price transparency.\n\nThere is some evidence that consumers have not always made use of health care price information even when it has been available. That is understandable at a time when most people received coverage through their employers that had only modest deductibles and copays. But it seems already to be changing as employers impose greater out-of-pocket costs on ESI beneficiaries. A system that introduced universal catastrophic coverage and replaced ESI with individual tax credits and health savings accounts would encourage greater use of comparative price information if it were available.\n\nTransparency is not the only cost-saving reform backed by conservatives. They also favor more competition among hospitals and physician groups, tort reform to control the high cost of malpractice insurance, the option for small businesses to form groups to buy health insurance, and more. Often conservative cost-cutting ideas are the same as those advanced by liberals. Last year, polar opposites Sens. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders co-sponsored a bill that would have allowed Americans to import cheaper drugs from Canada. Why were none of these ideas included in the BRCA, or even openly discussed as the bill was being formulated?\n\nNone of these reforms is a magic bullet. Even among conservatives, each has critics as well as supporters. Liberal reformers have ideas of their own that many people like even better, ranging from sweeping measures like Sanders’s Medicare-for-all to small tweaks in procedures for approving new drugs. Still, these are serious proposals with backing from reputable scholars and policymakers.\n\nThe scandal is that the secretive process by which the BCRA was drafted did not even consider them. Really, is it too harsh to say that the Better Care Reconciliation Act is not about better care at all?\n\nEd Dolan is a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center.\n\nThe Big Idea is Vox’s home for smart discussion of the most important issues and ideas in politics, science, and culture — typically by outside contributors.

          "description": "Two years ago, a young woman named Michele Hansen spotted a job opening that piqued her interest. She wasn’t qualified—the posting was for a product manager at an investment company, and she had no experience in financial services.\n\nIn that situation, the voice in your head screams for self-promotion. If you’re applying for a job, you know you need to bend over backward to hide your shortcomings. As an interviewer, when I ask candidates to name their biggest weaknesses, they usually respond with strengths in disguise. I work too hard. I’m too much of a perfectionist. I only won a silver medal in the Olympics.\n\nBut Michele Hansen did the exact opposite. She took a page out of George Costanza’s playbook on Seinfeld: “My name is George. I’m unemployed and I live with my parents.” Instead of trying to hide her limitations, she led with them:\n\n“I’m probably not the candidate you’ve been envisioning,” her cover letter began. “I don’t have a decade of experience as a Product Manager nor am I a Certified Financial Planner.”\n\nHansen got the job. And she isn’t alone. In one study, interviewers gave the highest ratings to business school applicants who were more concerned with being seen accurately than positively. In another study, Harvard researchers asked undergraduates to answer a job interview question about their weaknesses. Only 23% gave actual negative qualities: I procrastinate. I overreact to situations. The other 77% hid their weaknesses inside a humblebrag: I’m too nice. I’m too demanding when it comes to fairness. When collaborators reviewed the answers, they were 30% more interested in hiring the candidates who acknowledged a legitimate weakness.\n\nAlthough applicants believe self-promotion is the ticket to landing a coveted job, the evidence shows otherwise. Undergraduates who played up their skills and accomplishments were not significantly more likely to get job offers. Executives who tried to impress board members with their qualifications did not succeed in landing more board seats. And employees who went out of their way to highlight their successes had substantially lower salaries and promotion rates. Compared to flattery and favors, researchers James Westphal and Ithai Stern explain, “self-promotion is less consistently effective… it is less subtle and more transparent.”\n\nIn a pair of experiments, Alison Fragale and I found that self-promotion only paid off when the audience was distracted enough to remember the information but forget the source. Otherwise, they saw right through it: “If you were that great, you wouldn’t need to boast about your greatness.”\n\nOf course, you can’t get a job if you only focus on your inadequacies. After confessing her lack of relevant experience, Michele Hansen devoted the rest of her cover letter to explaining why she had the motivation and skills to succeed anyway. “I don’t wait for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what needs to be done,” she wrote. “I’m entrepreneurial, I get things done… I love breaking new ground and starting with a blank slate.”\n\nThere’s evidence for a backlash against female self-promoters. Trumpeting accomplishments violates gender stereotypes of women as communal rather than assertive and ambitious. (This helps explain Nate Silver’s finding that Hillary Clinton’s approval ratings go up every time she holds an office and down when she’s vying for one.) Michele Hansen overcame that backlash by establishing her deficiencies up front with candor and humility. As a result, her comments about her strengths came across as more credible.\n\nBy admitting your inadequacies, you show that you’re self-aware enough to know your areas for improvement—and secure enough to be open about them. That you’re interested in being hired for what you actually bring to the table, not what you pretend to bring.\n\nIn 1987, the Chicago Sun-Times had to replace their beloved advice columnist, Ann Landers. A young journalist, Jeff Zaslow, was writing an article about the search and decided to throw his hat in the ring. “How could you have the audacity to give advice?” an interviewer scoffed. “I may only be 28,” Zaslow replied, “but I have the wisdom of a 29-year old.”\n\nThey hired him.\n\nThis post originally appeared on LinkedIn.

          "description": "Stock Market Yields Are Higher Than You Think\n\nPosted July 4, 2017 by Ben Carlson\n\nCapital allocation is one of the most important decisions management has to make for corporations. Changes in regulations have made it more important over the years for investors to pay attention to not only dividend yields, but also share buybacks, debt repayment and M&A. This piece I wrote for Bloomberg goes over how things have changed in recent decades in capital allocation decisions and what it means for shareholder yields.\n\n*******\n\nOne of the reasons many investors are forecasting lower returns in the stock market is simply that dividend yields are much lower than they have been historically.\n\nThe expected returns formula for the stock market looks something like this:\n\nExpected Stock Market Returns = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth +/- Change in P/E Ratio\n\nEarnings growth and the change in price/earnings ratio are tough to pin down because one depends on how profitable corporations are in the future while the other boils down to how much investors are willing to pay for stocks at any given point in time. But the other component is very straightforward. Dividends yields are a known commodity.\n\nHere is the dividend yield on the S&P 500 going back to 1900:\n\n \n\nOver this period the average dividend yield was almost 4.2 percent. The current 2 percent yield pales in comparison.\n\nSo do these lower dividend yields mean lower future returns for stocks?\n\nNot necessarily. Investors need to look beyond simple income numbers when thinking about how much their stocks yield these days.\n\nThe reason stocks have gained so much during the current bull market has a lot to do with the lower yields. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. In the early 1980s, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted a new regulation that gave corporations incentives to repurchase their own shares. Before then, it was much easier for companies to simply distribute cash back to shareholders via dividends.\n\nThis has completely changed how chief executives allocate capital. The researchers Roger Ibbotson and Philip Straehl looked back at how this relationship has affected market yields. The following graph shows how share buybacks took off during the 1980s and now account for a larger proportion of overall yield than dividends:\n\nCombining the dividend yield and the buyback yield gives us total shareholder yield. And if you look at things from the latter’s perspective, today’s yields don’t look quite as poor as many investors assume:\n\nIbbotson and Straehl’s study only goes through 2014, but Howard Silverblatt from S&P Dow Jones Indices recently updated this data through the end of 2016:\n\n \n\nMuch like the performance of the market itself, the number of share buybacks is concentrated in the largest names in the index. Silverblatt noted in his report that the top 20 companies in terms of buybacks accounted for almost 50 percent of total expenditures. Aided by the huge buyback program from Apple, information technology as an industry has repurchased more than $622 billion in stock over the past five years, well over $220 billion more than the next highest spending sector, consumer discretionary.\n\nFrom the end of 2012 through the end of 2016, total dividends and share buybacks on the S&P 500 are up 42 percent and 35 percent, respectively. These numbers haven’t kept up with the almost 70 percent total return on the stock market in this time, but there are cash flows backing up this rally.\n\nInvestors have a strong attachment to dividends because that income in the form of cash flow can feel comforting when it shows up on a regular basis. But from a total return perspective, investors should be indifferent to the capital allocation decision between dividends and share buybacks. 2 In the grand scheme of things, buybacks and dividends are basically identical to the end investor. With dividends, investors are receiving their share of earnings from the company. With buybacks, they are also receiving their share of earnings from the company but it’s just coming from an increase in earnings per share.\n\nInvestors can create their own dividends by simply selling shares in stocks that have increased in value from higher earnings results.\n\nIn recent years there have been a lot of headlines about how share buybacks have been propping up the stock market. You never see the same headlines talk about how dividends are propping up the market, but they achieve the same result. Both dividends and share buybacks are indications that corporations are seeing an uptick in fundamentals through an increase in cash flows. While it’s true that dividends and buybacks are often funded through borrowed funds, the fact that the yield has remained relatively stable in a rising market environment means that there are positive fundamental underpinnings to this market rally.\n\nShareholder yields are higher than most investors appreciate but that doesn’t mean they can keep the market rising forever. In 2016, total outlays to dividends and buybacks declined by more than 2 percent. Investors could certainly decide they no longer wish to grant the market a premium P/E ratio if interest rates were to rise substantially or CEOs were to continue cutting back the amount of money they’re returning to shareholders.\n\nOriginally published on Bloomberg View in 2017.

          "description": "What Trump has wrought.\n\nAt the Washington Examiner, Byron York argues that those who fight Donald Trump on Donald Trump’s terms end up diminished. Trump sprays insults with abandon, mocking everything from his critics’ intelligence to their popularity to their ethics to their plastic surgery, but those who engage with the president of the United States on his own level make themselves look smaller and meaner, and they are never able to go as low for as long as Trump.\n\n“Of course one could say that Trump is at fault,” York writes. Yes, one could. York doesn’t so much reject that possibility as rule it out as a category error. Unlike most people, whose behavior is bounded by shame and thus amenable to criticism, Trump is truly shameless, and thus criticizing his behavior is useless. “Trump is Trump,” York writes. “He does what he does.”\n\nYork has a point. Trump takes such glee in conflict, and cares so little for standards of decency or compassion, that his assailants often diminish themselves by betraying their own values out of desperation. But this isn’t just true of Trump’s assailants. It is true of all of us. To consistently engage with Trump is to be diminished by him. And we have all been diminished by his presidency.\n\nWe are diminished when our president lies, and even more so when we begin taking his habitual lying for granted. The New York Times published a comprehensive list of falsehoods Trump told since taking office and found it wasn’t until March that Trump went a full day without saying something flatly untrue. The absence of public dishonesty, for Trump, is usually driven by an absence of opportunity to be publicly dishonest. “On days without an untrue statement, he is often absent from Twitter, vacationing at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, or busy golfing,” the Times found.\n\nWe are diminished when our president uses cyberbullying as a communications strategy, spending his mornings picking childish fights on Twitter and coming up with insulting nicknames for his enemies. It is impossible to imagine the firestorm that would have followed Barack Obama or Bill Clinton mocking a television anchor’s plastic surgery. But in this White House, press officers justify the president’s insults by saying he “fights fire with fire.” The president is teaching our children that bullies win so long as they never, ever back down.\n\nWe are diminished when our president spends his time and energy — and thus the nation’s time and energy — on the wrong issues. At Axios, Mike Allen notes Trump has tweeted the words “opioid” or “opioids” just once — but “loser” 234 times, and “dumb” or “dummy” 222 times. Political capital is finite, and our future is harmed when it is squandered.\n\nWe are diminished when the president knows nothing about the issues he faces, and does not try to learn more. It is embarrassing that the president’s staffers have taken to writing his name as often as possible in briefing documents for fear that he will lose interest otherwise, that they fill his press clips with sycophantic praise in an effort to distract him from Twitter, that they fight to appear on Fox & Friends because they know he takes advice from the television better than from his own advisers. We have a president who was not humble enough to realize health care and North Korea are complex problems, and who has not responded to that realization by seriously studying the issues.\n\nWe are diminished when our political leaders excuse or ignore behavior they know is wrong. On Face the Nation Sunday, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a conservative Republican who just wrote a book about the Founding Fathers, was asked to evaluate Trump’s behavior “based on your view of the standards the founders set for virtue.” Lee took a hard pass. “It's not going to do any good for me or anyone else to come in and just comment on things we might not like about his Twitter behavior,” he said.\n\nLee’s position has become standard fare for Republican politicians who are appalled by their president but wary of criticizing him daily. Thus, the party that tried to impeach Bill Clinton to protect family values has embraced the position that it does no good to publicly discuss the president’s routine violations of basic decency. Unable to defend the president’s behavior, Republicans have decided the only viable path forward is to declare him exempt from moral judgment.\n\nWe are diminished when the people who need America’s mercy and protection most are harmed in service of lies and bigotry. The refugees the president has sought to bar from our shores have never attacked this country, and are in desperate need of its help. The immigrants the president has called rapists and murders commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens — they are overwhelmingly here to feed their families, not terrorize anyone else’s. The men, women, and children who will lose health insurance under the legislation the president has endorsed are the same people he promised to help.\n\nWe are diminished when the rest of the world comes to doubt our leadership and reliability. A Pew poll of 37 countries ranging from Sweden to India to Brazil to Ghana shows attitudes toward the United States have collapsed since Trump took office. At the end of Obama’s presidency, 64 percent of people in these countries said they were confident in the US president. Today, that has fallen to 22 percent. Opinions of America overall have fallen by 15 points. The chancellor of Germany warned that Europe could no longer depend on the US.\n\nWe are diminished when our president has little respect for the institutions and norms that have protected our country. Trump has done his best to sow doubt about the legitimacy of America’s electoral system, of its civil servants, of its courts, and of its media. He has created an enemies list to explain away his failures and misdeeds — in his telling, he is beset by “so-called judges,” the deep state, illegal voters, and fake news.\n\nHe routinely praises authoritarian rulers abroad while dismissing and undermining democratic results at home. He fired the director of the FBI to squash a troublesome investigation and then bragged about it on television. His demands for loyalty pledges, and his resistance to the idea that political appointees serve the country rather than him, have rendered the US government untrustworthy.\n\nA list like this can go on. It is a measure of our diminishment how much is left off it — how many outrages and disappointments have already faded from memory. Six months into his term, Trump’s policy achievements are few and thin, but he has coarsened our politics, shown the power of shamelessness, undermined our faith in each other and ourselves, modeled behavior we would punish children for exhibiting, and implicated all of us in the running fiasco of his presidency. He has diminished the country he promised to make great.",

          "description": "In the past year, researchers Martha Ross and Natalie Holmes gave a handful of presentation to local officials about how to match up job seekers with employment.\n\nBut they realized there was a problem: It was incredibly difficult for people to form a mental model of what their out-of-work population looked like.\n\nAnd without having a way to think about this population, it was hard to devise programs to help people who were looking for work.\n\nThere were some frameworks that tried to group the out-of-work population into management bits and pieces. For examples, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2013 diagnosed 14 groups of people who have barriers to employment:\n\nBut this often meant local officials were creating hyper-specific programs, like for low-income moms with kids. This meant their programs often didn't fit the \"typology\" of many people in their out-of-work population.\n\nSo the researchers sought out something that could be \"grafted\" onto existing mental models so people could broaden the way they thought about this population, rather than looking at single defining characteristics.\n\nLet's find a way to cluster people\n\nThe first step for Ross and Holmes, both of the Brookings Institution, was figuring out who needs help finding work.\n\nIt wouldn't be sufficient to merely look at who officially qualifies as \"unemployed\" under the official measure, since it only counts people who looked for work in the past four weeks. So, on top of those people, they took everyone else ages 25 to 64 who isn't in the labor force, and subtracted out people who appeared to be in school, rearing a child, or retired.\n\nNow that they had an out-of-work population, they had to figure out how to group them. Here's where the magic happens:\n\nThey diagnosed a handful of characteristics that would shape the kind of workforce intervention someone might need — things like age, education, race, English proficiency, whether they had a disability, and whether they had children.\n\n\"Those clustering variables are a pretty good window into what we thought were the important factors for someone's readiness to work,\" Ross said.\n\nThen they used clustering algorithms to group these people based on the attributes they chose.\n\nThey ended up with seven clusters of people that could be easily described, largely using age and educational attainment:\n\nAnd ultimately, these seven clusters give us a framework that can shape the way we think about the out-of-work on both a national and local level.\n\nThe seven types of unemployed people\n\nHere are the seven groups they came up with. I'll give a quick run-down of the groups, but their report delves much deeper into the demographics of each one.\n\nLess-educated young people: This is a diverse group made up of people who don't have high school degrees. They're often those who have either never worked or those who lost their low-wage jobs. About one in three people in this group are raising children under 6, and about one in five are single parents.\n\nLess-educated middle-age people: The people in this group are often not proficient in English, and about one in three people are not US citizens. This is the largest swath of unemployed people nationwide.\n\nLess-educated older people: This group has a hard time reentering the workforce because about one in five people are disabled, and fewer than two-thirds speak English \"very well.\" About half of this group was born outside the US.\n\nModerately educated younger people: These are people who completed some college. For the younger moderately educated, about 39 percent are caring for children under 18, and often they have worked jobs as home health aides and sales representatives. Those who attend school are nontraditional students who are looking for work to get them through school.\n\nModerately educated older people: This group is predominantly white, and 90 percent are US citizens. Ross speculates they are often dislocated workers who gained a lot of on-the-job experience, but were laid off or demand for their skill set has lessened. What's hard about this group is that older folks are less likely to want to go back to school, especially if they're eyeing retirement. Many of them don't have fond memories of school.\n\nAccording to Ross, instead of skill-building programs, policies to help displaced workers might be \"more along the lines of wage insurance to compensate for taking lower-wage jobs, or relocation assistance.\"\n\nHighly educated younger people: The younger folks who are highly educated are predominantly white and Asian, and they are either recently out of school and looking for jobs or laid off and not necessarily in a hurry to find a new job.\n\nHighly educated older people: The older folks are predominantly white, and have a median household income of almost $84,000. So often they are professionals who are waiting for the right job to come along, or people who moved with their families for various reasons and are unable to find work in their fields.\n\nThe most powerful part: localization\n\nNational data on the unemployed isn't particularly useful for local officials.\n\nSo the researchers looked at how their framework played out in various locales — and they saw huge variability. (You can spend some time with their interactive tool to dive deeper into how this data works on a local level.)\n\nHolmes used her hometown, Seattle, as an example. There, the largest swath of the out-of-work population is highly educated high-income people, which isn't exactly a nationwide priority population for policymakers, and it’s a particularly small portion of the nation's unemployed.\n\nBut the localization of data helps diagnose that problem while not obfuscating other types of out-of-work people.\n\nIt's notoriously hard to conceptualize who the out-of-work are. Far too often we think about the unemployed in terms of stereotypes.

          "description": "Are people who prefer their steaks well done just wrong? It’s the question that has divided a nation that is otherwise firmly united on the “steak is great” front, given that we Americans consume about 25 billion pounds of beef annually. It makes ordering at steakhouses for large parties a negotiation; it causes effete elitists like me to reconsider the measure of a diner; and I’m going to guess that the BTUs of gas spent taking perfectly good rare steaks to well done amount to an environmental catastrophe.\n\nA May 2014 investigation from this very website — one which, by my own admission, began as a campaign to smear those who enjoyed well-done beef — found that when people self-reported their steak preferences, most said medium-rare, followed by medium and then medium-well.\n\nBut that’s just what people say they like. We’re living in a society where meat doneness preference has been used as a political cudgel against the holder of the highest office in the U.S. We have to get to the tender, marbled meat of the issue.\n\nLonghorn Steakhouse hooked us up here, agreeing to share aggregated data about how Americans prefer their steak. Longhorn shared a year’s worth of steak orders1 from all of its 491 U.S. locations, revealing how Americans ordered all different cuts of steak. It turns out that Americans claim to like their steak a lot rarer than they actually do!2\n\nThere are serious differences in how people order different cuts, and we wanted to know why.\n\n“Every steak has a different fiber,” said Jens Dahlmann, the executive chef at Longhorn. “If you look at the most tender steak, it’s the tenderloin. That’s a steak that lends itself to barely cooking it. It’s got a very soft fiber and very sweet flavors to it. It works great for rare and medium-rare.”\n\nPrime rib also works great on the rarer side. Because it’s cooked slowly and at low temperatures, a rare order of prime rib can come out without the bloodiness that turns off many rare-averse people. Other steaks can handle more heat.\n\n“Steaks that still perform very well even if you go to a medium-well temperature, those would be the highly marbled steaks, the ribeye, even the porterhouse or T-bone,” Dahlmann said. “There is a bone running through the middle, and around the bone retains more moisture and flavor.”\n\nDavid Berson, director of operations at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, agreed. “Some people like a ribeye rare, but I would recommend cooking it a little longer. It’s got a lot of fat.”\n\nOne way cooks can get a leg up is to buy thicker cuts of beef, which gives them more margin for error than the thin cuts most supermarkets sell. “For home cooks it’s important to get the highest quality they can,” Berson said. “With protein — fish, beef — you don’t want to cut corners.”\n\nMeat buying is a big part of the job at Luger’s. “We look for fat distribution or marbling,” Berson said. “That’ll be a good indication of how juicy the steaks will be.”\n\nDahlmann suggests that home cooks invest in a high-quality meat thermometer to nail the perfect doneness every time. Any steak with an internal temperature from 95 degrees to 105 degrees Fahrenheit is rare, anything from 115 to 125 degrees is medium-rare and, according to FiveThirtyEight culture writer and cantankerous elitist Walt Hickey, anything above that is ruined.\n",

          "description": "While the president of the United States was busy tweeting memes and insulting television personalities this weekend, a video circulated showing the chief justice of the US Supreme Court, John Roberts, encouraging a new generation of young men to be humble and generous.\n\nAs the commencement speaker at his son Jack’s ninth-grade graduation at the Cardigan Mountain School in rural New Hampshire last month, Roberts delivered a humorous speech, telling the new graduates that life would inevitably throw a number of curveballs their way.\n\nHow each boy responded would be a measure of who they are as people, he added.\n\n“I wish you bad luck, from time to time, so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved, and the failure of others is not completely deserved either,” Roberts said. “And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then that your opponent will gloat over your failure, as a way to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored, so you understand the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion.”\n\nRoberts told the graduates that they just gotten through the easiest parts of their lives. And while the road ahead would not be as easy, it would be full of moments to learn from, he said.\n\n“Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen,” he said. “And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon the ability to see the message in your misfortunes.”\n\nRoberts’s speech quickly won accolades for its focus on humility, with Robert Barnes at the Washington Post saying the chief’s justice’s commencement speech was more important than any decision he had handed down from the bench this year.\n\nLA Times editorial writer and former Supreme Court reporter Michael McGough drew a sharp distinction between the speech and the recent antics of President Trump.\n\n“Much of what Roberts said could also plausibly come from the mouth of a president — but not, unfortunately, this one,” McGough wrote.\n\nCardigan Mountain is an all-male junior prep school with an annual tuition costing about as much as that of most universities. But Roberts used his address to remind students that their privileged position comes with a recognition, and responsibility.\n\n“You are also privileged young men, and if you weren’t privileged when you came here, you are now, because you have been here,” he said. “My advice is don’t act like it.”\n\nAs students made their way to their new high schools, Roberts encouraged them to introduce themselves to the staff there, especially “to the person who is raking the leaves, shoveling the snow, or emptying the trash. Learn their name, and call them by their name during your time at school.”\n\nHe told graduates to say hello to everyone they meet, even if they thought it awkward to start out with — and to write their old teachers at Cardigan handmade thank-you notes.\n\nRoberts dispensed a lot of advice throughout his 15-minute speech, but there was one area where he admitted he couldn’t be helpful.\n\n“Most of you will be going to a school with girls. I have no advice for you,” he said, to laughter and applause.\n",

          "description": "President Trump and American millennials have drastically different priorities when it comes to the economy.\n\nTrump wants to boost the shrinking manufacturing industry and revive dying coal jobs. He wants to limit international trade. And he also wants to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\n\nThat doesn’t seem to be at all what young Americans want. A survey of 1,750 Millennials across the country shows that a majority of young Americans (of all races) care most about job wage growth and income inequality —two things that the administration has shown little interest in.\n\nIn May, Trump released a budget that, among other things, drastically increases military spending while cutting funding for welfare programs and scientific research. It’s basically the opposite vision that millennials have for their country, even just white millennials — a demographic group that voted for Trump. For one, they strongly believe that the federal government should increase taxes on the wealthy, not cut their taxes.\n\nHow this generation views the president’s action could have a huge impact on the 2020 elections, as Millennials make up most of the American workforce and have the same share of registered voters as the baby boomer generation. Many, including a large number of young black voters, did not turn out to the polls on Election Day. That had a lot to do with dissatisfaction with the two candidates, said Cathy Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago and lead researcher on the GenForward survey. That could easily be a different story in 2020.\n\n“A lot of millennials were not taken by the Clinton candidacy,” said Cohen. “If another Democrat can fight the right economic agenda to motivate millennials of color to turn out, it would negate any advances that the Trump administration would make.”\n\nThis is what Millennials think the president (and Congress) should be thinking about when it comes to economic policy, according to the GenForward survey, which polled Latino, black, white and Asian adults between the ages of 18 and 34 in April and May.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe most glaring difference between what the president has proposed and what millennials want comes down to taxes. Trump’s tax plan, which he released earlier this year, would overwhelmingly benefit the top income earners in the country, particularly by lowering taxes on owner-operated businesses and eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Yet millennials want the federal government to raise taxes on millionaires, not give them a tax breaks. The vast majority of black, whites, Asians and Latinos felt that way.\n\n GenForward survey\n\nOne reason behind their thinking is that reducing income inequality is one of the top economic priorities for millennials. The gap between rich and poor has been getting worse since the Great Recession, and young Americans want Congress to address this.\n\nTrump’s tax plan would just widen the gulf, as some analysts have argued. If Congress goes along with Trump’s tax plan, it could be the Republican party’s biggest liability in the midterm elections.\n\nInfrastructure spending\n\nThe one economic issue that was heralded as a bipartisan issue is federal spending on rebuilding highways, bridges and airports. Though Trump promised to push for infrastructure spending, so far, Congress has not come up with a bill to make it happen. If they did, it would likely have strong support from young voters. The majority of white, Latino and Asian-American millennials support increased federal spending on infrastructure. On the other hand, most young African-Americans (57 percent) oppose it.\n\n GenForward survey\n\nHere is where Trump and millennials can find common ground when it comes to infrastructure. Both would prefer that spending be in the form of decreased business regulations and tax incentives that would boost infrastructure investment from private businesses. Asian Millennials were the only group that favored direct federal spending on these projects.\n\nBusiness regulation\n\nOne of the core elements of Trump’s economic agenda involves deregulation. One of his most-often repeated mantras involves description of how the federal government is strangling businesses with excessive rules. Whether that means deregulating Wall Street banks or power plants, Trump has been pretty clear that he wants the government to leave businesses alone (hence, the two-for-one rule he instituted shortly after his inauguration).\n\nWhile Millennials think that some deregulation is good to spur infrastructure spending, they don’t seem to agree with Trump that government rules are that bad for businesses. In fact, most young Latino, white and Asian Americans think government regulations are necessary to protect the public. Only a slight majority of black respondents think that business regulations do more harm than good.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n GenForward Survey\n\nRight now, Trump’s budget represents everything that Millennials do not want to see happen. For young African-Americans, the most important economic issue for the president to address is increasing wages. For Asian Americans, it’s reducing the gap between poor and rich. For Latinos, it’s increasing the minimum wage. White millennials want the president to create more jobs.\n\nThe only one of these issues the president seems to care about is creating jobs. So far, his promise to increase manufacturing and coal mining jobs has not materialized.\n",

          "description": "There is an old legend in which Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, is recognized by Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi, as the wisest man alive. It’s notable for Socrates’ response.\n\n“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.”\n\nI think that if Socrates lived today, he would likely have been disappointed. We seem to live in a world where everybody is always certain and nobody is willing to concede that they might be wrong. It seems that it’s more vital to have any old opinion than to truly understand the contents of that opinion.\n\nSomehow, we have decided that it’s okay to hold beliefs based on blind affiliation rather than rigorous critical thought. And if you don’t take a side right away, well, then you are to be shunned or to be labelled as ignorant.\n\nThis likely isn’t new to our age, but it’s very much amplified by the internet. Part of it can be attributed to passion. Understandably, we feel strongly about certain things and that clouds our ability to see the other side. That said, more often than not, the issue lies in our inability to humbly accept that we don’t and can’t know everything; that, often, we are wrong.\n\nThat’s a problem.\n\nThe Irrationality of Certainty\n\nEverything that we see and observe around us is an approximation of sorts. Our senses only take in a small fraction of the available information in our environment, and our brains consciously process an even smaller part.\n\nThere are smells around that we physically can’t smell, there are sights to witness beyond the wavelength that our eyes operate in, there are sounds to be heard that we will never fully hear, and there are influencing thoughts in our subconscious mind that, in many ways, we can’t even begin to relate to.\n\nThis is on a very core level. If we add in the complexity brought on as a result of our interactions with the world through the systems and ideologies we have in place, it’s even more unlikely that we have complete knowledge.\n\nNone of us are ever right. Certainty is an illusion, and there is no shame in being wrong because, by nature, our entire perception of the world is wrong. Over time, we progress and thrive in our surroundings by being less wrong. We feel around, we test, and we question ourselves until something works.\n\nUncertainty isn’t a condition to be avoided, but a tool for better decisions.\n\nThe Disease of Blind Affiliation\n\nThe primary way we mask our discomfort of uncertainty is via affiliation. In some ways, if we don’t have a fully formed opinion, it makes sense to look toward the ideologies, groups, and people who we most generally identify with because there is already a proven track-record of alignment. It’s a useful heuristic—a rule of thumb, if you will—and when it comes to small matters, there likely isn’t too much harm in using that as a shortcut.\n\nThinking is hard work, and it’s worth conserving that energy when possible. The problem occurs when we use our identity as Liberals or Conservatives, or when we let the weight of our loyalty to a personal hero or author, dictate how we make sense of the world rather than critically reasoning ourselves.\n\nIt’s quite a slippery slope, too. If these viewpoints are consequential and important, over time, we get drawn closer to them, and eventually, we form a connection to something that we fundamentally haven’t questioned. That’s no way to live. The dissonance often catches up, and it’s rarely pretty.\n\nEveryone is a sum total of their own unique experiences, and none of these experiences align perfectly with any one person or ideological system. It’s better to not have an opinion than to naively purse someone else’s.\n\nThe Value of “I Don’t Know”\n\nWhen you think about it, acknowledging ignorance is actually productive. Sometimes, the best answer is simply “I don’t know.” Now, that isn’t to give you a reason to exercise indifference or to avoid making difficult decisions. It’s just about choosing to stick to your circle of competence and awareness.\n\nAt any given point, there’s only so much information we can make sense of. On a daily basis, there will be things we don’t understand. If they aren’t relevant, it’s okay not to know. If they are, it’s better to take time to think. This may seem fairly intuitive, and yet, the vast majority of people rarely find themselves comfortable enough to be at ease with not knowing. Instead, they recite from memory whatever has been ingrained into their mind.\n\nThey would rather stand for something with a loose foundation, and they prefer certainty even after being challenged rather than to reconsider. In the long-term, none of these tactics tend to lead to a healthy outlook. “I don’t know” not only keeps us in our circle of competence and awareness where the risk of potential harm is low, but it also works as a feedback tool.\n\nIt’s a competitive advantage because it adds an incentive to critically break things down rather to take the easy way out. It forces us to get smarter. There’s no point standing for something if you have a bad reason to do so.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nLife is complex and messy, and it’s okay not to know everything. It’s fine to take time to form an opinion, and it’s useful to acknowledge ignorance. We live in a world saturated with ideas, and not all of them are good, and not all of them are right for everyone. Ask questions, be critical, and don’t be afraid to change your mind. There are no solid rules against doing so.\n\nNo one makes progress by standing in the same place, and we didn’t get to where we are by always being right. Everything is trial and error, and if you truly want to understand the world, you have to be comfortable with that. It’s okay to open your mind.\n\nWant more?

          "description": "If you’ve ever flown over 100,000 miles in a single year, you’re in elite company. Over 200,000 miles and you’re definitely a top-tier road warrior. But how many people have flown over one million miles in a single year?\n\nTom Stuker has. Twice. And he’s on pace to do it again in 2017.\n\nUnited’s number-one flyer recently passed a major milestone when he reached over 18 million total miles — all on United flights. That’s not 18 million redeemable miles; that’s 18 million flown miles. As in “butt in seat” miles.\n\nUnited celebrated Tom Stuker’s 18 million flown miles at the Polaris lounge in Chicago today with his family and United employees.\nStuker spoke to The Points Guy as the airline prepared to celebrate his accomplishment with a gathering of his family and United employees at the Polaris lounge in Chicago (ORD) held earlier today.\n\n“My first United flight was 1970 or ’71,” he said. “It was my first commercial flight ever, from Chicago to San Antonio. We dropped about 500 feet at one point — no one was hurt but for a first-time flyer I was scared a little bit.”\n\nIn fact, Stuker said he had a fear of flying for the first 10 years he spent in the air. Eventually, he realized if it’s your time to go, it’s your time to go. “I used to get antsy if I had to fly for two weeks,” said Stuker. “Now I get antsy if I’m on the ground for two weeks.”\n\nWhile he’s never had a serious issue in the air, he’s experienced a few on-board incidents. “I’ve never been on a flight where the masks came down, but I’ve been on an aborted takeoff and an aborted landing,” he said. “I’ve been on three different flights where someone died. One of the guys, I was talking to him, then he went to sleep and never woke up.”\n\nStucker with United Vice President Praveen Sharma celebrating 18 million flown miles.\nHow does one end up flying 18 million miles? Stuker is an auto-industry sales and management consultant based in New Jersey, and his work takes him to many individual car dealerships around the world. He’s flown to Hawaii over 100 times and to Australia over 300 times. “I’ve probably seen more of Australia than 95% of Australians,” he said with a laugh.\n\nAfter flying so many miles on United, Stuker is likely the world’s utmost authority when it comes to the airline’s planes and seats. “The three-class 767 is without a doubt my favorite aircraft,” he said, while acknowledging it will soon be phased out in favor of two-cabin Polaris business. His preferred seat on the 767 is 1K, because “typically on an international flight, the pilot [off-duty rest seat] is in 2K with the drapes around him, so 1K feels like a private plane,” he explained. “You’ve got five people in first class so the stewardess gives you plenty of attention.”\n\nWhat about the food? His favorite three dishes on United — in no particular order — are the lobster mac and cheese (“It’s unbelievable, I love it!”), the cinnamon rolls they serve outside the US and the garlic bread. “One food I’m not liking is the salad,” Stuker confided. “They’re getting too fancy with the salad. Apples and grapes and pears. They’ve got everything in it but lettuce and tomatoes. I’m actually thinking of bringing my own.”\n\nBut eating on board depends on the timing of his flight. “Going to Australia, you’re taking off and its 1:30am New York time and I think I’ve had enough meals by 1:30 in the morning,” he said.\n\nStuker and his wife, Darlene. She travels with him multiple times a year.\nWhen Stuker isn’t traveling for work, he likes using his stash of United MileagePlus miles to take leisure trips with others.\n\n“I’m able to use my miles to take my friends and family to places around the world. I’ve taken my son around the world twice,” he said. And those trips aren’t lacking in amenities. “What most people consider a honeymoon trip, I take six times a year with my wife.”\n\nSpeaking of frequent flyer miles, just how many does he have? Stuker would prefer not to disclose an exact number, but he doesn’t use them solely for flights.\n\n“Obviously the best value in using your miles is for flying, but sometimes I’ll redeem for gift cards because there’s only so much flying I have time for outside of work. I use miles for cruises, hotels, rental cars, auctions — United has great auctions.”\n\nStuker is also involved in a cancer charity called Bailey’s Day in Albert, Australia, and donates his miles for the charity’s auctions.\n\nAs a road warrior — perhaps the road warrior — Stuker doesn’t focus on one single hotel chain as he does with his airline. But he still has plenty of annual hotel nights to earn elite status in multiple hotel loyalty programs.\n\n“Right now I’m a lifetime Diamond at Hilton, a lifetime Platinum at Marriott and almost a lifetime Globalist at Hyatt,” he said good-naturedly. “Though I think my streak of being Globalist at Hyatt is going to end this year because they raised it to 60 nights. But when I travel with my wife, I try to raise the bar a little more and stay at a Ritz-Carlton. I love the in-and-out properties where you have a swimming pool villa. When people ask what I like to do on vacation, I say ‘as little as possible.'”\n\nStuker’s accomplishments have become legendary over the years. He’s been covered in the The New York Times, along with ABC News, NBC News and many others. An entire Flyertalk thread is dedicated just to him and is now approaching its eighth year of posts.\n\nStuker prepares to hit the road again, on United as always.\nBut when we asked Stuker if he has any tips on flying, his thoughts centered around being aware and respectful of others. “Try to be more conscious of your surroundings,” he suggested. “If you’re on the phone before you depart, the last three rows of the plane don’t have to hear it. If there’s someone older with a bag, why don’t you get up and help them put it up?”\n\nThe same advice goes for dealing with the airline’s employees: “I’ve always found if you really treat people nice, then the service is out of this world. Like all of us, they like to be appreciated in their job.”\n\nWhat about all of United’s recent bad publicity? “When people say ‘I had a bad experience on United,’ well, I had 9,000 great experiences,” Stuker said. “999 out of 1,000 people who I talk to at Global Services, I rate them a 10 out of 10. These people are like a second family to me. I really appreciate how hard they work.”\n\nWith 18 million miles officially in the rearview mirror, Stuker shows no signs of slowing down — even after more than 45 years of flying.\n\n“The latest I should make 20 million miles is 2020. In all likelihood though, probably sometime in late 2019,” he said. “I really enjoy flying. I really do.”\n\nPhotos courtesy of United Airlines.\n",

          "description": "Late-stage capitalism: such a downer. Consumerism is melting the ice caps, causing social carnage, and burying us under a mountain of sugar. Right?\n\nTrue enough. But what if we could flip this picture on its head? What if we could turn the world’s biggest brands—the brands that consumerism built—into machines for solving the world’s greatest shared problems?\n\nI have a foolish example of how that could look. It centers around Apple, and it owes something to Donald Trump.\n\nStay with me—I’m not a starry-eyed tech utopian. Nor am I naïve when it comes to the primary reason big brands exist, at least as far as most shareholders are concerned: to make money. This idea is practical, and the shareholders should love it, because it would be just as good for Apple as it would be for everyone else.\n\nApple is insanely rich. Back in April, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s cash pile now stands at $250 billion. That’s a record for a non-financial company. It’s more than the entire market value of Walmart, Bank of America, and Proctor & Gamble. It’s more than the GDP of New Zealand or Finland. In fact, Apple could afford to give all 4.6 million citizens of New Zealand a cheque for $54,000 dollars. Which would be a nice gesture, given reports that Apple has paid zero tax in NZ for a decade now, despite sales across that period of NZD 4.2 billion.\n\nBut while Apple has been accumulating cash, the product lines are a mess. iTunes is a crime against interface design. Tim Cook says the Apple Watch is selling just fine, but it’s simply not the revolution some people thought it would be. The touch bar: meh. The HomePod, announced at June’s WWDC 2017, was a necessary and expected play if Siri is to stand any chance against Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nBy any standard, Apple is still a great company. But even the brand’s most ardent admirers have to admit that something has changed since its imperial phase, back when there seemed something different about Apple versus any other company. Apple is at the start of a long, slow drift toward average. And Apple Park, their new HQ in Cupertino that took five years and $5 billion to build, is a pretty powerful symbol of that change. Apple can obsess over door handles for employees, but it can’t fix iTunes for customers. Apple Park is the most exciting new product the company has released since the iPad.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. Apple can once again become a company that changes everything; it can point the way forward for consumerism in these polarized, post-truth times, and it can save itself in the process.\n\nHere’s how. Most of Apple’s $250 billion is held overseas. Apple hasn’t brought the money back to the US because it would have to pay tax on it if it did. But now it looks as though the Trump administration will reform tax laws to allow businesses to repatriate cash without incurring such a tax hit. If Apple brings back even a fraction of its pile, it will have to undertake some serious thinking: What shall we do with all this money?\n\nHere’s an idea: help reinvent capitalism.\n\nWe live at a time when Apple and other corporations can accumulate unprecedented riches while income for most working people has been stagnating for decades. Indeed, for the last three decades the gains from economic growth have been hoarded by corporations. Inequality in affluent countries is growing. Many economists agree that this is a problem for everyone, because the 1% can’t spend fast enough to support the economy. Under this view, the economies of the US and others are suffering from a chronic lack of demand. That’s only set to get worse when automation eats a ton of middle class jobs.\n\nSo what can Apple do? It could fund the largest trial of the universal basic income ever.\n\nIt’s become commonplace to observe that UBI is an idea whose time has come. A guaranteed income for every citizen could narrow inequality, pump up demand, alleviate the crushing effects of job automation, and solve the emerging crisis in care for the elderly by freeing people to look after older relatives.\n\nWhat’s more, evidence is growing that when you give people free money, they don’t just sleep all day and play video games. They educate themselves. They start small businesses. They care for children and parents. Isn’t that what human flourishing looks like?\n\nTrials of UBI are popping up everywhere. The seed-capital firm Y Combinator is currently running a trial with 100 families in Oakland. Finland is paying 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people €560 a month for two years. Ontario is about to run a trial with 4,000 participants for three years.\n\nThe Y Combinator trial is great, but they are a minnow. We’re still waiting for a true Valley giant to step up and say, “Let’s find answers.” Apple could afford a trial that would surpass any of those in scale. How about 5,000 families, $12,000 dollars each, for five years? That would cost $300 million. Sure, there’s also the costs for set up, running the trial, and researching the data—but it’s small change when you’re sitting on $250 billion.\n\nApart from its money, Apple makes a natural fit for values-based reasons. The company has always positioned itself as an insurgent willing to Think Different in order to fix a broken established order. In 2017, the most powerful way to stand by that heritage is not by making another device: It’s by daring to think different on the system—that is, 21st-century consumerism—that underpins their success.\n\nOf course, Apple can’t fix a problem this big on its own. But if it ran a successful UBI trial, who knows who else would want to get involved? And way before then, just because Apple is showing it even cares about this stuff, it will benefit from a massive upswing in public sentiment, and the revitalization that comes with doing something that really matters.\n\nSo that’s my challenge to Apple. Give away a ton of money. Refocus around an insanely great mission to solve capitalism. Help rewire consumerism for the 21st century by inspiring other brands to act on the urgent shared challenge they are best placed to solve. (Hey, I said it was a foolish idea. Then again, Steve did say to stay foolish.)\n\nThe shareholders probably won’t like it. But finding a way to have a massive positive impact is the best way for any big legacy brand to assure continued survival in the decades ahead. It could change everything. And no one will care about the iTunes interface if Apple truly once again becomes a company on a mission to change the world.\n\nOh and one more thing: Woz says Apple should pay 50% tax. And he likes the universal basic income. That’s basically an endorsement. Right?\n\nFollow David on Twitter. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.\n",

          "description": "Deciding how to redeem your Ultimate Rewards points can seem like a daunting task, especially when you consider all of Chase’s transfer partners. Sometimes it seems like redeeming Ultimate Rewards for 1.5 cents each (with the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card) or 1.25 cents each (with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card) through Chase’s travel portal is the best way to go. And, it might be, but you could be leaving points on the table. Here’s how I decide how to redeem my points.\n\nFirst, I think about where I’m going and which airlines can get me there. If you’re traveling to a fairly popular destination, there’s a good chance that at least one airline from each major alliance (Oneworld, Star, and SkyTeam) will fly there. If you’re flying to a smaller or off the beaten path destination, your options might be more limited. Either way, the easiest place to find out which airlines fly to a specific destination is through the Wikipedia page for the airport you want to fly to. If I wanted to go to Saigon, Vietnam, this would be the Wikipedia page I check, just scroll down the the ‘airlines and destinations section’ and focus on the airlines.\n\nNext, I would check my points options to fly there. I would only consider the cost at this time and not look into availability. As a reminder, here are the Ultimate Rewards transfer partners:\n\nUnited\n\nSingapore\n\nKorean\n\nKLM/Air France Flying Blue\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nBritish Airways\n\nSouthwest\n\nIf only considering redeeming Ultimate Rewards, these are the only airline award charts I would look at.\n\nIf you’re flying outside of the U.S., Caribbean, and Mexico, you can automatically ignore Southwest, but the concept is still similar if you are flying within that region.\n\nFor long haul flights, it’s pretty much a given that you can ignore British Airways, and you can also generally ignore Virgin Atlantic. If you want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, go ahead and check them anyway, the concept is the same.\n\nFor the sake of this post, we will only look at the award prices for United, Singapore, Korean, and KLM/Air France.\n\nYou can look up award charts individually, but I like to use Flyer Miler or Award Maximizer to compare many programs at the same time. However, keep in mind that these tools are not always perfectly accurate. Let’s continue with the Vietnam trip example, and we will assume that the departure airport is Lexington, KY and that we are interested in an economy class flight.\n\nUnited (Star Alliance) – 40,000 miles each way\n\nSingapore (Star Alliance) – 55,000 miles each way\n\nKorean (SkyTeam) – 45,000 miles each way\n\nKLM/Air France (SkyTeam) – 40,000 miles each way\n\nSince only two alliances are represented with these transfer partners, we only need to consider the lowest priced option from each alliance. This is because, for the most part, the same award availability is available for all partners within the alliance. In both cases, the lowest award price available is 40,000 miles each way, or 80,000 miles round trip.\n\nNow it’s time to forget about awards for a minute and take a look at the cash prices for a ticket. Let’s assume that you’re interested in traveling in November for 10-12 days, and are pretty flexible about when you go. Use your favorite flight search tool (mine is ITA Matrix) to check airfare prices.\n\nAt time of writing, the lowest price I found fitting these constraints was $1,012 roundtrip. Now, if I wanted to redeem my Ultimate Rewards through Chase’s travel portal, the value depends on which card or cards I have. With the Chase Sapphire Reserve, points are worth 1.5 cents each. I would need 67,467 Ultimate Rewards to pay for this $1,012 airfare – less that what’s required by transfer partners for the redemption. If I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, my points are only worth 1.25 cents each and I would need 80,960 Ultimate Rewards points – slightly more than transferring to a partner. This is all found out without even checking award availability and knowing what the taxes and fees would be on the award tickets. In this case, there’s a clear winner if I have the CSR and a likely winner even if I only have the CSP because airline taxes and fees haven’t yet been accounted for.\n\nThe next step, assuming it does make sense to utilize a transfer partner, is to look for award space. If award space exists for your travel dates, book it! If it doesn’t and you can’t adjust your travel dates, then either book through Chase Travel or consider booking with cash and saving your points for a future trip.\n\nIf it’s a really close case and you need to consider airline taxes and fees, you need to subtract them from the ticket price. For example, lets say for this Vietnam trip, United does have availability but charges $80 round trip for taxes. That means you can either pay 80,960 points through Chase (if you have the CSP) or pay 80,000 United miles + $80 in taxes – both options save you $1,012. Now you need to calculate the value you are getting out of your points. You already know it’s 1.25 cents in the case of the CSP redemption, but you’ll also earn a few thousand miles from flying the fare. In the case of the transfer to United, you’re really only saving $1,012-$80=$932 for your 80,000 miles. This means your points are only worth 1.165 cents each ($932.00/80,000). In this case, it would be better to redeem your miles through Chase’s travel portal.\n\nHow do you decide whether to redeem points through Chase Travel or transfer to a partner?\n",

But it defeats the point of sleeping next to your person — if you’re spooning through a duvet, you might as well hug a body pillow.\n\nSmartDuvet, the company that first launched a self-making bed on Kickstarter, is now offering a second edition that lets two people adjust their preferred temperatures on their side of the bed. The SmartDuvet Breeze, like its predecessor, is basically a blow-up air-blanket you put on your duvet, inside your duvet cover. (Do you have a duvet cover? I don’t. Should I have a duvet cover?) It attaches to a control box, which you might be able to hide under your bed.\n\n SmartDuvet\n\nThink of the control box as a mechanized air pump. SmartDuvet makes the bed by filling up the bed like a pool toy. Because it’s attached to your bedding, it pulls everything with it as it fills with air. Your bed will be “made” when it reaches its final form.\n\nThrough an app, you can control the climate of each side of the SmartDuvet Breeze by blowing warm or cold air from control box. It’s dual-layered to include the bed-making and the temperature control air tubes, which you connect to the blanket during setup.\n\n SmartDuvet\n\nSmartDuvet creators claim that it’s not just good for your comfort, but that bed oxygenation will reduce sweat and prevent bed-bugs. They also say it’s a green product since you wouldn’t be heating or cooling your whole house to your desired temperature. Joke’s on you, SmartDuvet, I live in New York City and I can’t control my apartment’s thermostat. But it’s a nice idea.\n\nIt’s more than 550 percent funded on Indiegogo at time of publish and we demoed the first SmartDuvet at CES 2017, so while there’s no guarantee on receiving your crowdfunded product, this could actually ship in September 2017 as advertised.\n\nFor now, SmartDuvet Breeze is taking early pledges starting at $199. Once on market, the company aims to sell it for $359.\n",

          "description": "They were just trying to pray in peace.\n\nLate Sunday night, Muslim worshippers celebrating Ramadan at London’s Finsbury Park Mosque exited services onto the nearby Seven Sisters Road. A white van careened off the street and slammed into the crowd, killing one and injuring at least eight others. The driver, a 48-year-old white man, reportedly yelled, “I want to kill all Muslims” before he was apprehended by members of the crowd he attacked.\n\nAfterward, all eyes turned to UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Earlier this month, jihadists killed eight in an attack on London Bridge that also involved a van ramming pedestrians. After that attack, May said that there was “far too much tolerance” of “Islamist extremism” in the UK and called for civil liberties restrictions (like limits on free speech online) in response. Would her response be as aggressive when Muslims were the victims rather than the perpetrators?\n\nYes, as it turns out — it was.\n\n\"This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal,\" she said. \"It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism, and hatred take many forms, and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible.”\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May announces new commission for countering extremism in wake of #FinsburyPark attack https://t.co/if2uFwOLPo http://pic.twitter.com/FFMa497o1k\n— CNN International (@cnni) June 19, 2017\n\n“Excellent and powerful statement from Theresa May on Finsbury Park,” tweeted Brendan Cox, an anti-hate activist whose wife, Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament, was murdered last year by a right-wing, anti-Muslim extremist.\n\nCox also noticed something else. Donald Trump, who immediately condemned the London Bridge attack and used it to argue for his controversial travel ban, has yet to comment to the attack in Finsbury Park.\n\n. @realDonaldTrump I fear u may have missed it but there was a terror attack last night in London on Muslims. Looking fwd to yr condemnation\n— Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) June 19, 2017\n\nTrump still has not tweeted on the matter. It took until late on Monday afternoon for the White House to offer any statement, saying that \"thoughts and prayers go out to our British allies.\" \n\nThere’s a lesson here: a lesson on how a normal leader handles hate crimes, and how Donald J. Trump does it. \n\nTheresa May is hardly a champion of inclusion\n\nIt’s important to understand that May is not historically a champion for the rights of Britain’s Muslim minority.\n\nMay was home secretary, a position responsible for (among other things) internal security, prior to becoming prime minister. During that time, she championed something called the Prevent program — a counter-extremism program introduced in 2003 that had been heavily criticized for singling out Muslims for police attention. In 2011, May introduced a plan for the program to focus on “extremist ideology,” an idea that experts have criticized as dangerously vague.\n\n“The Home Secretary does fail to identify what the terms ‘extremism’ and ‘radicalisation’ actually mean, or provide any robust research or insights as to who might be an ‘extremist,” Brian Blakemore, an expert on UK homeland security policy at the University of South Wales, wrote at the time. “The problem with this lack of detail is the potential to profile … the police could use their powers of investigation to arrest innocent Muslims purely because of their ethnicity, name, and religion.”\n\nPrevent hasn’t changed very much since May became prime minister last year. This led Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a member of May’s Conservative Party who served as minister for faith and communities while May was home secretary, to publicly criticize the prime minister in a recent interview with the UK Times. Warsi called Prevent “toxic,” adding, “I think Theresa May needs to pause, she needs to reassess what Prevent is about.” She linked this to a broader problem with anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK.\n\n\"I think Islamophobia is Britain's bigotry blind spot,” Warsi said. “I would like a prime minister or home secretary to stand up and say, ‘We all want to fight the war on terror, but Muslims are not fair game.’\"\n\nSunday night’s attack in Finsbury Park was the acid test as to whether Theresa May would be able to follow through on Warsi’s challenge. If you can’t condemn anti-Muslim hatred after it claimed the life of one of your citizens, when could you ever?\n\nBut May passed the test.\n\n“This extremism every bit as insidious and destructive to our values and our way of life [as jihadism],” she said after the Finsbury Park Mosque attack. “There has been far too much tolerance of extremism … and that means extremism of any kind including Islamophobia.”\n\nThis is the bare minimum of what you could expect from a leader in this position. May, a champion of controversial and arguably discriminatory counterterrorism policies, still managed to come out and publicly condemn attacks on Muslim worshippers as harshly as she had condemned attacks committed by Muslims.\n\nIt’s a bar that Trump can’t ever seem to clear. \n\nContrast May with Trump\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nWhile Trump jumps at any report of suspected Islamist terrorism — even ones that haven’t been confirmed — he usually takes days to mention attacks on Muslims if he mentions them at all. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump lists two examples:\n\nIt took days for him to praise the two men who were stabbed to death in Portland while defending Muslim women on a train. It took almost a week for him to speak out about the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas by someone who thought that they were Muslim. In one sense, it’s odd that Trump hasn’t tweeted condolences to the victims in London, given the criticism he’s received for his slow response to the above attacks — but, again, it’s not surprising that he hasn’t, given that history.\n\nBump’s cases are particularly telling because they were in the United States. Trump can’t seem to get interested in Islamophobic terrorist attacks inside America’s borders, yet the “America first” president jumps at opportunities to highlight reports of Islamist violence in places like Britain and the Philippines.\n\nThe reason why is fairly obvious.\n\nAttacks targeting Muslims do nothing for Trump’s political agenda, and don’t fit into his worldview (which positions Islam principally a source of violence). When Muslims commit attacks, by contrast, Trump can use that as a justification for his policies singling out Muslims — most notably the travel ban targeting individuals from Muslim countries.\n\n“The idea of Muslims being victimized doesn't fit his domestic or foreign policy agenda,” Shahed Amanullah, an Obama-era State Department official, told my Vox colleague Sarah Wildman. “He doesn't even respond to something like Portland with basic humanity, both because Muslims are not a core constituency and because it interrupts his narrative of Muslims being a threat.”\n\nThe reaction to the two London attacks, then, are emblematic of Trump’s real concerns. He’s not concerned with political violence or terrorism in general — the fact that people are being murdered in the name of extremist ideology. He’s only concerned with violence that comes from a specific group that espouses a specific strain of extremist ideology. \n\nWhich is precisely why we’re not hearing calls to ban white Britons from entering the United States until Trump can “figure out what’s going on.” Violence committed by anyone other than Muslims just doesn’t seem to be on Trump’s radar.

          "description": "A provocative new paper argues for closing down all — or at least close to all — US prisons.\n\nAmerica should abolish prisons. Perhaps not all of them, but very close to it.\n\nThat’s the argument in a recent, provocative paper by Peter Salib, a judicial clerk to Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Frank Easterbrook.\n\nAccording to Salib, the idea behind the criminal justice system should be to punish and deter crimes. But prisons are arguably a very inefficient way to do that. The research shows that long prison sentences have little impact on crime, and a stint in prison can actually make someone more likely to commit crime — by further exposing them to all sorts of criminal elements. At the same time, prisons are incredibly costly, eating up funds that could go to other government programs that are more effective at fighting crime.\n\nSo why not, Salib suggests, consider alternative approaches to punishment that can let someone actually pay their debt back to society without forcing taxpayers to shoulder the burden of paying for his full confinement?\n\nSalib gave the example of an accountant who burned down an office building. Instead of locking him up for potentially decades, Salib suggests keeping an eye on him through other means, such as GPS monitoring, and forcing him to work as an accountant to pay back the cost of the office building. This would, he argues, be much better for everyone involved; the office building owner gets paid back for the damage, and society has to pay much less to confine this person.\n\nThe idea is a bit discomforting, not least because it sounds like forced labor or slavery. Coupled with the massive racial disparities in the justice system, the idea takes an ugly turn.\n\nBut Salib makes two points: First, forced labor is certainly punishing, but prison is very punishing as well — arguably more so.\n\nSecond, Salib argues that we can try to make the justice system fairer while changing how it punishes people. “If you think that we shouldn’t punish as many minorities as we do now, that’s fine,” he told me. “I’m not asking about who we should punish; I’m asking about how we punish the people we do punish.”\n\nThis isn’t a wholly new concept. Previously, Dylan Matthews wrote for Vox about how we could get rid of prisons by using location-tracking technology to monitor offenders while otherwise letting them live productive lives. And criminal justice experts Mark Kleiman, Angela Hawken, and Ross Halperin previously proposed a “graduated reentry” system that would similarly monitor people convicted of crimes, but incentivize them to slowly re-earn their freedom by proving their rehabilitation — getting a job, following a curfew, not committing other crimes, and so on. This could incentivize the inmate to be productive, while avoiding the higher costs of prison.\n\nStill, Salib makes one of the clearer cases for how this change would be better not just for prisoners, but for society as a whole. You should read the full paper for more detail. But to follow up on some of the lingering questions I had — how his system works for murderers, and what kinds of exceptions he envisions that would still warrant prison — I reached out to Salib. What follows is our full conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nWhat is the main argument in your paper?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nWe start with the law and economics premise of criminal punishment, which is that the main thing we’re interested in when we punish people is deterring anti-social behavior — imposing costs on people so it’s not advantageous for them to make everyone’s life worse.\n\nFor various reasons having to do with how hard it is to figure out when people are doing bad stuff to sufficiently deter them, the costs have to be sufficiently high. In layman terms that means we usually can’t just extract money from them, but we sometimes have to do other things. The way our system usually does that now, if criminal punishment is necessary, is imprisonment.\n\nThe argument in the paper is that if our starting premise is the economic premise of minimizing social costs, we should look at other social costs [related to prison].\n\nIt turns out prison is really costly. It may be pretty good at deterring the bad acts we want to deter. But it has high administrative costs. It creates a lot of perverse incentives.\n\nAnd, most importantly, if I’m a guy who would otherwise be a productive member of society and I get put in prison, part of the cost to me of being in prison is that I don’t get to earn any money and enjoy the fruits of my labor while I’m in prison. It turns out that’s also a cost to society: If there was some other punishment that also allowed me to work in a socially productive way, we could take the money I earned and give it to, say, my victims or, if my victim has already been compensated, the government or a nonprofit that would distribute it to other people who need it. That would be a lot better from a social standpoint.\n\nThe second half of the paper says it’s not so out there that we could have a different system besides prison. When somebody is convicted of having done some bad stuff we think needs to be deterred, we first exhaust the monetary transfers we could make. So we say you have to keep working to pay your debt to society with actual money to the extent you can.\n\nIf it turns out there needs to be additional costs on the person, there are lots of additional things you could do. There are some that are historical, and maybe people think some of those are too horrible and archaic. But if you don’t like those, you can pick anything you like. You could have public shaming as a punishment. If you don’t think that’s harsh enough, you could have other modern-day costly punishments — you could make people eat very spicy peppers on a regular basis or have them do something else that’s unpleasant on a regular basis.\n\nThe idea is that there are options that don’t keep people from working and remaining a productive member of society. So not a drain, but rather beneficial to others while still being deterred.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nThe way we usually talk about prison, we mostly talk about the costs to the prisoner. “Now he has to pay for his crime”: That’s the frame most people think about with prisons. But I think you’re right that people tend to overlook some of the other social costs. To give readers a better idea of what some of the social costs of prison are, could you walk me through them?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nSay I’m an accountant. But I have a streak of pyromania, so I burn down a big office building.\n\nUnder the current system, I go to prison. Let’s say I get sent to 30 years of prison for serious arson. Part of the cost for me is, in addition to being confined to my prison cell and not being able to be with my family and loved ones, I don’t get to earn any money while I’m in prison. And when I get out, I have foregone 30 years of my salary. That’s a cost to me. But it’s also a cost to everyone else.\n\nImagine if instead of getting sent to prison, the court tells me I have to repay the costs of the office building. But I don’t have the savings to do that. If instead of being sent to prison, I was forced to continue working as an accountant to give, say, 80 percent of my earnings for however long to whoever’s office building I burned down, that would actually be a lot better to the guy whose office building I burned down.\n\nThe fact that I get sent to prison and am prevented from earning any wealth while I’m there is as much taking money out of my victim’s pocket as it is taking money out of my pocket.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nI could see someone latching onto that framing and arguing that sounds a lot like forced labor or slavery, especially with racial disparities in the criminal justice system. It could have some pretty ugly implications. How would you respond to that?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nI do worry about it. Part of the reason I don’t engage with it very much in the paper is, one, the paper is really supposed to be narrowly a law and economics piece. There are other kinds of reasons we might want to do this. There are moral objections to this and some of the alternative punishments being imposed. As a law and economics matter, though, the point is this system is more efficient.\n\nParticularly in regards to racial disparities in incarceration in America, there is a lot of research on that. It is very good. I buy that there are racial disparities that can’t be explained or are hard to explain by good reasons.\n\nBut there’s nothing incompatible with the idea that we should be fairer about who we punish and that we might want to punish them in a different way. I can accept the objection that the American system of criminal punishment is unfair along the racial lines. If you think that we shouldn’t punish as many minorities as we do now, that’s fine. I’m not asking about who we should punish; I’m asking about how we punish the people we do punish.\n\nThe other thing: If you think forced labor is bad because of American slavery, I don’t think that’s wrong either. I just point out in the paper that prisoners in our current system do work. We do have forced labor for prisoners now. It just turns out there aren’t a lot of ways for people who are locked up in a cell to do high-value labor. So that undercompensates people who are victims of crime who could be compensated more if people were using their talents more productively.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nThere are some crimes that don’t have a hard monetary value attached to them — like murder, where it’s hard to measure the value of a human life. So how do you approach those situations?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nIt’s right that it’s very difficult to put a value on a human life. That’s given by the fact that most of us would pay potentially any sum of money to prevent our impending death.\n\nThe point of this system is not to put a dollar value on a life and then extract that from the murderer. The point of this system is to figure out how much private cost we want to impose on the murderer to keep him from killing the person in the first place. That might be — in fact, likely is — a lot less than the value of a human life. If you think the value of a human life approaches infinity, you probably don’t have to impose an infinite amount of costs on a potential murderer to deter him from murdering.\n\nSo when we’re thinking about how much punishment to inflict, how much private cost to impose on a potential bad actor, we’re really thinking less about the losses of the victim — which can be enormous and likely irreparable. The best we can do in a system of criminal law is figure out what threat we need to make to murderers to keep them from murdering. That’s the cost we’re thinking of.\n\nThe idea, then, is that as much of that punishment as possible should be paid in the form of money instead of a form of discomfort, confinement, or things that can’t be transferred. As far as we’re imposing costs on bad actors like murderers, it’s senseless to destroy wealth when we could make those people generate wealth and give it to their victims or give it to their governments.\n\nThat’s not to fully say we’ll ever fully compensate the family of a murder victim. The only idea is that there’s no sense in having them lose a loved one and then giving them nothing, because we’ve locked up the person who did it.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nWhat are some of the other alternatives to prison that you think are plausible, besides forced labor?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nIn the system I suggest, the only way there is some economic efficiency is if there is a required labor component. The whole idea is that instead of destroying people’s wealth, you let them generate wealth and transfer it — either to victims or the government or someone else who we think would do good things with the money. So that’s kind of the baseline.\n\nThe idea for additional punishment comes from the fact that if I steal $10,000, you might think that having me pay $10,000 back is good enough to deter me from having stolen it in the first place. But it turns out we only catch some thieves. So if we only catch 50 percent of thieves, and account for my expected value of a $10,000 jewel, the actual [deterrent] value is $20,000 — because there’s only a 50 percent chance I’ll have to pay it back.\n\nThe idea is that high penalties are required as long as we don’t catch that many criminals. So we have people work so they repay victims and society so much as that’s possible. But insofar as some people do some socially costly stuff, there will sometimes be a higher required punishment than people can pay for in money. That’s where some other sanction comes in. I call these non-monetary sanctions.\n\nThe paper is completely agnostic about what and how many non-monetary sanctions we should impose.\n\nIn the American colonial days, we had pillory — putting people in the stock and humiliating them. We had flogging. We had tarring and feathering (although it was often extrajudicial, not sanctioned).\n\nThe point isn’t to endorse those punishments. I think there are valid objections to those punishments — especially because they look a lot like the things that we did to American slaves, and that’s very ugly.\n\nThe paper says we don’t need to do that. You can invent anything you like. Whatever you think is the right way to impose costs on people who’ve harmed others in society, that’s okay.\n\nThere are judges out in America who are inventing these kinds of things. They’re often a little bit silly. So after someone made his daughter sleep in the doghouse, the judge made him sleep in the doghouse. There’s a similar eye-for-an-eye story for a judge who made someone get a very bad haircut.\n\nA lot of people would probably say those are probably not costly enough to impose on many people who do bad things. That’s fine too. Pick something between a bad haircut and whatever you think the extreme is.\n\nIf you think part of the effectiveness of prison is it confines people, you could have people live in very confining conditions when they’re not working. It could be, really, anything that we think, as a society, is humane and effective.\n\nCertainly, punishing people can be hard to stomach. I agree with that. But one thing I put in the paper is prison is really hard to stomach if you’re intimately familiar with it. Prison is a place where we send people to be subject to incredible rates of violence, incredible rates of sexual assault, [and] often more limited medical care.\n\nIf you object to how brutal prison is, then under my system you can impose something less brutal in the world. But you shouldn’t object to moving away from prison to something that seems brutal without also recognizing that prison as we do it now is a pretty nasty place.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nI wanted to bring that up. I think there’s an underlying bias for the status quo. People don’t always think of prison as this brutal place. But as you mentioned, there are high rates of violence and sexual assault. Even if there weren’t higher rates of violence, just imagining yourself in a position where you are stuck somewhere for years in this monotonous, terrifying situation, that still seems like a brutal environment to be in. So while flogging seems harsher to me, it’s certainly true that prison is harsh. It’s bizarre to not consider that when criticizing or vetoing these other forms of punishment you mentioned.\n\nSo it seems like the point is that people should think about alternative punishments more seriously and start thinking outside the box for this, acknowledging that prison is by itself fairly harsh and inefficient.\n\nPeter Salib\n\nThat’s right.\n\nOne reason for the status quo bias is we need prisons to keep dangerous people out of society and therefore prevent them from committing crime. But I think alternatives to prison might actually do better on that count.\n\nThere’s a fair amount of research that there’s actually a causal relationship between years of imprisonment and lifetime crimes committed. We think prison as reducing crime, because it takes people who we think would commit crimes and puts them away so they can’t commit them. But it actually has the opposite effect: Maybe you can’t commit a crime while you’re in prison, but you commit a bunch more [crimes] once you get out.\n\nSo for many people who commit crimes, it may be possible to stop them from committing more crimes while they’re out in the world, working and contributing to society, because we have all this cool technology now that we didn’t have before. We have very good location-detection technology. We can really make sure people are where they’re supposed to be using biometric technology. We can monitor them. Our smartphones have every kind of data transfer you’d like, from voice to video to pictures to text.\n\nWe just have to think outside the box with how we use criminal punishment as a mechanism for preventing future crimes in a way that doesn’t involve just putting people in a cage.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nAre there exceptions in this system? Are there some people who do need to go to prison?\n\nPeter Salib\n\nThere are at least some murderers — I’m thinking of, at the very least, the kind of psychotic serial killers, the Ted Bundys of the world — that probably we really should keep away from society. Insofar as there is some percentage of people who really are an irreparable danger to society, the paper concedes that okay, maybe those people really do need to be locked up.\n\nIt might not be everyone who commits a violent crime, but there are certainly some people for who prison is the right answer. But it’s almost certainly a small fraction of the millions we incarcerate in America now.",

          "description": "There’s a certain type of financial confessional that has had a way of going viral in the post-recession era. The University of Chicago law professor complaining his family was barely keeping their heads above water on $250,000 a year. This hypothetical family of three in San Francisco making $200,000, enjoying vacations to Maui, and living hand-to-mouth. This real New York couple making a six figures and merely “scraping by.”\n\nIn all of these viral posts, denizens of the upper-middle class were attempting to make the case for their middle classness. Taxes are expensive. Cities are expensive. Tuition is expensive. Children are expensive. Travel is expensive. Tens of thousands of dollars a month evaporate like cold champagne spilled on a hot lanai, they argue. And the 20 percent are not the one percent.  \n\nA great, short book by Richard V. Reeves of the Brookings Institution helps to flesh out why these stories provoke such rage. In Dream Hoarders, released this week, Reeves agrees that the 20 percent are not the one percent: The higher you go up the income or wealth distribution, the bigger the gains made in the past three or four decades. Still, the top quintile of earners—those making more than roughly $112,000 a year—have been big beneficiaries of the country’s growth. To make matters worse, this group of Americans engages in a variety of practices that don’t just help their families, but harm the other 80 percent of Americans.\n\n“I am not suggesting that the top one percent should be left alone. They need to pay more tax, perhaps much more,” Reeves writes. “But if we are serious about narrowing the gap between ‘the rich’ and everybody else, we need a broader conception of what it means to be rich.”\n\nThe book traces the way that the upper-middle class has pulled away from the middle class and the poor on five dimensions: income and wealth, educational attainment, family structure, geography, and health and longevity. The top 20 percent of earners might not have seen the kinds of income gains made by the top one percent and America’s billionaires. Still, their wage and investment increases have proven sizable. They dominate the country’s top colleges, sequester themselves in wealthy neighborhoods with excellent public schools and public services, and enjoy healthy bodies and long lives. “It would be an exaggeration to say that the upper-middle class is full of gluten-avoiding, normal-BMI joggers who are only marginally more likely to smoke a cigarette than to hit their children,” Reeves writes. “But it would be just that—an exaggeration, not a fiction.”\n\nThey then pass those advantages onto their children, with parents placing a “glass floor” under their kids. They ensure they grow up in nice zip codes, provide social connections that make a difference when entering the labor force, help with internships, aid with tuition and home-buying, and schmooze with college admissions officers. All the while, they support policies and practices that protect their economic position and prevent poorer kids from climbing the income ladder: legacy admissions, the preferential tax treatment of investment income, 529 college savings plans, exclusionary zoning, occupational licensing, and restrictions on the immigration of white-collar professionals.  \n\nAs a result, America is becoming a class-based society, more like fin-de-siècle England than most would care to admit, Reeves argues. Higher income kids stay up at the sticky top of the income distribution. Lower income kids stay down at the bottom. The one percent have well and truly trounced the 99 percent, but the 20 percent have done their part to immiserate the 80 percent, as well—an arguably more salient but less recognized class distinction.\n\nWhy more salient? In part because the 20 percent are so much bigger than the one percent. If you are going to raise a considerable amount of new income tax revenue to finance social programs, as may Democrats want to do, dinging the top one percent won’t cut it: They are a lot richer, but a lot fewer in number. And if you are going to provide more opportunities in good neighborhoods, public schools, colleges, internship programs, and labor markets to lower-income families, it is the 20 percent that are going to have to give something up.\n\nReeves offers a host of policy changes that might make a considerable difference: better access to contraception, increasing building in cities and suburbs, barring legacy admissions to colleges, curbing tax expenditures that benefit families with big homes and capital gains. Still, given the scale of the problem, I wondered whether other, bigger solutions might be necessary as well: a universal child allowance to reduce the poverty rate among kids, as the Century Foundation has proposed, say, or baby bonds to help eliminate the black-white wealth gap fostered by decades of racist and exclusionary government policy, as Darrick Hamilton has suggested. (So often, the upper-middle class insulating and enriching itself at the expense of the working class has meant white families doing so at the expense of black families—a point I thought underplayed in Reeves’ telling.)\n\nYet, as Reeves notes, “sensible policy is not always easy politics.” Expanding opportunity and improving fairness would require the upper-middle class to vote for higher taxes, to let others move in, and to share in the wealth. Prying Harvard admission letters and the mortgage interest deduction out of the hands of bureaucrats in Bethesda, sales executives in Minnetonka, and lawyers in Louisville is not going to be easy.\n\nMembers of the upper-middle class, as those viral stories show and Reeves writes, love to think of themselves as members of the middle class, not as the rich. They love to think of themselves as hard workers who played fair and won what they deserved, rather than as people who were born on third and think they hit a triple. They hate to hear that the government policies they support as sensible might be torching social mobility and entrenching an elite. That elite is them.\n",

          "description": "In the early 1960s, Richard Feynman gave a series of undergraduate lectures that were collected into a book called the Feynman Lectures on Physics. Absent from the book was a lecture Feynman gave on planetary motion, but a later finding of the notes enabled David Goodstein, a colleague of Feynman’s, to write a book about it: Feynman’s Lost Lecture. From an excerpt of the book published in a 1996 issue of Caltech’s Engineering & Science magazine:\n\nFeynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, “Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.” Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.” But he came back a few days later to say, “I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t really understand it.”\n\nJohn Gruber writes the simple explanations are the goal at Apple as well:\n\nEngineers are expected to be able to explain a complex technology or product in simple, easily-understood terms not because the executive needs it explained simply to understand it, but as proof that the engineer understands it completely.\n\nFeynman was well known for simple explanations of scientific concepts that result a in deeper understanding of the subject matter: e.g. see Feynman explaining how fire is stored sunshine, rubber bands, how trains go around curves, and magnets. Critically, he’s also not shy about admitting when he doesn’t understand something…or, alternately, when scientists as a group don’t understand something. There’s the spin anecdote above and of his explanation of magnets, he says:\n\nI really can’t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else you’re more familiar with, because I don’t understand it in terms of anything else you’re more familiar with.\n\nFeynman was also quoted as saying:\n\nI think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\n\nPretty interesting thing to hear from a guy who won a Nobel Prize for explaining quantum mechanics better than anyone ever had before. Even when he died in 1988 at the end of a long and fruitful careeer, a note at the top of his blackboard read:\n\nWhat I cannot create, I do not understand.\n\nTags: Apple   books   David Goodstein   Feynman’s Lost Lecture   John Gruber   physics   Richard Feynman   science   The Feynman Lectures on Physics",

          "description": "Low mortgage rates unleashed a massive wave of refinancing that was a windfall for millions of consumers, but what will happen once those unusually low mortgage rates are gone? Will refinancing mortgage loans effectively be sidelined as a financial resource for home owners?\n\nWhile the opportunity to lower your interest rate may be the most compelling reason to refinance, it is just one of several. Refinancing can accomplish different things for different people, and the more you are aware of what refinancing can do, the more likely you are to be able to use it to your advantage.\n\n5 compelling reasons to refinance your mortgage\n\nHere are five good reasons to refinance:\n\n1. Reduce interest rates\n\nA drop in market rates can create a compelling opportunity to refinance. However, even if interest rates generally are not lower than those on your current mortgage, you still may be able to lower your rate by refinancing. Rates on shorter mortgages and on adjustable rate mortgages are generally much lower than those on 30-year mortgages.\n\nSo, if you can afford the higher payments that come with a shorter mortgage, you might be able to lower your interest rate by refinancing from a 30-year to a 15-year loan. As for adjustable rate mortgages, the drawback with them is that the rate is subject to vary, so you won’t necessarily be lowering your interest rate for the life of the loan.\n\nHowever, if you only anticipate being in your current home for a few years more, you might be able to benefit from an adjustable rate mortgage without the long-term risk of rate fluctuations.\n\n2. Lower long-term interest expenses\n\nShorter mortgages don’t just carry lower rates. They also mean paying interest for fewer years. Even if conditions are such that you can’t lower your mortgage rate, you might find you could achieve significant long-term savings by switching to a shorter mortgage.\n\n3. Eliminate mortgage insurance premiums\n\nMortgages like loans from the U.S. Federal Housing Administration that allow low down payments also typically require that you pay for mortgage insurance. Once you have built more equity in your home though, you might qualify for a type of loan that does not require mortgage insurance, so that could represent a potential savings if you refinance.\n\n4. Make monthly payments more affordable\n\nStretching your remaining payments out over a longer period can result in reducing those payments. Lengthening your loan is also likely to result in paying more total interest in the long run. But if it is the only way to make your mortgage affordable, this can be a good reason to refinance.\n\n5. Switch from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan\n\nYou may have chosen an adjustable rate mortgage for a variety of reasons, but if you plan on being in your home for the long-term it would reduce your financial risk to stabilize your monthly mortgage payments. You could do this by switching from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan.\n\nWhat you need to refinance\n\nTo take advantage of your refinancing opportunities, it helps to have the following:\n\n1. Equity – and the more the better\n\nWhile government programs temporarily made refinancing available to some home owners with little or no equity in their homes (due to the collapse in home prices following the housing crisis), generally you are going to need a solid amount of equity in your home in order to qualify for refinancing. If you have 20 percent or more, you may be able to qualify for a loan that does not require you to pay mortgage insurance.\n\n2. A good credit score\n\nKeeping your credit healthy means keeping your refinancing options open – and you never know when the right conditions might arise.\n\n3. Steady employment\n\nIf you are thinking of refinancing, you might want to do it before you make a change in jobs. Lenders like applicants who have held their jobs for a long time.\n\n4. Closing costs\n\nClosing costs will probably total at least a couple thousand dollars, and very often much more than that. You can finance this, such as by adding the closing costs to the amount you are borrowing in the new mortgage. But this will be more expensive in the long run and could eat into your equity balance. As noted previously, less equity (or what’s known as a higher loan-to-value ratio) can negatively impact your ability to qualify for refinancing. Or it could result in you paying more in mortgage insurance premiums.\n\nConsider a low interest rate environment as the low-hanging fruit among refinancing scenarios. However, it is not the only worthwhile reason to refinance. Getting the most out of the potential benefits that refinancing presents requires knowing the different things it can accomplish, and being prepared to act on your refinancing opportunities.\n\nGRS is committed to helping our readers save and achieve their financial goals.

          "description": "Even if you get the recommended seven or more hours of sleep on the weekends, you may ruin your week if you pass out at 3am and wake up at 11. Researchers call this social jet lag: even if you get the same number of hours of sleep you’d get on a weeknight, your inconsistent bedtimes may still reduce the quality of your sleep.\n\nThe consequences are worse than just being tired Monday morning. Preliminary research led by a team at the University of Arizona shows a link between social jet lag and health issues like an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nThe research, presented on June 5 at the Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in Boston, was based on a survey of about 1,000 American aged 22 to 60 about their daily sleep, exercise, and eating habits. Over the course of 14 days, participants reported when they typically went to bed at different points during the week, as well as other markers of health like diet, mood, and how tired they felt. They also answered questions about their medical record, including any history of heart disease.\n\nTo measure social jet lag, the research team compared what time people went to sleep and woke up on weekdays and weekends. They found that—assuming people got the same total amount of sleep seven nights a week—every hour later people were going to bed on the weekends correlated with a roughly 11% increase in risk of heart disease. Each hour of social jet lag was also related to how healthy people thought of themselves overall: for every hour participants said they were up later, they were 22% more likely to say that they were in “good” or “fair” instead of “excellent” health.\n\nAlthough these results are self-reported, and therefore less rigorous than a study in which researchers could observe participants first hand, they suggest our bodies prefer consistent sleep. “A regular sleep schedule may be an effective, relatively simple, and inexpensive preventative treatment for heart disease as well as many other health problems,” Sierra Forbush, a student studying sleep at the University of Arizona and lead author of the paper, said in a statement.\n\nForbush told MedPage Today she believes later bedtimes can throw off our circadian clock, the rhythm our bodies keep to produce different hormones when we go to bed or wake up. It’s not clear why this is the case, but it also isn’t the first time researchers have found adverse health effects connected to social jet lag. In 2012, researchers from the University of Munich found that people who stayed up later on the weekends were more likely to be obese, which is a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes. In 2006, a different team also from the University of Munich found (paywall) that people with larger social jet lag also tended to be tobacco smokers.\n\nNotably, this research hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and the researchers conspicuously didn’t ask responders what keeps them up later. Alcohol is a sleep disruptor (paywall) itself, and consistent drinking has been linked to both heart and liver disease, as well as breast and colon cancer.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "America isn’t being made great. It’s being made weak.\n\nOn Friday, January 6, FBI Director James Comey met with President-elect Donald Trump. His task was awkward; he needed to inform Trump that the FBI’s counterterrorism unit was investigating claims that Russia had embarrassing blackmail material on the billionaire real estate developer.\n\nSomething in Trump’s reaction disturbed Comey. “I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo,” he recalls in testimony prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee. The compulsion to record the conversation was fierce and immediate; Comey didn’t even wait to get back to his hotel. “I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting.” From then on, Comey began documenting all his meetings with Trump. “This had not been my practice in the past,” he says.\n\nOn January 27, Comey again found himself in a strange situation with the president, caught by surprise when a dinner invitation that originally included his family turned into Comey having dinner with Trump, alone, in the White House’s Green Room. Trump immediately asked if Comey wanted to remain in his job, and said many other people would want it — a request Comey found strange, as Trump had already asked him to stay on as FBI director, and Comey had already accepted.\n\n“My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship,” Comey says. Trump would soon make that perfectly clear. “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,” the president told his FBI director.\n\nIn subsequent meetings, Trump would ask Comey to “lift the cloud” Russia was casting over his presidency, to announce publicly that Trump was not being investigated, and to squelch the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s activities. In their final conversation, Trump asked for Comey’s cooperation, saying, “I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” Comey says he did not know what “that thing” was. Shortly thereafter, Comey was fired.\n\nComey’s testimony is being parsed for evidence that Trump has obstructed justice, and thereby committed an impeachable offense. Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin thinks the case is open and shut. “Comey's statement establishes obstruction of justice by Trump,” he writes. “Period.”\n\nThat is an important discussion to have, but I want to focus on the bigger, simpler picture. Donald Trump’s presidency has thrown America into crisis.\n\nThere are two levels to this crisis. The first is the crisis of legitimacy at the highest levels of the American government. As Ben Wittes, editor of Lawfare, writes, “Comey is describing here conduct that a society committed to the rule of law simply cannot accept in a president.” He continues:\n\nThis document is about ... whether we can trust the President — not the President in the abstract, but the particular embodiment of the presidency in the person of Donald J. Trump — to supervise the law enforcement apparatus of the United States in fashion consistent with his oath of office. I challenge anyone to read this document and come away with a confidently affirmative answer to that question.\n\nTrump’s behavior, in Comey’s telling, is more befitting of a Mafioso than a president. He asks, repeatedly, for loyalty, and shows no evident understanding of the norms or institutions that bind American presidents. His actions would be worrying if they came from the regional manager of a Scranton paper firm; they are terrifying coming from the most powerful man in the world.\n\nBut the crisis does not end with Comey. This is the 138th day of Donald Trump’s presidency, and what do we have to show for it? No major legislation has passed, nor is any major legislation close to passage. Of Trump’s major priorities, only 8 percent of Americans want the House-passed (and Trump-endorsed) American Health Care Act signed into law, and a majority oppose the White House’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nAmerica’s deepest alliances are fraying, and Trump’s recent visit to Europe left German Chancellor Angela Merkel — a politician known for her understatement, not her overstatement — to say that “the times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over.”\n\nAt the center of all this, Trump is running a chaotic and understaffed government. He has named nominees for only 80 of the 558 key appointments he needs to fill, and only 40 of them have cleared Senate confirmation. Last night brought news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was considering resigning, and last week brought news that Trump’s communications director had been fired. Trump is tweeting out criticisms of his own Justice Department, investigators are digging into first son-in-law Jared Kushner’s contacts with Russia, and chief eldest child Ivanka Trump has wrested the cover of US Weekly for a profile focusing on her disagreements with her father. Amid all this, Trump’s approval rating is down to a miserable 38 percent.\n\nThis isn’t a reality show, and it’s not a pulp novel. This is the most powerful country the world has ever known being run by a man singularly unqualified to run it. Our president lacks legitimacy, our government is paralyzed, our problems are going unsolved. As we abdicate global leadership, both our allies and our enemies step into the void we leave unfilled. Meanwhile, at home, we are discussing whether the president obstructed justice within his first 100 days in office, and anxiously awaiting the Senate’s questioning of former FBI Director Comey.\n\nAmerica is not being made great. It is being made weak, and it is only getting worse.",

          "description": "Just a few years ago, J.Crew seemed invincible. Sales were rocketing, as was the clothing retailer’s cultural cachet.\n\nNow, the brand is watching its sales plunge, and within the last two months, has announced the departures of the very people who engineered its success. In April, Jenna Lyons, the company’s iconic creative lead, left. Then just yesterday (June 5), CEO Mickey Drexler revealed he would be stepping down.\n\nIn recent years, Drexler and his team, including the designers Lyons and Frank Muytjens (who also left in April), have frequently missed the mark. This shakeup is arguably overdue.\n\nBut there’s no denying that together they defined a moment in the way Americans dressed, and that Drexler did what he was hired for, which was restore J.Crew to relevance and make it a financial success. Here’s a look back at the Mickey Drexler era, and a blow-by-blow on the incredible rise and fall of J.Crew:\n\n2003\n\nIn January, J.Crew names Drexler CEO. He joins a team that includes Jenna Lyons, the vice president of women’s design, who has been at the brand since 1990. That year, he buys the Madewell name, which he agrees later to lease to J.Crew for $1 a year.\n\n2004\n\nDrexler hires Frank Muytjens of Ralph Lauren as a men’s designer. Sales are already taking off.\n\n2005\n\nDrexler is widely praised for resuscitating J.Crew. “Mickey Drexler’s Second Coming,” reads one headline from Fortune. J.Crew absorbs the Madewell brand.\n\n2006\n\nJ.Crew has its much-anticipated IPO. It also launches Madewell as its own denim-centric label. Meanwhile, Lyons is drawing fashion-industry recognition for shaping J.Crew’s fresh, fashion-forward take on prep.\n\n2008\n\nSales slow as recession hits the US, but the J.Crew name remains hot. Lyons is named creative director, and Muytjens head men’s designer. He introduces the popular Ludlow Suit that year. Michelle Obama gives the brand a bump by wearing one of its cardigans on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\n2009\n\nUnder Muytjens, J.Crew has by now become a go-to resource for style-conscious American guys who love its slim-fitting workwear.\n\n2010\n\nTwo private-equity firms acquire J.Crew. The Wall Street Journal reports that it is seeing sales soften “amid a lack of fashion hits, discounting by competitors and Mr. Drexler’s efforts to elevate the price of some of the company’s goods to luxury status.” Drexler pointedly resists discounting. Lyons is named president of the brand.\n\n2011\n\nLyons is becoming a fashion celebrity, turning up at events such as the Met Gala. The industry loves the bright colors and splashes of sequins she has introduced across J.Crew’s womenswear. The styling in the company’s beloved catalogues gets more adventurous.\n\n2012\n\nJ.Crew peaks in terms of recent sales growth. By this point, e-commerce is spreading rapidly, fast-fashion competitors are growing in the US, and consumers are showing some reluctance to buy at full-price.\n\n2013\n\nDrexler picks longtime J.Crew designer Somsack Sikhounmuong to lead a turnaround at its flagging Madewell subsidiary.\n\n2014\n\nSales growth is slowing substantially. Mall traffic is dropping, but J.Crew is reluctant to close stores. It’s also known by this point to be frequently offering discounts, and once-loyal customers are finding the brand expensive and out-of-touch with their needs. Meanwhile, the Madewell brand shows strong growth.\n\n2015\n\nFor the first time since 2003, sales shrink for the year. The losses are worst at J.Crew, while Madewell continues to outperform its parent brand. In June, J.Crew fires Tom Mora, its head of women’s design, and elevates Madewell’s Sikhounmuong to the position. At the end of the year, the private-equity firm TPG Capital, one of J.Crew’s owners, substantially cuts its holdings in the company.\n\n2016\n\nAnother year of losses. J.Crew is now frequently discounting to keep selling, hurting margins and its brand image. Investors are concerned about the company’s sizable debt.\n\n2017\n\nIn April, Lyons and Muytjens both part ways with J.Crew. Sikhounmuong takes over as the chief designer of all lines, but J.Crew announces Lyons’s position will not be filled. Then the other shoe drops: In June, Drexler says he will step down as CEO. West Elm president Jim Brett will assume the role in July, beginning a new era for the company.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "There’s a new way to make learning Chinese characters fun for Japanese kids—just add poop.\n\nThe series “Unko kanji drills”—”unko” meaning poop, and “kanji” the word for the Chinese characters used in Japanese writing—has sold almost two million copies since it hit the market in March. The six books in the series each feature a teacher with an emoji-like poop as a head, Unko-sensei, or Mr. Poop, who guides the children in how to write 1,000 characters through 3,018 poop-infused exercises.\n\nThe books (link in Japanese) were created by Shuji Yamamoto, a former Lehman Brothers employee who had already been dabbling in writing and publishing on the side while he was at the bank. He initially founded his own publishing house after he quit Lehman shortly before the bank went under, and mostly published self-help books, including best-sellers. He became interested (link in Japanese) in educational books, but felt that existing teaching materials were too boring—so he teamed up with Yasaku Furuya, a writer of poop-themed senryu, or haiku-like short poems usually about whimsical topics, for his project.\n\nJapanese students are expected to learn 1,000 kanji by the time they leave elementary school. Learning kanji is generally a rote-based drag, and in Japanese the process is complicated by the fact that one character can have multiple pronunciations. As kanji characters were brought over from China, each character has a pronunciation that comes from the original Chinese, known as onyomi, and a Japanese pronunciation, known as kunyomi. For example the character for eat, 食, is pronounced “shoku” in its onyomi form, and “tabe” in its kunyomi form.\n\nIn a drill where Mr. Poop teaches children how to write the character for “wind,” a small drawing shows blobs of poop blowing in the wind, alongside sentences that say, “I held poop and walked through the north wind” and, “A ghastly number of poop is being blown in by the typhoon.”\n\n【風】（小学2年生）1.うんこをがまんして北風の中を歩いた。2.風車を持ってうんこをしているおじいちゃん。3.台風でものすごい数のうんこがとんできた。#うんこ漢字 #うんこ漢字ドリル http://pic.twitter.com/jGTbSbfBF6\n\n— うんこ漢字ドリル (@unkokanji) June 4, 2017\n\nAll six books in the series are currently among the top 20 bestsellers (link in Japanese) on Amazon’s Japanese site. One reviewer wrote, “I gave this book as a gift to my best friend’s son, who dislikes kanji so much it makes him cry. He seems to be starting to do it… It’s great!”\n\nJapanese parents have been sharing photos of their children proudly holding their poop books on social media:\n\n 我が家にうんこ漢字ドリルがやってきた！ネットで購入です。くだらないけど、嫌いじゃない!(^^)!あさひ！結果を出してくれ！#うんこ漢字ドリル\n\nA post shared by yoshihiro Ito (@arigatou.6.2.y.i) on Jun 4, 2017 at 5:11am PDT\n\nIn an interview (link in Japanese) with the Nikkei newspaper, Furuya, the writer of poop poetry, said he believes the word “unko” is beloved by children, but saying it could get them in trouble with teachers and parents. These books give them liberal license to use the word as much as they want. “In other words, I want children to feel liberated when it comes to poop,” he said.",

          "description": "First, it was Jenna Lyons. In April, J.Crew parted ways with the creative director, who, more than anyone, was responsible for creating the look that defined the brand for over a decade.\n\nNow, Mickey Drexler will step down from his position as CEO, a role he’s held since 2003. He will remain on as chairman, and James Brett, the current president of home-furnishings company West Elm, will take over as chief executive in mid-July.\n\nDrexler and Lyons were a formidable duo, tripling J.Crew’s sales from 2003 to 2013. Together they made J.Crew one of America’s most beloved brands, and earned fans including former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThen the magic faded. Sales at stores open for at least a year have been falling for more than two years now. Drexler, speaking to the Wall Street Journal just last month (paywall), said the company had become too “elitist,” giving shoppers the sense that it was a higher-priced brand than it really was. Lyons’s fashion-forward prep had ultimately become too eccentric and expensive for J.Crew’s once-loyal customers. Drexler, for his part, didn’t anticipate how quickly fashion would move in the digital era, and how much price competition there would be from fast fashion.\n\nIn an interview with WWD (paywall), Drexler said it was his decision to step down, and he had been preparing for months. “I am a young, old guy. I have shpilkes,” he said. “I am always in a state of impatience. I have been here for 14 years. I thought it was time to move on and lessen up on the day-to-day. The [succession] plan had been in motion for some time. I told the board a year ago I was ready to step down and move to chairman.”\n\nBrett, Drexler’s successor, was once an executive at Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie, but he’s best known for working a successful turnaround at West Elm, where he sought to bring “personality and soul” back into the design since he became president of the company in 2010. Under his guidance, West Elm’s annual sales increased from around $250 million to about $1 billion, according to financial sources cited by WWD.\n\nDrexler’s 14-year run as J.Crew’s top executive followed his previous job as the CEO at Gap, where he helped revitalize the brand in the 1990s and earned the nickname “merchant prince.” He was and will continue to be widely admired and respected in the retail business.\n\nBrett, meanwhile, will have his work cut out for him once he inherits the many and daunting challenges now faced by J.Crew.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Islamic Travels and Tours is a boutique agency tailored to attend to the complete needs of the Muslim traveler in South Africa. In addition to organizing shark cage dives, whale watches, and bungee jumps, it will plan honeymoons for Muslim couples, arrange visits to a Muslim-owned predator park in Johannesburg, and schedule tours of South Africa’s first mosque, built in Cape Town in 1794.\n\nIt will arrange tours of Soweto and trips on safari, and leave room on its clients’ itineraries for ritual prayer and dinners adhering to religious dietary laws. It will even match clients with local host families who share their religious background, giving tourists a chance, Islamic Travels owner Khalid Vawda says, to solidify their experience of South Africa and “see what life is like [for] an average Muslim working family.”\n\nWhat you won’t find advertised on Islamic Travels’ website: excursions to vineyards, casinos, and nightclubs—staples of typical South African tour operators, but not activities that many Muslims would care to be associated with.\n\nVawda, a practicing Muslim from Johannesburg and an intrepid traveler himself, started his business in 2015 after realizing that traditional travel firms were overlooking a big opportunity. “Halal tourism,” as the growing niche is known, is being driven by a rising Muslim middle-class population that is well-educated, with disposable income and access to travel information. An estimated 117 million Muslims traveled internationally in 2015, according to the 2016 MasterCard-Crescent Rating Global Muslim Travel Index. That number is expected to grow to 168 million by 2020, with travel expenditures exceeding $200 billion.\n\nBut where some businesses see opportunity, others see danger. Donald Trump’s attempts to turn away visitors to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries, and to ban laptops aboard flights from several North African and Middle East countries, threatens to cut the US off from a growing opportunity to court Muslim tourism dollars, even from people who don’t live in countries the travel restrictions would cover. In February, the head of the World Travel & Tourism Council told the Boston Globe that the loss could be on par with the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue he estimates was lost in the decade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks because of “strict visa policies and inward-looking sentiment.”\n\nAs Muslim travelers explore more welcoming destinations, Africa stands to benefit.\n\nA Berber salesman sells Berber artifacts in a shop in Marrakesh in western Morocco. (Quartz/Nushmia Khan)\n\nIn Africa, Muslims mainly prefer to visit countries in North Africa like Morocco and Egypt, which have Islamic traditions, institutions, and cultural artifacts. Both countries are members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), an intergovernmental collective of 57 Muslim nations on four continents. But even Muslim-minority countries like Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania are positioning themselves as places of halal tourism.\n\nIn Kenya, where tourism plays an important role in generating employment and foreign-exchange earnings, tourism officials plan to roll out standards by 2018 for certifying hotels and restaurants that meet halal standards to cater to Muslim tourists. Its cabinet secretary for tourism, Najib Balala, has suggested hiring Muslim-travel brand ambassadors and that Kenya join the OIC as an “observer” nation to better market itself to Muslims.\n\nThe most popular destinations for Muslims today include the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Turkey, and Jordan, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Lebanon, Iran, and Bahrain also attract many visitors. In the non-Muslim world, halal tourism is heading to places like Singapore, Thailand, Japan, and the United Kingdom—some of which have adopted Muslim visitor-friendly policies. Mastercard’s Muslim travel index shows that many countries outside of the OIC are moving up the ranking at a faster pace than their Muslim counterparts, reflecting faster growth in Muslim tourism.\n\nSouth Africa has positioned itself as a regional hub for Islamic investment and travel, despite less than 2% of its population being Muslim. The country is one of the top five non-IOC countries most visited by Muslim travelers.\n\nLocal platforms like Stay Halaal offer travelers accommodation, sight-seeing activities, and food options. Local outlets of major international franchises like McDonald’s and Burger King are in many cases halal-certified. The Cape Town chapter of the nation’s hospitality association is working with Crescent Rating, a halal accreditation service, to audit the city’s facilities and run workshops to help businesses attract Muslim travelers.\n\nThe Auwal Mosque in Cape Town was built in 1794 and was the first mosque in South Africa. (Quartz/Nushmia Khan)\n\nVawda says that steps by the local hospitality industry to accommodate travelers from different cultures have helped to boost his country’s image with travelers globally. South Africa’s major cities—Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban—remain the most visited cities in Africa, according to the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, and the country boasts the most hotels in sub-Saharan Africa. A diversity of services means clients are able to “shoot for any budget” for their travel, Vawda says, whether they are coming from Malaysia, Singapore, India, or the US.\n\nThe tourism sector in other African countries isn’t as developed. To meet the growing need, investors are looking at markets that have potential to develop halal-friendly hotels. Chris Nader is the vice president for development for Shaza Hotels, an independent five-star hotel management company based in the UAE. The company helps manage halal-friendly properties on behalf of investors and owners. After developing hotels all across the Middle East, Nader says the company is shifting focus toward expanding the brand in southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\n“We know that there are investors in these markets who are keen to own a hotel,” Nader says. One opportunity is to develop halal-compliant lodges in popular safari destinations across Africa, he says.\n\nAccessing halal food is an important part of the experience in the halal travel industry. (Quartz/Nushmia Khan)\n\nThis month, a startup called Muzbnb plans to launch an Airbnb-like service to let Muslim proprietors rent to Muslim travelers around the world. The platform would provide travelers with guidance on properties with a prayer space or proximity to a mosque, and have recommendations for nearby halal dining options. Co-founder and CEO Hadi Shakur hopes to enrich the experiences of Muslim travelers and to have them feel treated not “as a liability, but rather as an asset.”\n\nMuzbnb says it has received listing requests from several African countries including Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Tunisia, Tanzania, and South Africa.\n\nOvercoming challenges\n\nBefore it becomes more profitable in Africa, the halal tourism business has to overcome some challenges. The cost of obtaining certification, restructuring facilities, and training employees and chefs on how to attend to Muslim guests can be prohibitive to hotel operators and service providers. Local hospitality sectors also face losing revenue from alcohol sales.\n\nWhat constitutes “halal” is subjective; there are no unified, global halal standards. Without established guidelines and proof of strict compliance, orthodox travelers could be put off.\n\n“Halal certification is not just about the product, but about the process,” says Anna Maria Aisha Tiozzo, president of the World Halal Development certification center in Italy. For instance, hotels have to be careful not only in how they prepare food as prescribed by Muslim law but in where they source their meat or other ingredients, Tiozzo says. Without uniform standards, it will be hard for different regulators in different nations to follow the certification criteria, let alone supervise how businesses conduct their operations in their respective cities and countries.\n\nThe entrance of the mausoleum of Moulay Idris II in the city of Fes in Morocco. Moulay Idris II founded Fes in 810 and was a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. (Quartz/Nushmia Khan)\n\nAnother key challenge is the looming threat of terrorism, which has battered tourism markets in Tunisia, Egypt, and Kenya.\n\nBut the even bigger obstacle for halal tourism providers in Sub-Saharan Africa is obtaining financing and convincing investors that the market is ready. Nader says that most investors interested in financing halal tourism want to “put their money in already saturated markets” in the Middle East or North Africa. This, he says, creates “difficulties in bridging the gap between statistics, demand, and people who have the money that can invest.”\n\nTo overcome the cash shortage, governments might look into the Islamic finance industry for investment. Islamic finance, which operates on a profit-sharing basis rather than collecting interest, or usury, has proven to be an effective tool to raise capital globally and finance development projects, according to the World Bank. Sub-Saharan Africa countries like Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo have all tapped into Islamic finance, with some even offering sukuk or Islamic bonds.\n\nIf Islamic Travels’ early success is any indication, there’s money to be made in halal tourism in Africa. Vawda says his company has been profitable for the two years it’s been in operation, and is getting more and more calls from travelers and agents overseas.\n\n“The business is still in its infancy,” Vawda says, “but the potential is immense.”\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Photos by Claire Lower unless otherwise noted.\n\nIf you have recently purchased an immersion circulator—or are looking to—deciding what to cook first with your new toy can be a little overwhelming. Luckily, we do a fair amount of sous vide-ing around these parts and have a pretty good handle on what will sous vide and what won’t.\n\nDry turkey and overcooked steaks don't have to be a staple of your holiday dinners or homemade …\n\nRead more\n\nIf you’re completely new to the cooking method, I suggest checking out our primer on the subject, which will explain how it all works, as well as the pros and cons of this increasingly popular culinary hot tub. Once you have a grasp on what sous-vide cooking is all about, you’re ready to cook, and we have many delicious suggestions.\n\nMeats That Dry Out or Overcook Easily\n\nSous-vide cooking lets you control the final temperature of your food exactly, making overcooked food virtually extinct. Unlike cooking food in the oven or grill—which heats foods much higher than their target temperatures—leaving your steak in a sous-vide bath an extra 1o minutes or so isn’t going to take it from medium-rare to well-done. It’s also an extremely moist cooking environment, as nothing is going to evaporate from a vacuum-sealed bag—meaning dry, drab pork chops are a thing of yesteryear.\n\nBest of all, it’s super easy. Just pick your target temperature, seal your meat in a bag, and set it in the bath. Set a timer and, once your meat is cooked to your desired “doneness,” pull it out, pat it off with paper towels, and give it a hot sear. ChefSteps has an extensive time and temperature chart that includes almost any protein you could imagine, but these are a few of my favorites.\n\nSteak: Season a rib eye with salt and then sous vide at 130℉ for an hour. Give it a sear in a scorching hot pan to get a crust. (I like duck fat, but butter will give you more browned bits more quickly.)\n\nDuck breasts: Season duck breasts with salt, seal them up in their bags, and put them in the bath for two hours at 130℉. Carefully remove the skin from the breast, then fry it on both sides, pressing it down with a metal spatula to keep it as flat as possible. Slice the breast meat and top with the super crispy skin.\n\nPork Chops: I had these just last night, and they are a fave for sure. One hour at 140℉, followed by a quick sear in butter, will result in the juiciest pork chop of your life.\n\nTurkey and Chicken Breasts: I like 140℉ for an hour and a half for chicken, 149℉ for 3 hours for turkey. (Season the meat well, and throw in some extra fat and aromatics for the most flavorful white-meat poultry of your life.)\n\nSeafood: Anova has a whole bunch of great recipes for all sorts of sous-vide sea creatures, but you’ll probably want to start with either lobster or tuna.\n\nThere are a lot of options, as you can plainly see.\n\nMeats With Lots of Connective Tissue\n\nAnything with a lot of collagen benefits from being cooked low and slow in a very moist cooking environment, and you immersion circulator is the perfect tool for executing this. Just make sure to use special sous-vide or vacuum bags—Ziploc bags can fall apart at temperatures over 150℉—and cover your tub with either a lid, a bit of plastic wrap, or some packing bubbles to prevent evaporation. Some of my succulent favorites from this category include:\n\nChicken feet: Give the feet a brutal pedicure (cut off the toenails) and then toss them in a bag with your favorite marinade. Let everyone hang out for 24 hours at 180℉, then take ‘em out, dry ‘em off, and deep-fry them.\n\nOxtail: Give it a sear, smother it in seasonings, then let it hang out for 24 hours in a 185-degree bath for the juiciest, most mouth-coating meat ever.\n\nBeef tongue: You could season it before submerging it the bath, but you don’t really have to. I’ve cooked a whole tongue, still in its original vacuum-sealed packaging, with much success. All it really needs is 24 hours at 170℉. Peel off the membrane, shred the meat, fill tacos.\n\nOf course other, more traditional meats benefit from an extended stay in our culinary hot tub, as well. For most tough cuts of beef, 24 hours at 149℉ will treat you just fine, while six hours at 140℉ will give you a perfectly cooked medium-rare roast with little to no trouble at all.\n\nEggs\n\nWith the exception of fried, you can use your immersion circulator to prepare almost any type of egg. Not all applications are totally worth dragging out the water bath, but these are:\n\nScrambled: These aren’t your normal scrambled eggs. Not only do they have much, much smaller curds than those scrambled in a pan, they’re creamier—almost like a custard—and are best served in a bowl. You can also cook a whole bunch at once. When placed in a 167-degree bath, a three-egg batch takes 15 minutes, a six-egg batch takes 30, a dozen eggs will take 40, and two-dozen will be done in 50 minutes.\n\nPasteurized: Want to make perfectly safe raw cookie dough? Or perhaps you have young children who are prone to experiment with raw eggs? Either way, you probably want to pasteurize them (without cooking)—and this is very easy to do. Just put the eggs (no plastic bag needed) in a 135-degree bath for 75 minutes, take them out, and use them however you see fit.\n\nPoached: Last Easter, I prepared perfect eggs Benedict for a crowd of 15—a feat that would not have been possible without my Anova. This recipe from ChefSteps can tell you how to pull off the entire dish, but all you’ll need to do with the eggs is set your circulator at 147℉, then let them hang out in the bath for about an hour.\n\nTrust me, this cooking method really is all it’s cracked up to be.\n\nCertain Vegetables\n\nOkay, there are honestly only two vegetables I bother cooking sous-vide, but they’re really, really good.\n\nCarrots: I was skeptical at first, but Kenji over at Serious Eats convinced me to try these intensely carrot-y carrots (cooked at 183°F for an hour) and I must admit I was wowed.\n\nAsparagus: Cooking these tasty spears at 185°F for 12 minutes results in perfectly tender-crisp asparagus every single time.\n\nOkay cool, let’s talk about desserts now.\n\nCustardy Desserts\n\nAnything that does well in a bain-marie is going to do well when cooked sous-vide, because they’re basically the same thing (and that thing is a water bath). This means that any type of custard-based treat is a good idea here, and these are some especially great ones.\n\nPumpkin pie: Set your circulator to 176°F, and divide your spicy pie filling among little jars. Set them down in the bath, and let them cook for an hour and a half. Take them out of the bath, removing the lids so condensation doesn’t form as they’re cooling, then transfer to the fridge to chill for at least four hours. Top with whipped cream before devouring.\n\nCheesecake: I honestly refuse to cook cheesecake any other way. These rich little pots of wonder are cooked exactly the same as the pumpkin pies, only for two hours instead of one and a half, and they are amazing. Not only is sous-vide cheesecake the silkiest, creamiest cheesecake you’ll ever put in your mouth, but it also comes in little single-serving jars, which is fun.\n\nCreme Brulee: I’ve thought about coming up with my own method for this, but there’s no point. The boys at ChefSteps have perfected the sous-vide creme brulee, and you should just make theirs.\n\nHopefully all of that will keep you occupied (and well-fed) for a bit. If not, you can always sous vide a Hot Pocket. It will honestly be the best Hot Pocket you’ve ever had.\n",

          "description": "Walmart, which is aggressively investing in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon, is unveiling a new strategy: turning its army of 1.5 million US employees into delivery drivers.\n\nThe tactic is being tested at three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas, and designed to shave costs out of the “last mile” of distribution, the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. The initiative was announced today (June 1) at Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and in a blog post by Marc Lore, who heads e-commerce operations for Walmart. Lore is the former CEO of e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired last year by Walmart for $3.5 billion to take on Amazon.\n\nUnder the initiative, store employees will be given the option to deliver packages on their way home after work, in exchange for extra pay. They’ll be given an app that allows them to input their routes, and an algorithm will plot the most efficient path. To take part, the employees will have to pass a background and vehicle check. In the pilot, most merchandise was delivered the day after the order was placed, beating Walmart’s pledge of second-day delivery.\n\nWalmart’s digital strategy relies on leveraging its enormous investments in infrastructure and employees. The company has 4,700 US stores and 6,100 trucks, and it hopes to be able to use those assets to narrow the gap with Amazon. Walmart is rolling out a grocery pick-up service, where online orders are delivered to customers’ cars, and is testing other ways of combining online shopping with its physical stores.\n\nWalmart’s online deliveries are now shipped from its warehouses to online fulfillment centers, then taken to customers by couriers like UPS and FedEx, sometimes hundreds of miles. Under the new plan, e-commerce goods would be shipped by Walmart’s fleet of trucks to stores, then the last mile by employees. If there aren’t enough employees available, Walmart will use normal couriers.\n\nBy deputizing its associates as delivery drivers, Walmart may be signaling the end of its experiment of using Lyft and Uber drivers as couriers. “This is very different from crowd-sourced delivery,” Lore said in Bentonville. “It pulls out a tremendous amount of time from that last mile, which pulls out a tremendous amount of cost.”\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Good morning,\n\nIt was great to meet so many of you over the past few days. If I missed anyone, my apologies!\n\nOn to the update:\n\nFaceless Publishers, Take 2\n\nI feel like yesterday’s column, Faceless Publishers, was a bit of a miss, primarily to a lack of clarity on my part.\n\nLet me start by explaining what Faceless Publishers are not:\n\nMedium — This is probably the question I got the most: didn’t Medium seek to be a faceless publisher? The answer, because it’s Medium, is complicated. As far as I can tell, Medium has had three distinct “strategies”:\n\nI believe that Medium’s original goal, as laid out in this 2015 Daily Update, was to be a destination site populated by the long tail of online publishing. Being a destination site with a feed would lend itself to inline advertising; as should be obvious, being a destination site is the exact opposite of being a faceless publisher.\n\nIn 2016, Medium announced Medium for Publishers, which actually looks a lot like what I proposed yesterday. From the Daily Update in which I wrote about the announcement:\n\nAll publishers have basic needs when it comes to infrastructure: except for a few exceptions (that may not be exceptions), no text-based site is differentiated by its content management system, just like no web service is differentiated by its data center, just like no commerce site is differentiated by its payment processor, and just like no startup is differentiated by its office space. In other words, what Medium is offering to all publishers from the one-person blog to the biggest magazines is very much in the same vein as AWS, Stripe, or WeWork: by leveraging scale we can take care of the infrastructure of your business better than you can on your own, and you can spend your time focusing on what differentiates your business.\n\nThis wasn’t the full extent of yesterday’s idea — I think a faceless publisher should handle not only the tech and monetization platform but also some scalable business operations — but it’s pretty far down the road, and it was because of this goal that sites like The Ringer and many others signed up for Medium’s platform.\n\nUnfortunately, as far as I can tell on the outside, Medium did some work on the tech stack but basically nothing on the monetization platform; there was a half-hearted effort to sell some promoted stories and a beta of an individual site membership program, but nothing substantial came of either.\n\nFinally, earlier this year, Medium laid off 50 employees who mostly worked in the “sales, support, and other business functions” part of the company, shuttered its promoted stories product, and 404’d its individual site membership program. By all accounts most of the sites that had moved to Medium under the promises of Plan 2 had little to no warning, and were instead treated to Ev Williams’ declaration that ad-supported media was a “broken system”. A few months later, Williams announced the Medium membership model, in which readers subscribed to Medium for what I called the “Medium Newspaper”.\n\nThis current strategy is in direct opposition to that of a faceless publisher: Medium wants to own the consumer relationship with a strong brand that commoditizes writers, which I think is precisely backwards. I believe that writers and small publications should and will own the consumer relationship, and be supported by a scalable publisher that operates as a service, not an owner.\n\nFederated Media — Federated Media had the business model right; founded in 2005, Federated Media was basically an ad network for online publishers that sold at scale kept a percentage of revenue. The problem is that back then it was far easier for individual sites to monetize on their own, which meant that if a site like TechCrunch or GigaOm became large, it was more profitable to simply sell ads themselves (or use other ad networks); that is no longer an issue today, because the reality of digital advertising is that it is far more difficult for a single site to monetize efficiently. Federated Media was arguably a business that was simply 10 years too early.\n\nThat said, even if Federated Media had succeeded, it was still not a faceless publisher — it was an ad network. Sites were still responsible for their own tech stack and business operations.\n\nLee Enterprises — Lee Enterprises (you could easily substitute in another large newspaper publishers) owns 54 daily newspapers, for which it provides online services, ad sales, some content, etc. It actually is, in function, what I think a faceless publisher should be. The difference is twofold: first, Lee Enterprises is built around print newspapers, with all of the limitations both financially and especially culturally that entails; second, Lee Enterprises owns all of the publications it services, which limits its scale. In other words, I think it has the wrong business model.\n\nSo what is a faceless publisher? It is a service company that provides all of the functionality but for the content necessary to build an online publication, and sells it as a service (likely as a percentage of revenue). The actual publications and associated audiences are built and earned by writers and journalists free to focus on what they do best. Several of you picked up on what is probably the best analogy: e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Square, or even Amazon Merchant Services.\n\nThat gets to my final point: while I used Vox’s deal with The Ringer as a jumping-off point, I am most excited about this model in the context of the sort of subscription-based sites that I wrote about in The Local News Business Model.\n\nMore broadly, I think the Internet will reshape the kinds of businesses that make sense: instead of vertical business built around distribution, businesses with high fixed costs and low marginal costs (like faceless publishers) will be services on which high variable cost business like content publications are built. It is already happening in e-commerce, in cloud services, and I think publishing will be next.\n\nInternet Trends 2017\n\nMary Meeker outdid herself at this year’s Code Conference, delivering 355 slides on 2017’s Internet Trends. As I do every year, I picked out my favorites:\n\nRemember the old adage that print dollars are being replaced by digital dimes and mobile pennies?\n\nIt turns out that a lot of mobile pennies are worth more than some lesser number of digital dimes, which themselves are worth more than even fewer print dollars.\n\nTwo other interesting notes on this slide, which is always one of my favorites: first, while mobile is only 21% of spend compared to 28% of attention, last year it was only 12% of spend compared to 25% of attention; it’s growing fast. Second, while TV time share decreased last year, it was up this past year (while advertising share continued to fall); I suspect that is the Netflix effect (Netflix, of course, has no ads).\n\nI wrote about Facebook and Google’s (then-impending) dominance in The Reality of Missing Out; the sheer dominance of the two companies in digital advertising is arguably one of the biggest factors impacting tech startups since the creation of AWS. There really isn’t room for anyone else.\n\nAs a thought experiment, imagine someone told you in 1995 (for reference, the Playstation launched at the end of 1994) that the number of gamers would increase 2600% in 21 years (while the world population would only increase 30%). You wouldn’t have believed it, right?\n\nThe problem is that in 1995 you probably didn’t imagine the smartphone revolution, which is the clear prerequisite to this level of growth. That’s understandable, but it should also be a reminder of how easy it is to underestimate the future because of the mind’s propensity to assume the world is static. It’s not.\n\nThis, even more than cord-cutting, is the true bear case for sports leagues and TV networks (and, as I noted in The Sports Linchpin, much of the post-war economy). And it’s why Twitch may prove to be Amazon’s most YouTube-esque acquisition.\n\nAh yes, there’s the Netflix Effect.\n\nTencent — thanks to WeChat — is dominant in China (most of the non-WeChat apps, except for QQ, flow from WeChat).\n\nYou can’t understand the China mobile scene (including Tencent’s top and bottom-line growth) without understanding gaming; by extension, given that most of those China dollars flow through App Stores, Apple’s WeChat Problem goes deeper than simply hardware sales.\n\nThis is why India is the most important country for long-term growth:\n\nThis one probably comes as a shock to many of you: people trust Google with their data more than anyone, including Apple.\n\nThings are getting better.\n\nThe Daily Update is intended for a single recipient, but occasional forwarding is totally fine! If you would like to order multiple subscriptions for your team with a group discount (minimum 5), please contact me directly.\n\nThanks for being a supporter, and have a great day!",

          "description": "A decade ago, J.Crew was a defining force in the way Americans dressed. In 2008, its colorful, unfussy prep reached a milestone, when Michelle Obama wore one of the brand’s yellow cardigans on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That cardigan signified accessibility. Everyone could—and did—wear J.Crew, up to and including the first lady of the United States.\n\nJ.Crew has since fallen dramatically from that position. For more than two years now, sales at stores open at least a year have been dropping. Its image has changed too. Once accessible, J.Crew now believes it has become too “elitist,” as CEO Mickey Drexler framed it in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal (paywall).\n\nAs J.Crew does all it can to stabilize its business—some analysts fear that it won’t be able to pay off its $2 billion of debt—it’s working to counter the problem by lowering prices and changing the way it markets itself. It’s already slashing price tags on around 300 items, and using data analytics to determine the best prices for its offerings.\n\nThe retailer also wants to return to being the brand for everyone it once was. The general feeling among former fans is that it got too eccentric in its product and image, especially the styling of its beloved catalogs. The blame is usually put on former creative director Jenna Lyons, who guided the brand’s ascendance, but kept pushing it toward more fashion-forward territory. Shoppers complained that prices got too high, climbing to hundreds of dollars for an item such as a cashmere skirt, and the cool, creative look didn’t match their ordinary lifestyles.\n\n“We gave a perception of being a higher-priced company than we were—in our catalog, online and in our general presentation,” Drexler told the Journal. “Very big mistake.” In April, J.Crew shook up its organization, parting ways with Lyons and cutting about 250 jobs, primarily from its headquarters.\n\nIt’s also looking to cheaper sourcing options than China and trying to speed up how quickly it can get products into stores. Quicker, cheaper fast-fashion competitors have dominated the market for several years, and J.Crew admits it didn’t foresee how much speed and price would influence what shoppers did—and didn’t—buy.\n\nAccessibility, in both look and price, is J.Crew’s goal now, as it tries to convince people to return to it for their clothes, and without waiting for one of the sales J.Crew seems to have perpetually going on. It won’t be easy. Shoppers expect everything cheaper than ever, and J.Crew faces tough competition from fast fashion.\n\nThings have changed a lot since that yellow cardigan.\n\nMost Popular\n",

But during his first overseas trip as president, Trump seems to be losing at his own game.\n\nWhen Trump met Emmanuel Macron today in Brussels, the newly elected French president grabbed his hand hard—and wouldn’t let go before Trump did. Press images show Trump leaning away and attempting twice to free himself from Macron’s death grip. His neck appears stiff and his lips pressed to a thin line.\n\nReuters notes:\n\nEach man gripped each other’s right hand so firmly that their knuckles turned white and their jaws seemed to clench.\n\nImages from the photo session at the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Brussels showed Trump finally giving up, his fingers loosened while Macron is still holding on tightly.\n\nUpdate: Later footage from the same day suggests that Trump might be trying to make up for his lack of home team advantage. During a group photo with NATO leaders following his meeting with Macron, Trump exacted revenge with an extremely vigorous second shake.\n\nThis is a pretty intense handshake between Macron and Trump http://pic.twitter.com/nseTdcpXkX\n\n— Colin Jones (@colinjones) May 25, 2017\n\nJust a few days earlier (May 22) during the Muslim Leaders Summer in Riyadh, the president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, yanked Trump’s hand so hard that the US president was pulled forward—exactly the same way Trump once shook hands with US Supreme Court judge Neil Gorsuch.\n\nНайден человек, который переиграл Трампа в рукопожатии http://pic.twitter.com/snhfDgJr2r\n\n— тем временем… (@a_imanaliev) May 23, 2017\n",

This means there's a good chance you might encounter someone — a friend, a co-worker, the barista making your latte at Starbucks, your child's teacher — who is celebrating Ramadan.\n\nBut what is Ramadan, exactly? And how can I make sure I don't accidentally offend my Muslim friends and acquaintances during Ramadan?\n\nWe've got you covered: Here are the most basic answers to the most basic questions about Ramadan.\n\n1) What is Ramadan actually about?\n\nRamadan is the most sacred month of the year for Muslims — the Prophet Mohammed reportedly said, \"When the month of Ramadan starts, the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are chained.\"\n\nMuslims believe it was during this month that God revealed the first verses of the Quran, Islam's sacred text, to Mohammed, on a night known as \"The Night of Power\" (or Laylat al-Qadr in Arabic).\n\nDuring the entire month of Ramadan, Muslims fast every day from sunrise to sunset. It is meant to be a time of spiritual discipline — of deep contemplation of one's relationship with God, extra prayer, increased charity and generosity, and intense study of the Quran.\n\nBut if that makes it sound super serious and boring, it's really not. It's a time of celebration and joy, to be spent with loved ones. At the end of Ramadan there is a big three-day celebration called Eid al-Fitr, or \"the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast.\" It's kind of like the Muslim version of Christmas, in the sense that it's a religious holiday where everyone comes together for big meals with family and friends, exchanges presents, and generally has a lovely time.\n\n Eid presents!!! Cem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nDespite the hardship of fasting for a whole month, most Muslims (myself included) actually look forward to Ramadan and are a little sad when it's over. There's just something really special about knowing that tens of millions of your fellow Muslims around the world are experiencing the same hunger pangs, dry mouth, and dizzy spells that you are, and that we're all in it together.\n\n2) How does fasting work?\n\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars — or duties — of Islam, along with the testimony of faith, prayer, charitable giving, and making pilgrimage to Mecca. All Muslims are required to take part every year, though there are special dispensations for those who are ill, pregnant or nursing, menstruating, or traveling, and for young children and the elderly.\n\nThe practice of fasting serves several spiritual and social purposes: to remind you of your human frailty and your dependence on God for sustenance, to show you what it feels like to be hungry and thirsty so you feel compassion for (and a duty to help) the poor and needy, and to reduce the distractions in life so you can more clearly focus on your relationship with God.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating any food, drinking any liquids, smoking cigarettes, and engaging in any sexual activity, from sunrise to sunset. That includes taking medication (even if you swallow a pill dry, without drinking any water). Chewing gum is also prohibited (though I didn't find that one out until about halfway through my first Ramadan after converting — oops).\n\nDoing any of those things \"invalidates\" your fast for the day, and you just start over the next day. To make up for days you didn't fast, you can either fast later in the year (either all at once or a day here and there) or provide a meal to a needy person for each day you missed.\n\nMuslims are also supposed to try to curb negative thoughts and emotions like jealousy and anger, and even lesser things like swearing, complaining, and gossiping, during the month. Some people may also choose to give up or limit activities like listening to music and watching television, often in favor of listening to recitations of the Quran.\n\n3) What is a typical day like during Ramadan?\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims wake up well before dawn to eat the first meal of the day, which has to last until sunset. This means eating lots of high-protein foods and drinking as much water as possible right up until dawn, after which you can't eat or drink anything. At dawn, we perform the morning prayer. Since it's usually still pretty early, many go back to sleep for a bit before waking up again to get ready for the day (I certainly do).\n\nMuslims are not supposed to avoid work or school or any other normal duties during the day just because we are fasting. In many Muslim countries, however, businesses and schools may reduce their hours during the day or close entirely. For the most part, though, Muslims go about their daily business as we normally would, despite not being able to eat or drink anything the whole day.\n\nWhen the evening call to prayer is finally made (or when the alarm on your phone's Muslim prayer app goes off), we break the day's fast with a light meal — really more of a snack — called an iftar (literally \"breakfast\"), before performing the evening prayer. Many also go to the mosque for the evening prayer, followed by a special prayer that is only recited during Ramadan.\n\nThis is usually followed by a larger meal a bit later in the evening, which is often shared with family and friends in one another's homes throughout the month. Then it's off to bed for a few hours of sleep before it's time to wake up and start all over again.\n\n(Note: There are good reasons for only having a small snack to break your fast before performing the evening prayer and then eating a bigger meal later. Muslim prayers involve a lot of movement — bending over, prostrating on the ground, standing up, etc. Doing all that physical activity on a full stomach after not having eaten for 15 hours is a recipe for disaster. Just trust me on this one.)\n\n4) So do you lose weight during Ramadan?\n\nSome of you may be thinking, \"Wow, that sounds like a great way to lose weight! I'm going to try it!\" But in fact, Ramadan is actually notorious for often causing weight gain. That's because eating large meals super early in the morning and late at night with a long period of low activity bordering on lethargy in between can wreak havoc on your metabolism.\n\nBut if you're careful, you can avoid putting on weight, and you may actually lose a few pounds. One meta-analysis of scientific studies on the effects of Ramadan fasting on body weight found that \"[w]eight changes during Ramadan were relatively small and mostly reversed after Ramadan, gradually returning to pre-Ramadan status. Ramadan provides an opportunity to lose weight, but structured and consistent lifestyle modifications are necessary to achieve lasting weight loss.\" [Italics mine.]\n\nSo just like with any other extreme diet plan, you may lose a few pounds, but unless you actually make \"structured and consistent lifestyle modifications,\" you're probably not going to see major, lasting results.\n\n5) Why do the dates of Ramadan change every year?\n\nFor religious matters, Muslims follow a lunar calendar — that is, one based on the phases of the moon — whose 12 months add up to approximately 354 days. That's 11 days shorter than the 365 days of the standard Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the Islamic lunar calendar moves backward approximately 11 days each year in relation to the regular Gregorian calendar.\n\nSo that means that the first day of the month of Ramadan, which is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, moves backward by about 11 days each year.\n\nThis has a large impact on how people experience Ramadan from year to year. When Ramadan falls in the winter, it's much easier to fast: the days are shorter, which means you don't have to fast as long, and it's colder out, so not being able to drink water all day isn't as big of a deal, because you're not sweating as much.\n\nConversely, when Ramadan falls in the summer (as it has every year since I converted, because of course), fasting can be brutal. In many Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, summer temperatures can reach levels usually reserved for the deepest bowels of hell.\n\nAnd in some northern European countries such as Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (where, yes, there are Muslims), fasting can last an average of 20 hours or more in the summer. (And in a few places above the Arctic Circle, the sun never actually sets in the summer. In these cases, Muslim religious authorities have decreed that Muslims can either fast along with the closest Muslim country or fast along with Mecca, Saudi Arabia.)\n\n6) Okay, but why is there always confusion every year about exactly what day Ramadan starts on?\n\nThere's a reason \"Ramadan start date\" is one of the most-searched phrases right now. That's because Muslims around the world do not know when exactly Ramadan is actually supposed to start. If you Google it, you'll see there's a little disclaimer under Google's answer that says \"Dates may vary\":\n\n \"Dates may vary.\" Thanks, that's super helpful.\n\nThat also has to do with the moon — as well as disagreements about science, history, and tradition, plus a bit of geopolitical rivalry.\n\nThe beginning of each new month in the Islamic calendar starts on the new moon. Which means the month of Ramadan starts on the new moon. Simple enough, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIf it's been a while since your high school astronomy class, here's a reminder of what the phases of the moon look like:\n\n Pictured: the source of much consternation and hilarity every single Ramadan. Griffith Observatory\n\nBack in Mohammed's day, in sixth-century Arabia, astronomical calculations weren't as precise as they are today, so people went by what they could see with the naked eye.\n\nSince the new moon isn't actually super visible in the night sky (as you can see above), Muslims traditionally waited to start fasting until the small sliver of crescent moon became visible. There's even a saying attributed to the Prophet Mohammed about waiting to start the fast until you see the crescent. (Some people think this is why the star and crescent is the symbol of Islam, but the crescent was used as a symbol long before Islam.)\n\nThis method was a bit messy, though, since things like clouds or just the difficulty of spotting the moon in some locations often led to different groups starting their fast on separate days, even within the same country. Each community, village, or even mosque within the village might send its own guy out to look for the crescent, with rival groups arguing over whether the other guy really saw it or not.\n\nToday, however, we have precise scientific calculations that tell us exactly when the new moon begins, and we don't need to wait until someone spots a tiny crescent in the sky. (In fact, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, \"The need to determine the precise appearance of the hilal [crescent moon] was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy.\")\n\nSo, problem solved! Except that some Muslim scholars believe we should still wait until the slight crescent moon is visible in the night sky, because that's what Mohammed said to do and that's the way we've always done it.\n\nOthers argue that Islam has a strong tradition of reason, knowledge, and science, and that if Mohammed were around today he'd choose the more precise scientific calculations over sending the guy at the mosque with the best eyesight outside to squint at the night sky.\n\nTo make things even more fun, some argue that the whole world should just follow the official moon-sighting decrees of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the location of its holiest sites. But not everyone thinks that's such a swell idea — especially rival countries like Pakistan and Iran, which balk at the idea of treating Saudi Arabia as the ultimate authority on anything having to do with Islam.\n\nAll this means that each year Muslims around the world get to experience the delightful lunacy of \"moon-sighting fighting.\" Indeed, it's such a familiar feature of Ramadan that there are memes about it:\n\n Yes, Muslims use this meme too. There's really no escaping it.\n\n7) Are there differences between how Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims observe Ramadan?\n\nFor the most part, no. Both Sunni and Shia Muslims fast during Ramadan. But there are some minor differences — for instance, Sunnis break their daily fast at sunset, when the sun is no longer visible on the horizon (but there's still light in the sky), whereas Shia wait until the redness of the setting sun has completely vanished and the sky is totally dark.\n\nShia also celebrate an additional holiday within the month of Ramadan that Sunnis do not. For three days — the 19th, 20th, and 21st days of Ramadan — Shia commemorate the martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed who was both the revered fourth caliph of Sunni Islam and the first \"legitimate\" imam (leader) of Shia Islam.\n\nAli was assassinated in the fierce civil wars that erupted following the death of Mohammed over who should lead the Muslim community in his stead. On the 19th day of the month of Ramadan, while Ali was worshipping at a mosque in Kufa, Iraq, an assassin from a group of rebels who opposed his leadership fatally struck him with a poisoned sword. Ali died two days later.\n\nAli is a hugely important figure in Shia Islam. His tomb in nearby Najaf, Iraq, is the third-holiest site in Shia Islam, and millions of Shia make pilgrimage there every year. Although Sunnis revere Ali as one of the four \"rightly guided\" caliphs who ruled after Mohammed's death, they do not commemorate his death or make pilgrimage to his tomb.\n\n The tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib in Najaf, Iraq. Toushiro, public domain\n\n8) What can I do to be respectful of my Muslim friends during Ramadan?\n\nIn some Muslim countries, it is a crime to eat and drink in public during the day in the month of Ramadan, even if you're not Muslim.\n\nOf course, this is not the case in the United States, where we enjoy freedom of (and freedom from) religion. And most American Muslims, myself included, don't expect the non-Muslims around us to radically change their behavior to accommodate our religious fast during Ramadan.\n\nI've had friends and co-workers who have chosen to fast along with me out of solidarity (or just because it seems \"fun\"), and that was sweet of them, but it's not something I ever expected people to do. (Plus, they usually last about four days before they decide solidarity is overrated and being thirsty for 15 hours is not even remotely \"fun.\")\n\nAll that said, there are things you can do — and not do — to make things a little easier for friends or colleagues who happen to be fasting for Ramadan. If you share an office with someone fasting, maybe eat your delicious, juicy cheeseburger in the office break room rather than at your desk, where your poor, suffering Muslim co-workers will have to smell it and salivate (if they even have enough moisture left in their bodies to salivate at that point).\n\nTry to remember not to offer them a bite or a sip of what you're eating, because it's sometimes hard for us to remember that we're fasting and easy to absentmindedly accept and eat that Lay's potato chip you just offered us. But if you do, it's okay. We're not going to get mad or be offended (unless you're doing it on purpose, in which case, what is wrong with you?).\n\nIf you're having a dinner party and you want to invite your Muslim friends, try to schedule it after sunset so they can eat. Muslims don't drink alcohol or eat pork, but we usually don't mind being around it. (Contrary to popular belief, we are not scared of or allergic to pork; we just don't eat it. It's not like we're vampires and pork is garlic.) But do let us know if there's alcohol or pork in something so we don't accidentally eat it.\n\nIf you want to wish your Muslim friends or acquaintances a happy Ramadan, you're welcome to just say, \"Happy Ramadan!\" That's not offensive or anything. But if you want to show them you made an effort to learn more about their religion, the standard Ramadan greetings are \"Ramadan kareem\" (which means \"have a generous Ramadan\") or \"Ramadan mubarak\" (which means \"have a blessed Ramadan\").\n\nEven something as simple as learning one of those expressions and saying it with a smile to your Muslim friends will go a long way toward making them feel comfortable and welcome.\n\n9) So if you're not supposed to get angry or complain or gossip during Ramadan, how come terrorist attacks by groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda always seem to spike during Ramadan?\n\nBecause terrorists are assholes.\n\nWatch: Muhammad Ali's biggest fights were outside the ring\n",

          "description": "Today (May 24), during the quick Roman stop of his first trip abroad as president, Donald Trump met with Pope Francis. With him were his wife Melania, his daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nAll four dressed according to traditional Vatican etiquette, which demands that men wear dark suits and women wear black clothing that covers the shoulders and arms, most of the legs, and the cleavage. Additionally, women should wear a veil, which can be combined with another form of head covering. (There’s an exception for queens of Catholic countries, who enjoy the privilège du blanc, the privilege of white.)\n\nUnder Pope Francis, however, this strict dress code has been somewhat relaxed (link in Italian), according to Il Mio Papa, an Italian site dedicated to papal news. Most female politicians and high-profile women meeting with him have forgone the strict black attire and veil.\n\nThis made Melania and Ivanka Trump’s decision to embrace traditional dress a powerful political sign—especially considering they made the opposite choice when visiting Saudi Arabia few days earlier, by not wearing the headscarves customary in Islamic tradition.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint their choice in Riyadh was in fact perfectly fine. Though Saudi women have to follow the legal imposition (paywall) of wearing an abaya—a long black dress—and a headscarf, non-Muslim women are allowed to leave their heads uncovered.\n\nBut the Trumps’ clothing choices in both Riyadh and the Vatican nonetheless sent clear messages about the attitude of the US towards Islamic and Catholic values and tradition. By deciding to stick with old-school requirements in the Vatican (wearing veils) but not in Saudi Arabia, Melania and Ivanka showed the US is only willing to honor one of the two religions beyond the diktats of etiquette. This isn’t new with the Trumps, for that matter; it’s the same stand that Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton—who all covered their heads for the pope, but not for the Saudis—took before them.\n\nIt is a clear message for Americans watching from home, most of all: Their leaders will pay homage to backward Catholic traditions.

          "description": "Nathan Yau from FlowingData has taken an in-depth look at the statistics behind How the Average Working Adult Spends Days in their lifetime.\n\nThere were some graphics going around that showed the total amount of time spent during an average person’s lifetime doing things. The numbers were pretty rough though.\n\nFor example, to calculate the number of days spent sleeping during a lifetime, it was assumed that the average person sleeps eight hours per day, and then estimates just extrapolated for life expectancy. But sleep patterns change as you age. You start to sleep less as you get older.\n\nSo I tried taking this into account using data from the American Time Use Survey. I still used averages, but I calculated averages for each year of life and then aggregated. Here’s what I got for adulthood (18 and older) — the time you’re presumably making your own choices. Employment and retirement are assumed.\n\nAgain, these are still averages for an adult who works and then retires around 65 years, so the same caveats apply as usual. Everyone’s own totals will be a bit different, especially as you compare across groups. For example, the time distribution for parents looks different from the distribution for those who never have kids. Similarly, some never enter the labor force whereas others work full-time.\n\nThe data is from the American Time Use Survey, which is made more easily available from IPUMS. After downloading data for 2011 through 2015, I tabulated and charted in R. Also, maybe you noticed that the number of squares doesn’t quite add up to 22,573. This is due to rounding, which offset the total above by three days.\n\nI prefer data visualizations like this that show the actual number of days as squares (or other shapes/icons) instead of summarizing them together into a stacked bar chart or a doughnut chart. Seeing the full number of days represented gives the readfers a better understanding of the true magnitude of the values being shown\n\nFound on Big Think\n",

It’s a startup committed to making bespoke plywood worktops, drawer fronts, cover panels, spacer panels, and doors that adapt themselves naturally to IKEA’s wildly popular METOD kitchen line.\n\nPhoto by Plykea\n\nPlykea grew out of the men's mutual realization that there was no centralized node committed to simplifying a process that many homeowners tried to do on their own: to enliven their IKEA kitchens with a wider, more aesthetically-enticing array of materials than the particleboard offered to them. The two often found that re-outfitting IKEA's METOD line with new, birch plywood fronts was unsettlingly expensive, a byproduct of this decentralization.\n\nSo the two teamed up to offer a solution to other homeowners suffering from this same predicament of trying to make their IKEA kitchens feel more personal without totaling their wallets. Both are pretty high-profile designers—Diacon is a co-founder of design agency Normally, while Vergette is an alum of furniture company Vitsoe—and they settled on a simple, obvious name, a portmanteau of plywood and IKEA.\n\nPhotos by Plykea\n\nI’m afraid that Plykea only ships within the United Kingdom for now, but they’re a mere month old.

          "description": "Before you ever get the chance to extol your virtues to a potential employer during an in-person interview, it’s likely you’ll have first answered some questions over the phone or via Skype (or other video software). It’s easier for all parties, especially for the first round when you’re really just trying to feel each other out.\n\nIt can be easy to be less prepared for these types of interviews — they just don’t feel like they carry the same weight as meeting someone face-to-face. But taking a lax approach would be a mistake. In many ways, this first impression is more important, because it’s just that — a company’s first impression of the kind of employee you’d be. You’ll never make it deeper into the hiring process if you’re stopped at the gate.\n\nIn general, you want to prepare for these interviews just as you would the in-person variety: go into it knowing how to tell your career story in just a couple minutes, explain unconventional aspects of your resume, answer behavioral questions — that sort of thing.\n\nTo get you started, here are a few articles we’ve done about job interviews:\n\nHow to Control a Job Interview\n\n10 Questions to Ask in a Job Interview\n\nHow to Ace a Job Interview\n\nHow to Prepare for and Rock a Behavioral Job Interview\n\nHow to Talk About Your Unconventional Background\n\nBe sure to read up on those, as I’m not going to cover all the general basics of interviews below. Rather, while I’ll take you through some classic interview tips, they’ll be focused specifically on the context of handling a phone and/or video conversation.\n\nTips That Apply to Both Phone & Skype Interviews\n\nChoose a Quiet, Reliable Location\n\nStick to your house for phone and Skype interviews. Don’t try to do it at a coffee shop; that’ll annoy both the interviewer (background noise can make it hard to hear you), and the other coffee shop patrons as well. Plus, you just aren’t in control of your environment. The crashing sound of someone spilling a drink nearby can throw you off your game.\n\nOf course you want to choose a place with reliable cell service and/or internet. If your home office is in the basement, but you don’t get good cell service down there, head upstairs. For a phone call, your parked car can even work great (so long as you aren’t in a parking garage, where cell service is always spotty). If you know there’s a corner of the house where the wifi is spotty, best not to head there for your video chat.\n\nAnd if your own abode doesn’t work, ask a friend or family member if you can steal a room for 30-60 minutes.\n\nOf course, don’t do the interview at your workplace, and especially not on company time!\n\nThere are additional location considerations when video chatting, which I’ll cover in more detail below.\n\nDress & Groom Appropriately\n\nThis is obvious if it’s a video interview — you can’t look like a schlub in front of an interviewer. On the phone, though, you might be tempted to rock some sweats and not bother with combing your hair. I don’t recommend that.\n\nRather, whether the interview is on the phone or over video, dress and groom just as you would if it was an in-person meeting. It gets you in the right mindset for the position you want to hold. If you go through the routine of getting ready for an interview, you’ll jump into things as if you were right in the interviewer’s office. That time spent getting ready even serves to allow you to rehearse things in your mind versus sitting on the couch watching TV right up until it’s time for the interview. Your head just won’t be in the game in the same way.\n\nSo shower, shave, and even for a phone interview, throw on a decent outfit. For a video chat, you’ll want to dress one notch up from the position you’re applying for, which often means donning a shirt and tie or a suit. (And no, don’t wear a nice top while in your underwear; what happens when you unexpectedly need to get up to grab something?)\n\nBe On Time\n\nFor an in-person interview, showing up 15 minutes early is on-time. You don’t want to be flying in the doors right when the interview is supposed to start.\n\nFor phone or Skype interviews, the rules are a little different. While you don’t want to call 15 minutes early, you should be at your desk and ready to go at least that much time in advance. Check your cell service, internet connection, etc. You also want just a few minutes to get in the right mindset, look over your resume and cover letter one last time, have a sip of water, etc.\n\nAlso be sure you’ve nailed down details of who’s calling who. You don’t want your potential employer waiting for 10 minutes just because you were supposed to dial in to a conference line and you’ve been sitting there staring at your phone.\n\nSpeak Clearly and Enunciate\n\nWhile you want to do these things in person too, they’re even more important with a phone or video interview. Speak a little more loudly than you normally would, a little more slowly, and really focus on enunciating your words. You know how it goes on the phone or over Skype — even with the best connections things are easily muddled or missed and an “I’m sorry, what was that?” is almost inevitable. Reduce those awkward exchanges as much as possible.\n\nHone in On Non-Verbal Cues\n\nMuch of conversation happens through our body language — the gestures we make, facial expressions, even minor shifts in how we’re sitting. Those are obviously entirely absent in phone calls, and harder to read in video interviews. So you really have to pay extra attention to things like tone of voice and subtle changes in inflection to know when to chime in with an answer, or even just to give an affirmative “Sure” or “Yeah, that makes sense” to show that you’re listening attentively. Better, in my opinion, to speak up a little too much versus sitting silently for too long and letting the interviewer wonder if you’re paying attention.\n\nIn general, you do this simply by practicing. When on the phone with other people, really practice active listening. Nod your head even though they can’t see you and offer short phrases to show you’re listening (as mentioned above). If you’re in the process of interviewing for jobs, make it a habit to pick up the phone a little more just so you can get comfortable with it. Call your friends, your parents, the local Thai place (rather than ordering online), etc.\n\nYou’ll then carry these practices over to when you’re on a phone call where a prospective employer, and the future of your career, are on the line.\n\nBe Prepared for Some Small Talk\n\nIn a phone interview you’re often speaking with someone from HR or a hiring manager — not necessarily the person who will be your supervisor or team leader. You usually only meet those folks in person and in follow-up rounds of interviews. Phone/video interviews are generally meant to be introductory — they’re just trying to get to know you, get a feel for what you’re like, etc.\n\nWith that, you’ll often have some small talk at the start as a sort of test to see how you handle a new situation and new person. So be prepared to have some friendly topics at hand to discuss for a few minutes. (This is especially true for when you’re going to be talking to more than one person; sometimes the second person is late in getting on the line, and you’ll need to banter with the person who’s present until they do. If you’re not ready for small talk, the silence will quickly get awkward.)\n\nNow, this small talk exchange is trickier than with an in-person interview because you’re not likely to be in the same locale. Talking about the beautiful spring weather or the local sports team isn’t going to work necessarily. So find out where your interviewer is located, and do a quick search of their local news to see if anything would be worth talking about.\n\nSay you’re interviewing for a job in Seattle but you’re in the Midwest. It’s easy to find out that Seattle has had record rainfall this winter and spring, so you could say something like “I’ve read that your area has been deluged with rain this season; I bet you’re ready for summer to make an appearance.”\n\nIf you don’t know much about the weather where they are, you can always ask if it’s been hot, cold, warming up, cooling down (depending on the season).\n\nYou could also focus on industry small talk. In the tech world? Discuss some of the new iPhone rumors — there’s always some of those out there, no matter the time of year. In publishing? Bringing up a new book you recently read and loved is always a safe bet. (Actually, that one applies to most industries!)\n\nIf the interview takes places around a holiday, you can ask if they plan on/did anything fun or traveled for it.\n\nAnother option is to look them up on LinkedIn or Twitter — see if they’ve been to a recent conference that you also attended: “I noticed from LinkedIn that you went to ‘X’ Conference this year. I was there too; who was your favorite speaker?” Did they tweet out an article recently? Read it, then be ready to talk about it with them.\n\nSit Up Straight\n\nSitting up straight isn’t just for mental professionalism; it projects your voice better and helps you sound more confident by opening up your airways. If you’re lying down or even just hunched over, your body is compressed, and your voice will give that away.\n\nSmile\n\nYou may think your voice sounds decently friendly and animated when you’re talking to someone by phone or Skype, but it may not sound that way to the person on the other end. When we’re disconnected from an actual human — even if it’s a video interview — it’s just harder and not as natural to smile and project warmth; your voice may come off flat, or even crabby.\n\nTo up the warmth you convey via technology, smile while you talk, especially right away at the beginning of the call when you’re introducing yourself. Smiling makes your voice and demeanor exude a friendlier vibe. Plus, it’ll make you feel calmer; research shows that smiling during stressful activities, even if it’s fake, decreases your heart rate and stress level.\n\nTips Specifically for Phone Interviews\n\nWalk around and make gestures (especially if you’re nervous). Studies have found that when your arms and hands are constrained while you communicate (like when you put your hands in your pockets), you feel more nervous and use more language fillers (like “umm”). This is because you’re unable to gesticulate and thus are less confident your message is getting across. So even though the person you’re talking to on the phone can’t see your body language, gesticulate anyway to make yourself feel better.\n\nWalking around seems to help loosen you up as well, and can make you feel, and sound, more dynamic. Pace around slowly, of course; you don’t want to stride so vigorously you become out of breath!\n\nLook in the mirror as you talk. As mentioned above, part of what makes phone calls awkward is that you can’t see the facial expressions the other person is making as you speak. Looking at yourself in the mirror can help lessen this effect; rather than talking into an empty abyss, it tricks your brain into thinking you’re talking to another human face-to-face and may help you speak more confidently.\n\nAs a bonus, the aforementioned studies on forced smiling showed that its happiness-inducing effect is increased when you watch yourself grin in the mirror.\n\nTips Specifically for Skype/Video Interviews\n\nLocation, location, location. When doing a video interview, you of course want to choose a location that looks good as a background. Your home office is great. Dining room works. Messy bedroom? Not so much.\n\nAlways test your location well before the interview. Have a Skype chat with a friend and ask them if anything looks weird or distracting in the background. Do your best to mitigate anything in your environment that could be a distraction.\n\nAlso be sure to check your lighting. It seems like every Skype call I make involves fidgeting with lights, adjusting blinds/curtains, and spinning around in my office chair to try to find the right lighting so that I’m not backlit, nor in a spotlight. If you can, make your test call with your friend at the time of day your interview is scheduled for so that you can have an idea of what the natural lighting will be like. Play around with things and get them just right so that when it’s time for the interview, your environment is perfectly set up to make your call a good one.  \n\nAlso be sure kids, pets, and any other possible interruptions are securely corralled to avoid a “BBC dad” moment (even though the public loved it, in the context of a job interview, such an incident may read to the interviewer (even subconsciously) as a sign that your life is a little chaotic).\n\nLook into the camera. This is always the tricky part about video interviews on a computer. Do you look into the camera at the top of the screen, or do you look at their face (and yours, to make sure you look okay)?  \n\nThe consensus is definitely that you should be looking at the camera in order to establish “eye contact” — even if that’s not really what it feels like. That way, however, you’re looking at the interviewer straight on rather than with a slightly downward look. Sure, you’ll of course check the interviewer’s face and yours occasionally, but do your best to intentionally look into the webcam for the majority of the interview.\n\nThe post How to Ace Your Next Phone or Skype Interview appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",

          "description": "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for May 7 through 13 is “Chicanery,” the fifth episode of the third season of AMC’s Better Call Saul.\n\nOne of the most famous lines from the classic romantic comedy Annie Hall is when its protagonist, Alvy, turns to Annie and tells her, “A relationship, I think, is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.”\n\nBoth Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad, the series that spun Saul off, are shows about dead sharks.\n\nWhen they begin, their protagonists are trapped in fundamentally broken relationships they feel some need to persist with. But the deeper they get, the more pain these relationships cause them. \n\nIt might be better if everybody involved just gave up and admitted they don’t know how to save the relationship, then moved very far away from each other. But because they don’t know how to do that — because none of us knows how to do that — they end up in spirals of misery and grief.\n\nIn Breaking Bad, that relationship was the marriage between Walter and Skyler White, two people who didn’t quite realize how little they had in common anymore, who seemed to have little affection for each other even before Walter became a drug lord. \n\nBut Better Call Saul isn’t built around a broken marriage, a situation that’s theoretically solvable via divorce or separation. No, Better Call Saul is built around something more primal, something harder to fix — a relationship between brothers.\n\n“Chicanery” pits Jimmy McGill against his brother Chuck in court. It’s a fight that destroys them both.\n\nFrom the first, Better Call Saul has had a bigger heart than its parent series. Breaking Bad often suggested that when the chips are down, most people will make the morally expedient choice. Those who love them will be forced to choose: call out the one you love, or go down with the ship? At a certain point, if you’re bound to someone through marriage or other familial ties, they can damn your soul simply by choices they make. As such, much of the show’s later seasons hinged on what the characters around Walter did as they learned of his actions.\n\nSaul, on the other hand, is about people wanting others to be better, despite the best interests of both parties. In this case, brothers Jimmy (the man who will become Saul Goodman) and Chuck McGill are trapped by perceptions of each other they came to when they were much younger, which continue to influence their interactions in the present, to the detriment of both.\n\nChuck can only see his brother as the shady, not-to-be-trusted kid who stole from the till of their parents’ store. Jimmy can only see his brother as the super smart, super competent lawyer he knew way back when. Both have changed noticeably. But both also seemingly expect the other to revert to their old self at any given moment.\n\n        Chuck’s aversion to electricity has driven much of the series. AMC\n\nThey’re not without reason to expect that reversion. Jimmy may now be a lawyer, one who’s devoted himself to elder law and done some promising work, but he’s still constantly tempted to take the easy route, which often leads him down unethical paths. And Chuck might be stuck in his home, thanks to an imaginary illness that’s actually a manifestation of his troubled mental state, but he continues to have a crackerjack mind that devotes itself mostly to outwitting his brother.\n\nThese two perceptions are set on a collision course in “Chicanery,” which centers on Chuck’s attempts to have Jimmy disbarred for felonious actions he undertook in the wake of Chuck taping Jimmy confessing to one of his bigger sins. He sees this as a mercy — he won’t have Jimmy jailed, but he will keep Jimmy away from the law, which Chuck considers sacred.\n\nJimmy, of course, wants to keep being a lawyer. And he can’t be disbarred without a hearing, which he and his lover/best friend/lawyer Kim turn into a high stakes game of chicken with Chuck. Almost all of Chuck’s objections to his brother can be tossed aside if the two can just convince the court Chuck is mentally ill, not physically sick. And to do that, they have to cause him to have an outburst on the stand. In other words, Jimmy will have to abjectly humiliate the brother he venerates so much.\n\nThat he does is a foregone conclusion — we know Jimmy will continue to practice law in New Mexico for years to come, even if he eventually changes his name. But “Chicanery” makes viewers feel the weight of every moment of that showdown, from the early going when Chuck seems to have the upper hand, to the moment when Jimmy delivers the killing blow — and seems utterly destroyed by having done so.\n\n“Chicanery” is a great example of just how exquisitely crafted this show is\n\nThere’s something effortless to the way Better Call Saul makes great TV. It has maybe 20 percent of the outward flash of Breaking Bad — it’s probably not going to start blowing up nursing homes any time soon — but just as much emotional and psychological depth. If Breaking Bad was often ostentatious in its stylishness, Better Call Saul takes a worn down TV genre (the legal drama) and makes it deeply compelling through sheer force of craft.\n\nLook at how “Chicanery” is shot, by Daniel Sackheim (who also shot the past week’s exemplary Leftovers episode, in a neat coincidence). The final shot of the episode — Chuck, tiny, on the witness stand, looking up at a humming EXIT sign dominating the foreground — carries with it multiple meanings in a single image. \n\nFirst, consider that Chuck’s imagined illness causes him acute sensitivity to electricity. Earlier in the episode, he was informed the exit signs would have to remain on in the courtroom in order to stay up to building codes, and he said that, sure, he could deal with that small amount of pain. \n\nBut after Jimmy proves the illness is all in his head (by having Breaking Bad carryover Huell nimbly plant a cell phone battery in Chuck’s pocket), the final shot gains added poignancy: Chuck not only continues to feel the imagined pain of the exit sign, but also the actual pain of what his brother has done to him in front of trusted friends and colleagues. He might be looking at a way out, but he has no way to take it.\n\n        Jimmy and Kim ponder their next move.AMC\n\nThe episode’s script, by Gordon Smith, similarly displays how good the series’ writers are at being casually clever. It foregrounds, at every moment, the fact that Jimmy and Kim are Up To Something, but it never once lets you know precisely what they’re doing, leaving you more or less in Chuck’s shoes. \n\nWhen Jimmy somehow convinces Chuck’s ex-wife to attend the hearing, is that his trump card? When Jimmy pulls a cell phone out of his own pocket, is that the final grace note? Chuck never sees the battery gambit coming, and neither do we, because the episode keeps us in the dark. But because we know we’re in the dark, we somehow don’t mind. It somehow becomes compelling to wait for the other shoe to drop.\n\nThis almost workmanlike devotion to small-scale but gorgeously crafted drama has earned Better Call Saul accusations of being too boring from some corners, and as if to compensate, season three has steadily ramped up storylines about Albuquerque’s criminal element, now featuring Breaking Bad favorite Gus Fring. These stories, too, brim with beautiful shots and clever story turns, along with tremendous performances. \n\nBut for me, they’ll never be as compelling as the story of Jimmy and Chuck, two brothers bound together in fierce love and fierce hate, strapped to the same shark, not quite realizing it’s dead, plunging into the abyss together. This isn’t a show about violence against the body. It’s about violence against the heart. That’s made all the difference.\n\nBetter Call Saul airs Mondays at 10 pm Eastern on AMC. Previous seasons are on Netflix.\n",

          "description": "One year ago, I was working part-time as a route setter at a rock climbing gym in Tennessee. Today I’m working as a software engineer at a cyber-security startup in San Francisco.\n\nMy journey to this point has been unforgettable and life-changing. And yet as challenging as everything was, I think that any sufficiently-motivated person could do the same.\n\nKnowledge has become democratized. All you need to reach a competitive level in your field is time and dedication. This is especially true for the field of software engineering.\n\nIn 2016, my life was falling apart\n\nWhen I started learning to code in 2016, I guess you could say my life was falling apart.\n\nI’d gone to college as a pre-med student, with degrees in biochemistry and anthropology. But I quickly became disenchanted with science and medicine, and left college with no clear path.\n\nI started working as a routesetter at rock climbing gyms for almost 2 years, but things were not going so well. I knew I was in need of a big change.\n\nI had been putting off learning to code for a long time, but I knew this was what I wanted to do. Finally, on my birthday in 2016, I committed to learning to code. I didn’t look back.\n\nAt this point in time, I was vaguely familiar with the coding bootcamps that have become quite ubiquitous over the last few years. Luckily, I quickly discovered freeCodeCamp. When I realized that finishing their curriculum entailed writing software for non-profit organizations, I promptly joined and resolved that I would finish freeCodeCamp’s open-source curriculum before even considering a bootcamp.\n\nfreeCodeCamp rapidly became the core of my education. I supplemented it with many other resources, such as podcasts, tutorials, open-courseware, and healthy doses of documentation and Stack Overflow when needed.\n\nTypical days involved me working through freeCodeCamp challenges and projects, which allowed me to progressively improve my skills.\n\nWhen sitting and writing code became unproductive, I would absorb material through other channels: audio, video, and so on. I moved back and forth between different learning methods, which was very useful in maintaining a strong level of engagement and focus. This was basically my process, and it allowed me to dedicate many hours to learning.\n\nHere it is by the numbers (roughly estimated):\n\nTotal duration learning: less than 12 months\n\nTotal hours: ~2,500\n\nTotal projects completed: 70+\n\nTotal CS courses watched: ~10\n\nTotal GitHub commits: 1,500+\n\nTotal lines of JavaScript written: 20,000+\n\nMost of this learning took place in Knoxville, Tennessee, where I was living at the time. I had a strong desire to move to one of the major tech cities, so one day I woke up and naturally decided it was time to drive to San Francisco. That’s about exactly how it happened.\n\nThat night I left, and about three weeks later arrived in the Bay Area. Plenty of time to listen to podcasts on the road.\n\nArriving in San Francisco for my first real job search\n\nAfter arriving in San Francisco and completing the core freeCodeCamp curriculum (front-end, data visualization, and back-end certifications) I had a brief go at job applications. Around 65 or so. Literally no response.\n\nRemember, I had just driven into the Bay Area from across the country. I had no idea how competitive it would be, nor how much my skills were even worth to employers at their current level. Did freeCodeCamp actually measure up to the education of an in-person coding bootcamp?\n\nThese feeler applications gave me a clear reading: I had to do more. The market is pretty competitive. So I rapidly revised my plans, extended my time horizon, and reached out to freeCodeCamp to begin a non-profit project, since I was now eligible to start one.\n\nMeanwhile, I began networking in the city as much as possible. The networking came easily enough, as freeCodeCamp has many self-organized campsites throughout the world’s cities.\n\nI got a quick response from freeCodeCamp’s team about the nonprofit projects. Some of my React projects had caught the eye of Michael D. Johnson and Quincy Larson, and they asked me whether I’d be interested in helping write their React curriculum. (freeCodeCamp itself is a nonprofit.) I also helped build a conference management tool for the Conference on Crimes Against Women.\n\nI was very excited about the opportunity to give back to this awesome community, so I quickly accepted the challenge. My React and Redux challenges are being incorporated into their newly expanded curriculum, which is now live in beta form live here.\n\nIn addition, I chose to advance my timeline to 2017. I would continue studying on my own for the remainder of 2016 before applying for jobs again. I left San Francisco, droving north through Portland and Seattle to Bellingham, Washington.\n\nIt was during these weeks in the pacific northwest that I worked non-stop to complete the React and Redux challenges. I collaborated with another freeCodeCamp contributor from New York, Peter Weinberg, and built around 80 coding challenges in total.\n\nThis was probably one of the key moves that helped set my resume apart, because it represented a significant project that served a real-world organization’s needs.\n\nIn late December, we finished the initial draft of the challenges and moved them into an official alpha release which is still generating feedback from the community.\n\nMy triumphant return to San Francisco\n\nBack in San Francisco, I was almost ready to dive into job applications again. I had decided to join Outco, a crash course in interview preparation for software engineers. I had always been pretty opposed to spending money at a coding bootcamp (partly because I didn’t have the money), but I chose to join Outco because in my view they are trying to serve a different purpose. Outco is specifically targeting the interview process for software engineers, a process which causes friction for many, even experienced and skilled engineers.\n\nAlthough I could write JavaScript pretty well at this point, I definitely was not prepared to solve arbitrary algorithm questions on a whiteboard. That’s one of the key areas Outco tries to prepare students for, because, for better or worse, white-boarding remains a favorite interview tactic of tech companies. In addition, I could defer payment to Outco until after I got a job.\n\nAnd, a reality check: I had been going many months now at a strong pace of probably 50+ hours a week of coding and learning, and I was now literally risking it all on my ability to get a job in one of the most expensive and competitive cities in the US.\n\nI had already made a sincere effort to apply to companies and failed miserably! The pressure and stress were definitely bearing down on me at this point.\n\nI knew success was going to depend heavily on my performance of the next few months. I joined Outco because I expected that their structured program and support would prove indispensable in this last miles of my journey, and it did.\n\nWriting code on paper to prepare for interviews, classic.\n\n2017 arrived and I started Outco. I began to work even harder than before. Tons of algorithms and data structures practice, white-boarding questions, technical questions, pair programming, mock phone screens, systems-design questions—you name it, and lots of it. Not to mention applying to jobs again, and a lot more than I did the first time.\n\nAnd, of course, once you begin to get responses from companies it becomes very time-consuming (not to mention very stressful) to begin juggling all of these interviews at once.\n\nPracticing for interviews everyday is hard enough. Standing in front of a whiteboard in a real interview as they ask you about binary trees is much harder (and yes, interviewers asked me about binary trees).\n\nAgain, the numbers tell the story more eloquently:\n\nTotal applications: 192 (including the 65 from 2016)\n\nTotal phone interviews: 17\n\nTotal take-home code challenges: 6\n\nTotal technical screens: 5\n\nTotal onsites: 3\n\nTotal offers: 1\n\nTotal time to offer: 6 weeks\n\nSuccess Rate: 0.52%\n\nThat one offer was from TruSTAR Technology, and I have been so happy to join their team! TruSTAR is building a platform that allows companies to share cyber-intelligence data in order to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks.\n\nI’m working on the front-end side of their application and putting to use the JavaScript skills I gained through freeCodeCamp. The experience has been incredible so far, and I have been honestly surprised by how well prepared I have been to begin making meaningful contributions to their codebase.\n\nLessons I learned over the past 12 months\n\nNow, finally, here is some advice I would have for anyone looking to do something like this:\n\nYou need real-world skills and you have to learn a lot. That means a lot of hours of work, there’s no way around it. Passion helps.\n\nBuilding projects is an excellent way to learn, and once you know enough it is not very hard to find open-source projects or other high impact projects to work on.\n\nJavaScript and React are great to learn and in high demand! But learn what interests you.\n\nIt’s critical that you cultivate a community of others who are learning to code or working as engineers. Network in your city. Network online. Find collaborative projects to work on. Ask for help.\n\nIf you can afford it, try to have some patience. This is what I struggled with the most.\n\nThere you have it — the journey that led me across the US to begin a career as a software engineer. I’m sure everyone’s path will look different, that’s part of the fun.\n\nFind your own path and don’t be afraid to disregard other people’s views if you believe strongly enough in your own. That includes my views.\n\nThe opportunities in the tech industry are real, and if you want them badly enough, you can find a way there.\n\nAs an engineer, your job will be to solve problems, and if you are self-taught, the first problem you must solve is how do you teach yourself?\n\nCheers everyone, and happy coding!\n\nP.S. A huge shoutout and thank you to the entire freeCodeCamp community and everyone I mentioned in this article (and a few others: Archie, Christian, Beemer Girl and all my friends from home). You have all proven invaluable in helping me accomplish this goal.\n\nThis post originally appeared in Medium. Follow Sean on Twitter. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

          "description": "For most of us, gluten is more or less synonymous with carbs.\n\nThis perception isn’t totally false—gluten is a protein found in grains, which include yeast, and any kind of wheat (and therefore flour), which is a major component of breads and pastas. So for a lot of people who try to go gluten-free, what they’re really doing is avoiding bread—which can be an effective diet for those trying to lose weight. But while the gluten-free diet has become an increasingly popular trend in recent years, research suggests the fad comes with negative health consequences.\n\nIn September of last year, researchers from Rutgers University found that the amount of people living the gluten-free life tripled (paywall) between 2009 and 2014. By looking at trends in the US Centers for Disease Control National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the team collected self-reported data on the eating habits of over 22,000 individuals. Between 2013 and 2014 interval, roughly 1.7% of folks (128 people in a group of about 7,600) stuck to a gluten-free diet, up from just half a percent between 2009 and 2010 (in a group of about 7,800).\n\nIt’s worth noting that, when asked, none of these people reported suffering from celiac disease. The number of people diagnosed with that condition consistently remained under 1% (pdf) of the US population. People with celiac cannot tolerate gluten; when even trace amounts of the protein reach their digestive system, they experience severe cramping and bloating as well as acne and mood changes that can persist up to weeks on end.\n\nHyun-seok Kim, a physician with a background in public health at Rutgers and lead author of the recent gluten diet paper, told the Guardian that he thought that the uptick in gluten-free eating was likely because people trying to lose weight saw it as “trendy,” or used “self-diagnosed gluten-sensitivity” to explain other GI symptoms.\n\nThe problem is, being gluten-free doesn’t automatically mean being healthy. Whole grains have a lot of dietary fiber, which make you feel full and may lower your chances of stroke or other heart disease by about 30%, according to the American Heart Association. A recent meta-review led by researchers at Tufts University of more than 500,000 people total found that eating roughly 50 grams of whole grains per day (about three servings) was associated with lower risks of cardiovascular and heart disease.\n\nOn May 2, the BMJ published the results of a study including over 100,000 participants surveyed over 26 years. Researchers from Columbia University and Harvard Medical School were looking for a connection between gluten consumption and heart disease. As part of the survey, 64, 714 women and 45,303 men—all of whom worked in health care—filled out a food questionnaire every four years about their gluten consumption.\n\nThe study ultimately did not find that gluten-free diets can be directly connected with heart disease, as New York Magazine reports. But the study authors still write that the “the promotion of gluten-free diets among people without celiac disease should not be encouraged.” In other words, cutting out grains from your diet when you don’t need to means that you’re missing out on the preventative benefits they provide.\n\nThe gluten-free trend can actually hurt people with celiacs, too. “I find that my condition was not taken seriously,” Molly Lewis, a 28-year-old with celiacs, told NPR. She said that when she goes out to eat, waitstaff frequently assume that she’s just trying to avoid carbs, and aren’t careful about making sure her food is kept separate from any gluten. When they roll their eyes, she said, “I know I’m going to get sick.” People with celiacs can feel symptoms if they encounter just 2o milligrams of gluten per kilogram of food.\n\nUltimately, it’s simply a bad idea to go gluten-free if you don’t have celiacs. You’re not doing your heart any favors, and you may be making it difficult for people who actually suffer from celiacs.\n",

          "description": "Fried chicken, for some, is the holy grail. People across the country love and obsess over it. Many restaurants and roadside joints have attained cult status, each establishment with its own massive following. Heated debates ensue over who has the crispiest crust, the juiciest meat, the most magical spice rub, and the perfect sides. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What does a nice Jewish girl know about frying chicken?\" A lot, it turns out. I spent the better part of five years working in a restaurant known for its fried chicken, churning out over a hundred orders for weekend brunch. After Sunday shifts, I would find myself dusted with peppery chicken spice. Buttermilk and seasoned flour coated the backs of my elbows, and I wore a perfume of honey butter. I fry chicken like a pro, and the secrets to making it for yourself are not all that complicated. Follow these simple steps, and you too can be a chicken hero.\n\nThe process for creating proper fried chicken lies in this procedural order: brine, rinse, dip, dredge, fry (or bake!).\n\nBrine & Rinse\n\nIf I could, I would like to take a moment to bask in my love of brine. It is, perhaps, the most important part of this process. Brine is chemistry at its finest. It negotiates the relationship between the water and salt absorbed by whatever is being brined, be it meat or vegetables. It makes any meat juicier and removes the albumen from fish (that goopy white stuff). I even brine my vegetables before I pickle them. Brine can be defined as a water and salt solution, which often contains a bit of sugar. The classic brine for fried chicken often involves buttermilk—a tip wisely picked up from the South. It gives wonderful flavor, and milk, in general, is very good for tenderizing meat.\n\nLet the bird sit in the brine, but not for too long.\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nThat being said, there are a number of ways to get your fry on. In Nashville, they dry-brine their chicken with salt and hot pepper, which is great for a well-seasoned and spicy bird. (A dry-brine is essentially a spice rub, but not all spice rubs contain salt—here, salt is crucial because it not only acts as a flavoring agent, but tenderizes the meat as well.) Additionally, some people may not like buttermilk, and a standard brine of water with sugar and salt will suffice. I encourage you to experiment and find a method that you love.\n\nDon't psych yourself out before you start, just use a simple ratio. Remember: you only need enough liquid or dry rub to submerge or coat respectively. For every medium sized bird, use 2 cups of brine or about 2 tablespoons of dry rub. If you are using buttermilk or water, add 5 tablespoons of kosher salt to the liquid and 1 tablespoon of sugar, in addition to any aromatics you'd like. Good options include sliced lemons, smoked paprika, fresh or dry thyme, cayenne or red pepper flakes if you like heat, a crushed garlic clove, and my personal favorite: a dash or two of Tabasco. Warm 1/4 of your liquid, with the salt, sugar, and spices or aromatics in it, to dissolve—but do not let it boil! Remove this base from the heat, and add the remainder of your liquid. Stir to incorporate and your brine is ready. You can brine your chicken for 2 or 4 hours to overnight, but no longer than 12 hours. When you remove the chicken from the brine, give it a nice rinse, and make sure any aromatics that may have gotten stuck to it are removed.\n\nDunk & Dredge\n\nWork quickly, like this.\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nThe process of dunking, dredging and frying happen in quick succession, so it is imperative that everything is in place before you begin. You don't want the chicken to sit for too long after it has been dredged in the flour, because it will re-hydrate and get wet and therefore will not fry properly. You also don’t want to set up your oil too soon, as it will likely get too hot very quickly and then take forever to cool down. I like to set up my dip and my dredge and have either my deep fryer ready, or my cast iron pot filled with fryer oil on a low temperature on standby. More on that in a moment.\n\nThe dip: If you brined your bird in buttermilk, after rinsing you can go ahead and dip it in buttermilk again before dredging it. You can also re-use your buttermilk brine. If you used a saltwater brine and you want to avoid dairy you can use soy milk, but I would recommend adding a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice for the acidity. If you used a dry brine to prep your chicken, you can use either the buttermilk or soy milk dip.\n\nThe chicken needs to take a really, really short micro-nap in the flour (aka, dredge).\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nThe dredge: After dipping your chicken in either of the options listed above, you can dredge your chicken in seasoned flour. All-purpose flour works well for the dredge, and for each whole bird you are frying, you need a few cups of flour with a tablespoon of kosher salt, and a tablespoon or two of dry spices. The seasoning can mimic whatever herbs or spices used in your brine, but remember to use dry spices as fresh ones will burn! You can use dried thyme or smoked paprika, for example, but simple salt and pepper work wonderfully too. I would also encourage you to try reserving your spices for after you fry, which can deliver a potent seasoning kick. At the very least, lightly salt immediately after the chicken comes out of the fryer.\n\nYou can also toy with the thickness of the crust. If you want an ultra-thick crust, you can go straight from rinsing the brine to dredging the chicken lightly in cornstarch, then dipping in the brine again, dredging again, and then straight into the deep fryer. Perhaps this is why so many restaurants have such heated competition: everyone claims their version is the best. You, however, have the advantage of knowing what you like. Want to keep it simple? Go for the brine, rinse, dip, dredge, and fry route. I promise you will be happy with the result.\n\nLeft hand is for wet ingredients, right hand is for dry.\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nI cannot stress enough that you should let as much of the dip drip off before you dredge. Excess liquid will form lumps in your flour, preventing it from adhering properly to the meat. If the flour doesn't stick, you'll end up with \"bald spots\" or spots where the meat will burn. Once the chicken is in the dredge, don't shake it around too much because again- you'll form lumps. Use gloved hands and designate one hand for handling wet ingredients, and one for dry. Use the wet ingredient hand to transfer the buttermilk/soymilk dipped chicken into the dredge. Now, use the dry hand to dump flour over the chicken to coat it on all sides with dry seasoned flour.\n\nFry (Or Bake)\n\nNow that you have sorted out your preferred process, it's time to fry. Whether you are frying in a deep fryer or in a cast iron pot on your stove top, the temperature of your oil is crucial. Too low, and your chicken will not cook through; your crust won't get to that perfect golden brown. Too high and you will burn your crust before the meat inside of it cooks all the way. 350° is the magic number. If you are going to fry, I highly encourage you to invest in a candy thermometer. You can clip it to the side of your pot to monitor the temperature of your oil. Fill your pot 3/4 full, and set it on the lowest temperature on your stove while you dip and dredge. This way, your chicken only sits for a moment or two while your oil heats to the proper temperature. I would recommend frying the chicken for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the internal temperature of the chicken reads 160° F. Taste testing is encouraged, fry up one piece to check your oil, your seasoning, and your cooking time. Cut it open and check!\n\nPatience here is key. Execute your steps one by one with care, monitor the temperature of your oil, and you will be rewarded with beautifully cooked chicken.\n\nPhoto by Bobbi Lin\n\nDon't want to fry? I hear you, it can make a little bit of a mess, and it certainly isn't the healthiest route to go by. Judy Hesser, our founder Amanda's mother, bakes her chicken. It takes slightly longer, but your compensation is in the form of an oil splatter-free kitchen. Also, some pretty tasty chicken. Judy's recipe keeps the chicken in the oven for approximately 50 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nLet's review the process. We brine, in our magical brine, for 2 or 4 hours or overnight. We rinse the salty brine off. We dip, and we dredge, making sure not to transfer too much of the wet dip in our seasoned flour. Finally, we fry in 350° degrees of hot oil for 8-10 minutes until your chicken is a beautiful crisp golden brown, cooked to 160° F, and you are fighting off every member of your household.

          "description": "When lieutenant Gary Megge of the Michigan State Police attends a meeting, he sometimes asks, “How many of you broke the speed limit on your way here?”\n\nHearing his question, you might assume that lieutenant Megge is a particularly zealous police officer. The type of person who walks half a city block to avoid jaywalking on an empty street. The model citizen who defers almost obnoxiously to the letter of the law. But that is not the point of lieutenant Megge’s question at all.\n\n“We all speed, yet months and months usually pass between us seeing a crash,” lieutenant Megge tells us when we call to discuss speed limits. “That tells me that most of us are adequate, safe, reasonable drivers. Speeding and traffic safety have a small correlation.”\n\nOver the past 12 years, lieutenant Megge has increased the speed limit on nearly 400 of Michigan’s roadways. Each time, he or one of his officers hears from community groups who complain that people already drive too fast. But as Megge and his colleagues explain, their intent is not to reduce congestion, bow to the reality that everyone drives too fast, or even strike a balance between safety concerns and drivers’ desire to arrive at their destinations faster. Quite the opposite, lieutenant Megge advocates for raising speed limits because he believes it makes roads safer.\n\nTraffic engineering 101\n\nEvery year, traffic engineers review the speed limit on thousands of stretches of road and highway. Most are reviewed by a member of the state’s Department of Transportation, often along with a member of the state police, as is the case in Michigan. In each case, the “survey team” has a clear approach: they want to set the speed limit so that 15% of drivers exceed it and 85% of drivers drive at or below the speed limit.\n\nThis “nationally recognized method” of setting the speed limit as the 85th percentile speed is essentially traffic engineering 101. It’s also a bit perplexing to those unfamiliar with the concept. Shouldn’t everyone drive at or below the speed limit? And if a driver’s speed is dictated by the speed limit, how can you decide whether or not to change that limit based on the speed of traffic?\n\nThe answer lies in realizing that the speed limit really is just a number on a sign, and it has very little influence on how fast people drive. “Over the years, I’ve done many follow up studies after we raise or lower a speed limit,” Megge tells us. “Almost every time, the 85th percentile speed doesn’t change, or if it does, it’s by about 2 or 3 mph.”\n\nAs most honest drivers would probably concede, this means that if the speed limit on a highway decreases from 65 mph to 55 mph, most drivers will not drive 10 mph slower. But for the majority of drivers, the opposite is also true. If a survey team increases the speed limit by 10 mph, the speed of traffic will not shoot up 10 mph. It will stay around the same. Years of observing traffic has shown engineers that as long as a cop car is not in sight, most people simply drive at whatever speed they like.\n\nLuckily, there is some logic to the speed people choose other than the need for speed. The speed drivers choose is not based on laws or street signs, but the weather, number of intersections, presence of pedestrians and curves, and all the other information that factors into the principle, as lieutenant Megge puts it, that “no one I know who gets into their car wants to crash.”\n\nSo if drivers disregard speed limits, why bother trying to set the “right” speed limit at all?\n\nOne reason is that a minority of drivers do follow the speed limit. “I’ve found that about 10% of drivers truly identify the speed limit sign and drive at or near that limit,” says Megge. Since these are the slowest share of drivers, they don’t affect the 85th percentile speed. But they do impact the average speed—by about 2 or 3 mph when a speed limit is changed, in lieutenant Megge’s experience—and, more importantly, the variance in driving speeds.\n\nThis is important because, as noted in a US Department of Transportation report, “the potential for being involved in an accident is highest when traveling at speed much lower or much higher than the majority of motorists.” If every car sets its cruise control at the same speed, the odds of a fender bender happening is low. But when some cars drive 55 mph and others drive 85 mph, the odds of cars colliding increases dramatically. This is why getting slow drivers to stick to the right lane is so important to roadway safety; we generally focus on joyriders’ ability to cause accidents—and rightly so—but a car driving under the speed limit in the left (passing) lane of a highway is almost as dangerous.\n\nTraffic engineers believe that the 85th percentile speed is the ideal speed limit because it leads to the least variability between driving speeds and therefore safer roads. When the speed limit is correctly set at the 85th percentile speed, the minority of drivers that do conscientiously follow speed limits are no longer driving much slower than the speed of traffic. The choice of the 85th percentile speed is a data-driven conclusion—as noted lieutenant Megge and speed limit resources like the Michigan State Police’s guide—that has been established by the consistent findings of years of traffic studies.\n\nYet most speed limits are set below the 85th percentile speed. We first investigated this topic at the urging of the National Motorists Association, a “member-supported driver advocacy organization” that has made raising speed limits to the 85th percentile one focus of its efforts.\n\nOne member pointed us to a 1992 report by the US Department of Transportation on the “Effects of Raising and Lowering Speed Limits,” which, beside making the same arguments described above, noted that the majority of highway agencies set speed limits below the 85th percentile, leading over 50% of motorists to drive “in technical violation of the speed limit laws.” lieutenant Megge believes the compliance rate in Michigan to be well under 50%.\n\nIt seems absurd that over half of drivers technically break the law at all times. It’s also perplexing that speed limit policy so consistently ignore traffic engineering 101. So why do people like lieutenant Megge need to spend their time trying to raise speed limits?\n\nHow Saudi Arabia got us all driving 55 mph\n\nWhen I drive that slow, you know it’s hard to steer. And I can’t get my car out of second gear. What used to take two hours now takes all day. Huh, it took me 16 hours to get to L.A.\n\n—Sammy Hagar’s hit song “I Can’t Drive 55”\n\nIn 1973, the Egyptian military crossed the Suez Canal in a surprise attack on Israel. It was the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, and also low speed limits in the United States.\n\nWhen the United States began resupplying Israel with arms, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries announced an embargo against the United States and several other countries. Combined with other supply constraints, it led to a quadrupling of gas prices, shortages of gasoline, and long lines at the pump.\n\nIn an effort to reduce America’s need for gas, president Nixon issued an executive order mandating a 55 miles per hour speed limit on American highways, which Congress made law the following year. States are officially in charge of setting their own speed limits, but national leaders (semi) successfully cajoled states by tying compliance to federal highway funds. Since driving at high speeds is less efficient, the policy is estimated to have saved 167,000 barrels of oil per day, or around 1% of American motor oil consumption.\n\nEven as the effects of the energy crisis drew down in the 1970s, the new federal speed limit remained. But rather than insist on the limit in order to reduce gasoline consumption, members of Congress maintained the policy because they believed it led to safer highways. This is shown by a debate over a measure passed in 1987, which allowed select states to raise the limit on certain roads to 65 mph. The New York Times reported that “Critics immediately warned that there would be a surge in highway fatalities.” The dissenting chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee called it “irresponsible, life-threatening legislation.”\n\nCongress abolished the national federal speed limit in 1995. Many states increased their speed limits before they could even post new signs, but many speed limits remained low. Twenty years of a 55 miles per hour speed limit created a low baseline that drags down speed limits today.\n\nWhy speed limits are low\n\nIf you peruse the websites of state’s departments of transportation, you’ll often find a very technocratic explanation of the 85th percentile principle. Speed limits are consistently lower than the 85th percentile speed across the country, however, because there are many limitations on following the principle. Florida’s Department of Transportation, for example, extolls the 85th percentile principle, yet the state legislature sets maximum limits for each type of roadway. Locally, officials can come under pressure from parents and other safety-conscious groups to lower speed limits.\n\nConsistently, the 85th percentile loses out to the perception that faster roads are less safe, so speed limits should be low. It’s a misconception, lieutenant Megge says, that he faces often in his work. When he proposes raising a speed limit, the initial reaction is always “Oh my god! You can’t do that. People are already going too fast.” People think raising the limit 10 mph will lead people to drive 10 mph faster, when really changing the limit has almost no impact on the speed of traffic.\n\nThe same lack of understanding motivates public health pushes for lower speed limits that influence legislation. The World Health Organization, for example, advocates low speed limits to prevent road fatalities, and cites studies showing that accidents and fatalities increase with traffic speed. “When you look at it from a pure physics standpoint,” Megge says, “and ask would you rather hit a bridge abutment at 10 mph or 40 mph, you can’t argue with that. But when I look at correcting a speed limit, I am not advocating driving faster, and that’s the hard part to get over.”\n\nIf someone could wave a wand and get every American to drive below 60 mph, roads would be safer. But since law enforcement can’t keep over 50% of Americans from speeding, putting a low number on a sign can’t make roads safer. Fortunately, American roadways are safer than ever, with highway fatalities at historic lows. Roads can be dangerous, but the perception of roads getting increasingly dangerous is a false one.\n\nPlenty of public safety advocates of lower speed limits, however, would disagree with the actions of individuals like lieutenant Megge. Just as Megge can point to the results on hundreds or thousands of roads which have become more safe or equally safe when the speed limit increased, other researchers looking at data sets of speed limit changes have come to the opposite conclusion and advise that raising speed limits comes with the price of thousands of roadway fatalities.\n\nNone of these studies mention the 85th percentile principle—at least in our review of them—and lieutenant Megge expressed surprise at researchers coming to this conclusion. Given that debates over speed limit laws often enlist experts who make clashing predictions about the effect of raising speed limits, we got the feeling that speed limit policy would be a lot more consistent if the public health community and traffic engineers collaborated more often.\n\nThe other reason speed limits may remain low, which John Bowman, Communications Director of the National Motorists Association strongly insists on, is that cities and police departments use traffic citations as a revenue generating tool. As Bowman says, when speed limits are artificially low, it’s easier to give out citations and pull in fine revenue.\n\nDue to concern about such “speed traps,” Missouri passed a law in the 1990s that capped the amount of a town’s revenue that could come from traffic tickets. In 2010, auditors discovered that Randolph, Missouri, generated 75% to 83% of its budget from traffic tickets. The tiny town of around 50 residents, which is located near several casinos, employed two full-time and eight part-time police officers, turning it into a speed trap poster child.\n\nFiguring out how common the tactics used by Randolph’s police department are around the country is difficult, as is tying it to a conscious decision to keep speed limits low. Each town or city makes its own decisions, which makes it difficult to know how comprehensively speeding tickets are used as a revenue generator. Further, it is very easy for police departments to defend pushing officers to issue more tickets as a goal intended to further roadway safety—as the LAPD did when found in violation of a state law banning traffic ticket quotas last year.\n\nIn our conversation, lieutenant Megge stated that he believes speed traps to be a “big problem” and counter to police officers real role of altering dangerous behavior. In a Detroit News article about a number of towns ignoring state law by not reviewing the speed limits on stretches of their roads, Megge said that he believes the communities did so in order to avoid revising speed limits upwards. This allows them to keep collecting ticket revenue on “artificially low” speed limits.\n\nSlowing down\n\nGiven the inevitability with which most drivers speed, it’s heartening that roadways can be made safer through the very achievable means of traffic engineers setting more realistic speed limits—rather than the nearly impossible goal of getting everyone to drive ten to twenty miles per hour slower. But it also seems counter to other goals. Most people may drive at a reasonable rate, but is that speed low enough to accommodate bikers, protect children at play, and make our cities more walkable?\n\n“I don’t want to lie to people,” lieutenant Megge tells us. It may make parents feel better if the speed limit on their street is 25 mph instead of 35 mph, but that sign won’t make people drive any slower. Megge prefers speed limits that both allow people to drive at a safe speed legally, and that realistically reflect traffic speeds. People shouldn’t have a false sense of safety around roads, he says.\n\nIf people and politicians do want to reduce road speeds to improve safety, or make cities more pedestrian friendly, Megge says “there are a lot of other things you can do from an engineering standpoint.” Cities can reduce the number of lanes, change the parking situation, create wider bike paths, and so on. It’s more expensive, but unlike changing the number on a sign, it’s effective.\n\nRaising speed limits up to the speed of traffic can seem like surrendering to fast, unsafe driving. But it would actually accomplish the opposite. If advocates like Megge are right, following the 85th percentile rule would make roads safer, and it would also mean taking speed limits seriously.\n\nIn its 1992 report, the US Department of Transportation cautioned, “Arbitrary, unrealistic, and nonuniform speed limits have created a socially acceptable disregard for speed limits.” Lieutenant Megge has worked on roads with a compliance rate of nearly 0%, and a common complaint among those given traffic citations is that they were speeding no more than anyone else. With higher speed limits, Megge says, police officers could focus their resources on what really matters: drunk drivers, people who don’t wear seat belts, drivers who run red lights, and, most importantly, the smaller number of drivers who actually speed at an unreasonable rate.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but it’s a formula Americans should love: Raise speed limits, make roads safer.\n\nThis post originally appeared at Priceonomics.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Fall 1996. A young Chris Fralic is selling software for Oracle. He’s not sure what he wants to do next, but he’s always been curious about venture capital. And then some unusual magic happens—a friend offers to introduce him to Kevin Compton, a vaunted name in VC. To his surprise, they talk on the phone for over an hour, and Fralic not only walks away with a comprehensive download on the industry, but a thesis on networking he’s adhered to ever since: The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet.\n\nFast forward to today, Fralic is a successful VC himself, responsible for First Round’s investments in Warby Parker, Roblox, HotelTonight and Adaptly among others. When asked what’s made his career possible, he’ll tell you outright it’s the relationships—built deliberately over many years. This might sound like a common response, but among his peers, he’s acknowledged to be a world-class super-connector with rarefied expertise. Known for helping launch the famed TED Talks (this is his 24th year attending TED), and a landmark Forbes piece on nailing email introductions, Fralic still responds thoughtfully to over 10,000 emails every year.\n\nIn this piece, he unpacks the strategies that have earned him this reputation—including how to become a genuine and highly-connective networker, how to propel your career forward with each interaction (while doing the same for others), do’s and don’ts for getting responses from influencers in your industry, and how to regularly measure your performance in this area so it becomes a competitive advantage.\n\nFralic’s seven rules for making memorable connections\n\n‘Add value in conversations’ is typical advice. This means making sure people walk away with a new idea, referral, intro, etc. But Fralic has found imparting energy to be even more important than sharing new information. To do this, follow these seven rules:\n\n1. Convey genuine appreciation.\nActively project warmth and high energy. It’s been observed people like you when they feel liked by you. So, do you greet them in a way that sounds like you’re genuinely happy to see them? To make it clear you’re interested in the other person, think about what they know that you don’t. What do you actually want to learn in the interaction? Focus on that so that they can walk away knowing they added value too.\n\n2. Listen with intent.\nThe focus you bring to asking specific questions about what’s being said in real time makes others feel heard. This is a big one. Being a good listener is about two things: 1) Demonstrating that you’ve heard exactly what was said by the other person, and 2) encouraging them to continue. This breaks down into what’s called “backchanneling”—offering short, enthusiastic responses as the other person talks (i.e. “yeah” “mm-hmm” “totally” “I can see that”), and asking follow up questions that reference the information you were just given.\n\nYou’d be surprised how often people flub on listening, says Fralic. People’s minds wander, they’ll be nodding but thinking about what’s for dinner, they might look past the person speaking to see who else is in the room. All of this projects disinterest, a lack of value or prioritization for the person, and that can only hurt the relationship. If you’re talking on the phone, asking specific follow-ups becomes even more important with no body language or eye contact to read.\n\n3. Use humility markers.\nWhat you say and how you say it can put others at ease and replace nerves with positive energy—even in tough situations. “I have relationships that have lasted over a decade that started with me meeting a founding team and not investing,” says Fralic. “I’ll often start that conversation saying, ‘I’m wrong all the time and I very well may be here.’” Acknowledging your own fallibility and human imperfection can go a long way toward making yourself relatable. Especially if there’s a power dynamic where someone is asking for your advice, attention or help, you want to put the other person at ease.\n\nThere’s an unspoken distinction in the networking world between the Hunters and the Hunted.\n\nWhen Fralic reached out to Kevin Compton all those years ago. He was approaching one of the ‘hunted’—someone who had 1,000 other things to be thinking about. But he still took the time to engage and it was never forgotten.\n\nYou don’t need to build yourself up any more or explain why you’re important or going to be helpful. Your focus should be on building bridges between your experience and theirs so there are points of recognition, especially if you can organically work in shared struggles or challenges.\n\nTaking the time to call or meet in person also expresses humility—which is paramount if you’re about to reject someone. You want to emphasize that your time is no more important than theirs. “I like to call to explain opportunities I’ve passed on versus emailing. A rejection stands out among people’s interactions. When you take the time to be conscientious and human, people are often appreciative and will respect you more.”\n\n4. Offer unvarnished honesty.\nThere are a lot of reasons why people don’t share what they truly think in professional situations. They don’t want to tarnish relationships or endure an uncomfortable exchange or risk being disliked. Even if you’re one of the ‘Hunted,’ it’s human nature to avoid these experiences. You can differentiate yourself by being as honest as you can. Just remember to root your honesty in what will actually have utility for the other party. This will set a good tone for all future conversations.\n\n5. Blue-sky brainstorm.\nMaybe you can’t provide what someone is looking for. But, if you can change the angle or way they’re thinking about something by openly brainstorming with them, you make them feel like they got something special and unexpected. It’s key that you’re brainstorming with them, not for them. So, in the example of passing on an investment, Fralic makes a point of listing others who might invest, or he spends time thinking through how they might pitch or message their business differently.\n\nIt’s best when the conversation builds on itself. He’ll suggest a few names or changes, and then provide a sounding board for any concerns or questions the founders might have. This way, he can help them find a new, albeit slightly different path forward, and that’s what they’ll remember—not just the no.\n\nGive before thinking about what you get. Always offer something of value before expecting or asking for something in return. Key to this is not focusing on reciprocity.\n\n“If you find yourself keeping score in your professional relationships, you’re on the wrong track.”\n\nInstead make a list of everything you feel comfortable offering others (even if you get nothing back). Perhaps you provide connections or advice or office space or a next step in a process. That way, if you have to say no to one thing, there’s still energy you can contribute.\n\n6. End every meeting or conversation with the feeling and optimism you’d like to have at the start of your next conversation with the person.\n“Assume you’re going to run into everyone again—it usually happens either by plan or happenstance,” says Fralic. “There are no closed connections. The world is too small.” When you do meet again, you want the person to think, ‘Oh great, it’s so-and-so!’ not ‘I guess I’ll get through this somehow.’ If you envision running into this person again and how you want that to go, it’ll undoubtedly influence how you navigate a present conversation—usually for the better.\n\nFor example, Fralic is always impressed by founders who—when turned down—send some variation of, “Thanks for looking even if it’s not a fit. If you have other ideas for us or if anything changes, please let me know,” or, “Chris, when we met, you had a question/issue about X. I just wanted to show you what we’ve done about it—no need to respond.” “A person who says that shows she’s savvy enough to not take bad news personally, or create obligation or awkwardness, or continue to argue their point after you’ve said no. I’ll remember her for it,” he says.\n\nThere’s time beyond this fundraise and even this company. Relationships take years to build. Start now.\n\n7. Don’t fake it till you make it.\nIt may be common wisdom for finding confidence, but it has some negative byproducts. Namely, Fralic has seen it used to justify winging it in important meetings. Faking it in this context doesn’t mean bluffing your way through interactions that make you feel insecure or intimidated. That leads to bad decision making.\n\n“I’ve seen people overstate their credentials because they were put on the spot, or blindly target every executive in a room because they figured they should,” he says. “This rarely leads to long-lasting relationships.” If you want to connect with someone professionally to move your goals forward, you need to know exactly why you care about that person or their company. And you need to know how to articulate it succinctly. Everyone seems to have a story about a cold call miraculously turning into a career-making breakthrough. This doesn’t happen by magic. It happens because your sincerity is clearly powered by diligent preparation.\n\nIf you know you’re headed into a call or event and want to make a good impression on certain people, create mini dossiers for them. All it takes is a few bullet points:\n\nWhat are the key milestones in their career?\n\nWhat expertise do they seemingly love to provide? (Possible to suss out from any articles that quote them or talks they’ve given in the past.)\n\nAre there any recent news stories or announcements about them?\n\nWhat do you want to ask them or get out of the interaction if you get the chance?\n\nJust knowing this much will give you a leg up in the moment as long as you’re honest, straightforward, and have a clear objective.\n\n“People approach me through email with ‘faux familiarity’ all the time, saying, ‘Hey how have you been? It’s been awhile!’ Nope. It’s been never. Just say you don’t have a connection and make a compelling argument for why we should meet, i.e. ‘You don’t know me but you’ve done X and Y, would you be willing to tell me what you think of Z.’ It might not work but it has a far better chance.”\n\nBuild long-thriving (not just lasting) relationships—the do’s and don’ts\n\nOnce you’ve made a strong first impression, it’s up to you to turn that one touchpoint into a connection that has mutual purpose and positive impact. This is where a lot of people fumble: They get too busy, disorganized, nervous or pessimistic to follow up the right way. The result: too many high-potential relationships fizzle for no good reason. Here’s a sure-footed way to make sure this doesn’t happen to you.\n\nDO: Keep your ‘dream contact list’ at the ready\n\nWhen Fralic was in the computer reselling business, he kept stacks of trade journals that listed the names of top people in the industry. He would go through and mark those he wanted to learn more from—and, by hook or by crook (pre-LinkedIn), find a way to connect. Once he did, he’d ask if they could introduce him to the others on his list.\n\n“What do you want your network to look like, and what are you trying to achieve? For example, I tell our founders that there should always be a slide in their board decks that shows the five most likely acquirers of their business and what they’ve done to further those relationships since the last board meeting” Fralic says.\n\n“The same goes for relationships with individuals. If you know who your top 5 dream contacts are and what you want to talk to them about, you’ll be ready when you run into someone who knows them. Likewise, it’s good to have a forcing function for keeping those connections healthy—much like the board deck slide, consider creating a rolling reminder to get in touch. As a company, you want to have a relationship with potential acquirers before you call up asking, ‘Do you want to buy us?’ As a person, you want to have a relationship before you ask for a job, an intro, money.”\n\nDO: Craft low-lift requests\n\nMake sure your asks are reasonable for the busiest of people. First, keep your emails short, simple, and to the point. Second, “If you send an email asking for something, do the first three steps of thinking for them. Make it really easy for the other person to say yes or no without creating an imposition. For example if you’re asking for an intro, write a self-contained forwardable email,” Fralic says. A good SCFE (as he sometimes calls it) has a subject line customized for the end recipient and quickly explains who you are, what you want and why—it’s dead simple for your mutual contact to send along. Here’s a real-life example:\n\n———\n\nDate: February 21, 2017 at 8:55:26 AM ESTSubject: Introduction to HUNTED PERSON\n\nHi Chris,\nThanks again for our discussion on Friday.\n\nI appreciate your offer to introduce me to [HUNTED PERSON], to explore if there may be sales leadership roles within [COMPANY] where I can share the valuable experience I gained building [MY LAST COMPANY]’s saas business.\n\nMy CV is attached to this note. I’ll keep you advised with my progress.\n\nBest regards,\n[HUNTER]\n\n[FULL NAME\nEMAIL ADDRESS\nPHONE NUMBER]\n\n————\n\nAlways include your phone number in case the person you’re trying to get in touch with would find it easier to just call you directly. Few people do this. It’s uniquely self aware.\n\nBe really sure of the time commitment you ask from someone. Do you really need that much? “If your outreach is just, ‘Can I take you to lunch?’ that’s a big ask for a lot of people versus, ‘Hey, just thought I’d share with you this quick update about what I’m doing. No need to respond.’ The ‘no need to respond’ is a powerful tool. It sounds counterintuitive, but if you give people an out, it makes them more likely to act,” says Fralic. If you’re aware and respectful of how busy a person must be, they’ll assume positive data about your emotional intelligence and social skills, which could get you further than eating lunch with them in the long run.\n\nDO: Follow up and follow through\n\nIt sounds so easy—just follow up after meetings and complete any deliverables you promised. But a shocking number of people don’t, Fralic says.\n\nActually doing what you say you’re going to do will put you in the top quartile.\n\n“I recently met with Kenny Herman, who used to work for a First Round company and is one of the best business development people out there. In a meeting, he kept coming up with ideas for people to introduce me to and said he’d send over a list that I could choose from,” Fralic says. “Afterwards, he actually did send me an email with LinkedIn links to all of the people he’d brainstormed and one-line details on who they were. With it came a short note offering to make introductions. That’s the perfect follow up. Nine out of 10 people don’t do that. Instead, most people just drop off or forget. Not only does the relationship stop there, but I’ll never use the word reliable to describe them.”\n\nThese days, there’s tons of chatter about building one’s personal brand. Ironically, your brand actually comes from you doing great, consistent work on time—not from investing in social media or a website or marketing your work, says Fralic. You have tools at your disposal to surprise and delight: speed and polish. If you can follow up fast, that’ll get you noticed—even better if your content is perfectly proofread and detailed.\n\nDO: Make your own system for keeping in touch\n\nFralic uses Contactually to organize his contacts and gets regular reminders to email the people he’s marked as wanting to touch base with frequently. “A venture capitalist I admire used to recruit a friend of mine like clockwork—he would inevitably call every single year to see if he would join their firm. It worked. He eventually did. The takeaway: you’re only human, you can’t remember everyone, let a system do what you can’t.” Expensive software isn’t required to create a CRM for your life. All you need is a system that will:\n\nStore people’s names and relevant data like email address, birthday, company, title, relevant personal or business facts that won’t make you sound disingenuous. Don’t ask about someone’s kids if you don’t know them that well.\n\nPing you when X days, weeks, months or years have gone by to remind you to reconnect however appropriate, depending on the nature of the relationship.\n\nIt could be as simple a creating a Reminder for each contact on your Mac that will send you a push notification every 3, 6 or 12 months. This also allows you to put their email address and any short details in the ‘note’ section and access contacts across devices.\n\n“After a meeting, I’ll quickly save a one-minute audio note with takeaways and next steps,” says Fralic. “I then set aside an hour every Friday to go through these notes and write corresponding follow-ups if I haven’t already.” A good meeting recap email can inspire tremendous confidence. Consider sending along a few short bullets capturing the most important points discussed, along with a list of primary action items and who is responsible for them. This will make everyone feel more organized, clear-headed and certain progress is being made—essentially you’re adding energy to an interaction over email.\n\nOf course, while systems are important, don’t let them prevent you from being spontaneous. If you stumble on an article that’s highly relevant to something a valuable contact is doing or thinking about, send it along with a quick personalized note.\n\nIf you can add one ‘Incremental Thoughtful Personal’ email or call per day, do it. It can fundamentally impact your business and relationships in the long term.\n\nDO: Special Ops-level recon\n\nFralic is meticulous about using tools and elbow grease to ready himself for meetings. Every appointment on his daily agenda includes a link to a person’s LinkedIn, plus a few sentences on who made the introduction and the purpose of the meeting. On busy days, he’ll list out key questions and takeaways for each meeting. He’s also a fan of Clearbit, which makes a Gmail widget that surfaces context on people in your address book.\n\n“There’s so much information available, yet people don’t take advantage of it. When I get an email or have a sit-down, you’d be surprised at how few people can give evidence that they’ve done any real work in advance. There’s just no excuse for that,” Fralic says. “I’ll meet candidates who are interested in jobs at our startups and I’ll ask, ‘What companies are interesting to you?’ Half the time they’ll say, ‘I haven’t had a chance to look at your website yet.’”\n\nThis is a low bar. Set a higher standard. It’s worth doing a Google search for tools to discover, capture, and make information about people accessible. This is the bread of butter of services like Accompany, and many others that make investigative legwork easy. You can set Google Alerts for your top 5 contacts, for instance, so you catch every news story they or their company is mentioned in. There are even IFTTT recipes devoted to keeping tabs on your contacts. Don’t accept the standard tools. Go the extra mile to find out more, be better prepared, and keep in touch.\n\nDO: Get to the ‘Zone of Indifference’\n\nWhen you approach meaningful outreach, or a sales pitch, or fundraising, or a new job opportunity, make sure you prepare as much as you can. You’re aiming for the ‘Zone of Indifference.’ That’s where you can look yourself in the eye and know you did everything you could to make it happen. When you’re in the Zone, it’s great if you achieve your goal, but if you don’t, you spare yourself the regret, doubt or stress you might have otherwise.\n\nOn a related note, it’s always better to get a quick ‘no.’ Leave it all on the field, so you make a good impression. If and when things don’t go your way, learn from what happened. It’s better to get that ‘no’ upfront than to get strung along waiting for a yes that never comes.\n\nDON’T: Ambush people (always ask first)\n\nAs your network grows, you can start providing value in the form of introductions for others. But there’s no easier way to burn a bridge than to send an email connecting two people without getting their permission first. Double opt-in emails are a must. If a contact asks to meet someone, shoot that person a quick email explaining who the requester is and why you think it could be a valuable interaction for them. Don’t just paste their bio. If you do, you’ll miss out appearing like the thoughtful strategist who put two and two together. You want both recipients to know you’ve got their back and you’re on the lookout for opportunities to benefit them. And don’t forget to always give everyone involved an out. Don’t create an obligation.\n\nDON’T: Reach out only when you need something\n\nThis can happen by accident or if you feel like you have no other choice. This is why the tools Fralic mentioned earlier are so handy. But let’s say you need to make a decision on the fly. “Check your ”Sent folder to see when’s the last time you reached out to someone and in what context before you fire off that note asking for help,” he says. “It becomes obvious very quickly when someone just wants to use you. Don’t be one of those people. This is a quick way to suffer single-digit response rates—if you’re just asking people for things without thinking about what you’ve done for them recently, or without any context for why you’re asking, people will feel imposed upon. And they won’t respond. Your reputation takes a hit and everybody loses.”\n\nDON’T: Lose track of your response rate\n\nYou don’t want your response rate be at 100%, because then you’re not pushing far enough—you could probably ask for more assistance and still get it. “My goal is roughly an 80% hit rate for outreach,” says Fralic. “For others in different roles it might be lower (if you’re a sales development rep for instance) or maybe 50%. There’s no magic number, but your response rate should make sense based on the strength of connection and amount of personalization and thought you’ve put into the outreach.”\n\nVery few people even pay attention to this metric, so they don’t know where they stand. Learn from past emails to make future ones better. Let’s say you send 20 emails out to close connections asking for candidates for an open role. Tally your response rate. Think about who didn’t respond. Rephrase similar asks to them in the future that might appeal more to their specific interests or personalities. It’s worth your time given the value that can be gained.\n\nEmail response rates are signals of your reputation. Under 10%? You’ve got a problem.\n\n“You’re only as good as the people you know,” says Fralic. “That’s why it’s so worth it to make your reputation a priority. Your brand is what people think or say about you when you’re not around. When they see your name in their inbox, think about what you want their first reaction to be,” Fralic says. “If you follow these principles, your network will naturally widen into a solid foundation. It’s not just about having another high-caliber LinkedIn connection or the email address of a VIP. Those are nice to have, sure, but the real win is knowing those people will respond to you when you need it.”\n\nThis article was first published at First Round Review. Follow Chris at @chrisfralic.

          "description": "President Donald Trump does not sound like a traditionally impressive orator. His sentences are grammatically awkward, repetitive, and composed of highly simplistic words.\n\nTrump’s remarks when he announced his campaign for presidency presents a typical example of his rambling, incoherent speaking style:\n\n“I will build a great wall—and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me—and I’ll build them very inexpensively,” he said at the time. “Our country is in serious trouble,” he added. “We don’t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don’t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating—let’s say China—in a trade deal? I beat China all the time. All the time.”\n\nThe speech was met with widespread derision yet, less than a year later, Trump got the votes to become president of the United States.\n\nRichard Wilson, a professor of anthropology and law at UConn School of Law who has studied the language of demagogues worldwide, says that it’s not uncommon for populist politicians to speak in such a clunky style.\n\n“They use unusual speech patterns and ungrammatical phrases and long pauses—and it kind of pulls you in,” he says. Wilson notes that when he conducted a psychological survey on the speeches of Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj, who was acquitted of war crimes at The Hague last year, the Serbian translator immediately noted Šešelj’s poor grammar. “[Šešelj] has a Ph.D,” says Wilson. “But when he comes to give a speech, he uses a particular type of language. I think Trump is doing the same. It’s what makes him stand apart from other politicians.”\n\nThere are two reasons, says Wilson, this style of speech is effective: “They [populists] want to speak like regular folks and so they often use phrases that are ungrammatical so as to seem popular,” he explains. “But they also do it because it forces us to listen more closely.”\n\nBecause Trump’s style is so confusing, audiences have to pay closer attention to make sense of his words. And this focus means listeners are more likely to be persuaded, just as you’re more likely to be convinced by a lecturer if you pay close attention rather than let her words drift over you.\n\nIt’s not foolproof, of course—listeners can still use their judgment to evaluate a speech—but it does give an advantage. After all, says Wilson, “If you’re listening to someone more intensely, then you’re more likely to be persuaded by that than if you’re not listening to them.”\n\nEdward Schiappa, professor of rhetoric and media at MIT, notes that Trump’s simplicity of language is appealing to some. “Trump’s prepared speeches are pedestrian,” he writes in an email. The president’s language is what rhetorical critics call “plain style,” says Schiappa, and “probably accounts for Trump’s popularity among the less educated citizens who prefer the sort of simplicity we saw from George Bush.”\n\nTrump’s simple speaking style also gives the impression that politics is straightforward. “People who don’t have time or the inclination to do much research or thought about certain topics think they can be solved simply—’build a wall,’ ‘bomb the hell out of them,’ ‘buy American,’” says Schiappa. “These are simple ideas that seem to address problems that bother a lot of people. “\n\nThough Trump speaks quite unlike great orators of the past, in some ways he does fulfill ancient rhetorical ideas of what makes a strong speaker. “Aristotle talked about this 2000 years ago,” says Wilson. “He talks about ethos, which refers to the credibility of the speaker.”\n\nWhereas most politicians signify their credibility by displaying their experience or reasoning, Trump shows his credibility through an outspoken, honest-sounding style. Wilson says Trump’s speaking style sends the signal that he goes “with his gut.” This gives Trump the freedom to change his mind, and also means he’s seen as a clear departure from traditional politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s also a master at Aristotle’s notion of pathos, namely influencing the emotions of his audience. “Trump does read very successfully the emotional state of his base, which at this point is angry,” says Wilson.\n\nTrump has other speaking habits that are often seen in demagogues, says Wilson, such as repetition and disgust. Wilson notes Trump shows disgust in his comments about women, such as his remarks about Megan Kelly and Hillary Clinton, and in how he talks about Mexicans. Disgust is a powerful emotional tool in creating an in group, and scapegoating outsiders by blaming them for any problems.\n\nAll politicians use repetition as a rhetorical technique, but Trump takes it to the extreme. This incessant repetition means that even totally groundless statements are reported in the media. Wilson points to Trump’s repeated remarks about Clinton’s emails as an example of how repetition can be effective. “It was continually repeated, again and again, by Trump,” he says. “To the point where people think, ‘I keep hearing it, so something must be there.’”\n\nBut while Trump’s rhetoric might have won him supporters, Schiappa says it’s far from mature language, or a sign of someone who can create strong policy.\n\n“Trump’s unprepared speaking is frightening in its incoherence,” he says. His language is lazy, Schiappa notes—for example, Trump frequently uses the word “very” instead of simply coming up with a stronger adjective.\n\n“Since the time of the ancient Greeks, one’s spoken words have been seen as an expression of one’s inward thoughts and intellectual capacity,” says Schiappa. “I think that is why so many critics are worried about Trump, because his words suggest a very simplistic mind that may not be up to the challenges of the presidency in the 21st century.”\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Four years ago today, 1,134 garment workers died when their factory building collapsed in a suburb outside Dhaka, Bangladesh. “Survivors described a sensation akin to being in an earthquake: hearing a loud and terrifying cracking sound; feeling the concrete factory floor roll beneath their feet; and watching concrete beams and pillars collapse as the eight-story building suddenly seemed to implode,” Jim Yardley wrote in the New York Times. Cracks had begun to appear in the building’s structural columns the day before, but factory bosses forced workers to enter the building.\n\nIt was the biggest industrial accident the world had seen in 30 years—and global fast fashion retailers, including Benneton, The Children’s Place, and Mango were quick to say that they had no connections with the factory. But in subsequent weeks, reporters would uncover that Benetton, The Children’s Place, Mango, and a host of other brands, including Zara, Walmart, C&A, Carrefor, Joe Fresh, and KiK were, in fact, producing in the factories located in Rana Plaza. By April 30, the New York Times reported that New Wave, one of the factories in the complex, had made more than 120,000 pounds of clothing for The Children’s Place in the preceding eight months.\n\nThis is the mystery at the center of the modern global supply chain: How can brand-name clothing companies, highly valued in the market for their ability to control all manner of production challenges, not know where their products are being made?\n\nTo investigate this question, I made the first of what would become six trips to Bangladesh in July 2013. I met with factory owners, representatives of the fashion brands, trade unionists, government officials, the president of the trade association of garment manufacturers, lawyers, the World Bank, the International Labor Organization, and the US embassy.\n\nWhat quickly became clear was that the brands’ lack of visibility into their own supply chains was not an accident—or really a mystery at all. People described to me an “open secret” of subcontracting that made many factories invisible to the brands. In this system of garment production, the brands place orders with hub factories, which then farm out production to a series of spoke factories. The brands only see the hub factory, not the spokes—or the workers in them.\n\nThe reason Benetton, Mango, and Joe Fresh denied they had production in Rana Plaza was because they likely had not placed orders with those factories directly. Rather, they worked through intermediary agents or had placed orders with a hub that had used one of the Rana Plaza factories as a spoke. When Benetton tweeted, “None of the companies involved are suppliers to Benetton Group or any of its brands,” it was probably right—insofar as the company was tracking only its hub factories. The problem is that a significant amount of production happens in spokes, where workers often labor in substandard conditions that help keep costs down.\n\nSome time after I had published a long report on subcontracting in the apparel supply chain, I gave a talk to a group of mid-level fashion buyers in New York. I asked the room of more than 100 buyers if the practices I described—large factories subcontracting to smaller, substandard factories outside any kind of inspection or safety regime—sounded familiar. The first two buyers to raise their hands protested, saying their companies had very strict codes of conduct and that this kind of thing would never happen in their supply chains. But the third buyer, a woman seated in the very back row, was clear: “Oh yes,” she said, “this is exactly how it works—we have one eye open and one eye closed.”\n\nFour years after Rana Plaza, the apparel industry in Bangladesh remains a long way from being safe and sustainable. All the effort and attention these last four years has been directed at reforming “bad” factories through inspections, public shaming, and threats of lost business. But this model isn’t delivering results. So maybe it’s time for a different tack: a focus on the brands themselves. Fast fashion is booming, and getting faster all the time. Consumers and investors really like companies that rely on the kind of low-wage, low-tech labor that Bangladesh has in such abundance.\n\nSo how does a good fast fashion company treat its workers? I have a few recommendations. First, it has a stable supply chain that features long-term relationships with supplier factories. It knows where its products actually are made, which probably means that it doesn’t go through layers of intermediary agents to order those products. The price it pays its suppliers is sufficient to cover decent wages and safety standards for workers. If it has retail outlets in the US and Europe, it pays those workers fairly and doesn’t abuse their time with unfair scheduling practices. And on the runway, it promotes healthy body images for women and men and doesn’t harass its models.\n\nFast fashion doesn’t have to hurt people. It can be good for workers, consumers, and investors. But it has a long way to go—and consumers can help push the industry in the right direction. When we shop, we already consider factors like convenience, style, and price. Paying attention to how companies treat workers also should be part of the mix. When you’re shopping this week, ask about where garments get made—not just the country on the tag, but the factory. Write to customer service pushing for a more transparent supply chain. (Fashion Revolution has some great templates.) Let companies know that you, as a consumer, are invested in the people behind the labels you love.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

          "description": "A common complaint among women who wear sizes 16 and up is that if they can find items in their size at all, it’s even harder to find clothes that fit well. More than just an annoyance, the problem can be dispiriting and humiliating, and leave women feeling excluded from fashion. What’s especially absurd about this situation is that the average American woman is now a size 16 to 18, according to the most recent research—suggesting that most women in America are struggling to find clothes that fit right.\n\nOf course it’s just the natural fact that not all bodies share the same shape, even at the same size. But part of the blame for the problem, according to industry insiders, lies with the fashion brands themselves.\n\nThe issue is the way many clothing companies create their range of sizes—by using a single fit model and mathematically scaling up and down based on that one person’s measurements. At larger sizes in particular, the result could be tops that are too small in the bust or overly boxy; bottoms that fit in the rear but not at the waist; seams and pockets hitting at all the wrong places.\n\nThere is a solution: All brands need to do is fit their clothes on larger models. The trouble is that doing this for every garment costs time and money, and many brands aren’t willing to invest that—either because they don’t care to or they don’t realize they need to.\n\nThat can create a self-reinforcing cycle, where brands aren’t able to sell their ill-fitting, larger-sized garments, so they conclude that they don’t have many larger-size customers. In turn, they don’t design their new products with those customers in mind—ensuring they won’t win them over. The upshot? Brands are probably missing out on sales they could make if they just fit their clothes better, and customers who wear larger sizes are left with few options that work for them.\n\nHow fit problems start\n\nThe fit models brands use to calibrate their sizing aren’t like the runway or editorial models most people associate with fashion, but they’re equally important, if not more so. Unlike runway models, who are preternaturally tall and thin, fit models represent something like the platonic ideal of a brand’s real-life customers. Their bodies are the perfect proportions for, say, the standard women’s size 6—one of the most popular sizes brands hire. And unlike mannequins (paywall), they allow you to see how clothes move, and can offer feedback if something doesn’t feel right.\n\nHere’s how it generally works: A women’s clothing brand will find the fit model it likes and create its size 6 based on her measurements. Then, in a process called grading, it will use software to mathematically scale the dimensions up or down for its other sizes. For each increase in tagged size, a brand might add one inch to the bust of a shirt, room in the shoulders, and length in the sleeves. Each company has its own rules for how its clothes change from size to size.\n\n A single fit model could be the basis for one label’s entire range of sizes \n\nA single fit model could be the basis for the entire range of sizes at one label—or at several. Some fit models become industry favorites and the template for the fit of numerous lines.\n\nThe method works well enough for sizes close to the fit model’s, but potentially less so as the sizes move away. “When you’re four or five sizes away from a fit model size, you’re talking about something that’s kind of been stretched and distorted, and you’re hoping it fits somebody,” explains Abe Burmeister, founder of clothing brand Outlier, which sells only men’s clothing now but for years had a women’s line as well. “They work to a pretty decent extent. But at the same time it’s nothing like when something is tailored to you, or somebody very similar to you.”\n\nHuman bodies generally don’t scale up uniformly with each increase in size. There can be much more of a difference between a size 8 and a size 12 than there is between a size 8 and a size 4.\n\nThis issue is at the heart of the poorly fitting clothes many brands offer their customers in bigger sizes, according to Mark-Evan Blackman, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York who teaches fitting and formerly had his own large-sized brand. “When certain size ranges are chronically not fitting well,” he says, “it’s because they’re not being fit and are being mathematically graded up.” If you evenly grade the bust on a size 6 up to a size 12, for instance, it’s likely to turn out too small.\n\nBrands need to design for all sizes, starting with their fit models. (Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)\nHow brands can create clothes that fit\n\nThe problem is fixable, though, and the solution isn’t complicated.\n\n“Fit regularly on a professional fit model who is a size 18 or the size most sold by the brand, and conduct wear tests and/or size sets,” says Dale Noelle, the founder and president of True Model Management, a modeling agency that works with a large number of fit models.\n\nWear tests refer to when brands give models or employees sample items to wear and wash over time before producing them for the market. Size sets are when a brand fits a garment on fit models in multiple sizes (the ideal practice). Noelle, who was a fit model herself for many years, says they allow a company to confirm that the grading rules they’ve applied fit all their sizes well—so that pockets are hitting in the right place, for instance, and the dimensions look right on most customers.\n\nThere’s a bit potential benefit for brands taking these steps: Customers who wear larger sizes tend to be loyal shoppers once they find a brand that fits them—as the success of the millennial-favorite ModCloth has found, marketing its quirky, hip, vintage-inspired style to a wide range of sizes. The Walmart-owned e-commerce company Jet recently purchased the company.\n\nMarshall Cohen, chief retail analyst for research firm NPD Group, estimates that sales of what are generally called plus-size clothes, most often meaning size 16 and up, are about half what they could be if the fashion industry made more options available.\n\nAnd why they don’t\n\nBrands don’t generally share their fitting practices outside the company, but Blackman calls it “industry knowledge” that most do not use multiple fit models for sizing.\n\nNoelle’s experience backs his statement. She says most companies use one fit model for each of their lines. The typical model used for missy sizing—the industry name for the common run of sizes—is a 6. Brands with plus lines often will hire a size 18 model for fittings and grade its other sizes based on her measurements. But many brands still don’t have dedicated lines for their larger customers, and if they offer sizes above 16, they may still be basing the measurements on that size 6 model.\n\nOne reason many brands don’t hire fit models in different sizes is the cost. Depending on the city and model, they can command rates (paywall) of more than $100 an hour, or upwards of twice that. Multiply the figure by several models trying on a range of garments—since the cut of a garment can also affect how it should be sized up—and the cost can add up, especially for small brands.\n\nBut Burmeister believes there may be another underlying factor at play. “Our stuff forms a pretty clean bell curve around the fit model size, and that’s how we plan and how we order and everything,” he says. “I realized it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.”\n\n Brands interpret those low sales as meaning they don’t have an audience of larger-size customers \n\nWhat he means is that the sizes closest to the fit model sell the best, since they usually offer customers the best fit and look good in the dressing room. The further away from the fit model’s size that you get, the worse the fit becomes and less likely customers are to buy the garment. Brands interpret those low sales as meaning they don’t have an audience of larger-size customers, which convinces them it’s not worth investing the resources in appealing to that audience—such as by also hiring a larger-sized fit model. That’s why the fit problems in larger sizes continue.\n\nIt’s similar to the way brick-and-mortar stores may come to believe customers who wear larger sizes don’t shop there, when what’s keeping the customers at bay is actually a poor shopping experience for them.\n\nSolutions require investment\n\nBurmeister admits his brand suffered from this issue when it had a women’s line, and understands what a challenge it is to overcome. “Every time I read articles and people are pointing out that plus-size women are under-represented, especially given how large the market is, well you know the sales data probably at all these brands is telling them that they have no sales there,” he says. “Even if you wanted to combat that, if your sales data is telling you ‘don’t bother,’ it takes a real commitment in order to get there.”\n\nTo complicate matters further, many brands consider just one body shape, when Blackman says women generally fall into one of four different shapes, which can be more pronounced in larger sizes: A woman’s figure might run straight from top to bottom; she might have an hourglass figure; and then there are women who are larger on top than on the bottom, and vice versa.\n\nThese challenges aren’t insurmountable, however. “It’s tough to go after four [shapes], but it’s fine to go after two,” says Blackman. “If you go after two and do it well, you’re hitting 50% of the market.”\n\nTo solve such problems will require real investment from fashion brands in both time and money as they make larger sizes a priority and not just an afterthought. But if they’re serious about serving the many American customers dissatisfied with the fit of their products, it’s an investment that can pay off.\n\n“She will buy,” Blackman says, “if it fits her.”\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "Quora.com is a question-and-answer site where content is written and edited by its community of users. Occasionally we syndicate content from the site if we think it will interest TPG readers. This article originally appeared on Quora.com in response to the question, I’m at the Airport with 90 Minutes Before My Flight When I Realize I Have Lost My Passport. What Should I Do? and was written by Brian Teeter, author of 300 Healthy Travel Tips and publisher at Healthy Trekking.\n\nIf you’re destitute and outside the country, your local embassy or consulate can help. Every US embassy and consulate has an American Citizen Services (ACS) office to help American travelers in emergencies, including receiving wired funds from the US and replacing lost passports. Visit their Get Help in an Emergency website, or call for assistance. If you’re traveling abroad, dial 001 (202) 501-4444; in the US, call (888) 407-4747.\n\nHave Backups Ready\n\nThis is why it’s so important to have photocopies of:\n\nYour passport identification page\n\nThe front and back sides of your credit and ATM cards\n\nYour driver’s license\n\nPhone numbers of your banks, credit card issuers and travel insurance carrier\n\nContact information for your local embassy or consulate\n\nIf you still have your phone and can connect to the internet, we hope you stored scans of these documents and contacts safely so you can download them from a cloud storage location like Dropbox. We’ll award you extra points if you left a set with a trusted family member or friend back home, since they can do a lot to help you fix things.\n\nContact the Police\n\nNo matter if you’re traveling domestically or to a faraway country, absolutely, positively file a police report about your loss or theft. It’s an essential prerequisite to filing a claim on a travel insurance policy, canceling credit or ATM cards, even getting assistance from a traveler’s aid service or your embassy in getting emergency cash, not to mention a new passport. In many cases, the police might have an idea of the pickpockets or thieves who may have stolen your wallet, phone, or purse and could help to get it back.\n\nReplace Your Passport ASAP\n\nYou will need a replacement passport to return home and for just about anything else you will need to do while you’re abroad. This is a top priority. Locate and contact your nearest embassy or consulate. You can find your closest US embassy at this link; Canadian citizens can find embassy locations at this directory. Ask to speak to the Consular Section to report your passport as lost or stolen. You will need to appear in person to get a replacement, something you can usually do in a few days — if your situation is urgent, the embassy may be able to expedite processing. You will also need a police report, especially if you require expedited processing, but be prepared to pony up: a replacement US passport will cost $140. Canadian citizens can expect to pay $190 (Canadian dollars — that’s a lot of bacon). For details on Canadian passports, visit this site. US citizens whose passports are lost or stolen can also contact the National Passport Center by calling (877) 487-2778, or their after-hours number: (202) 647-4000.\n\nTo make this a lot easier, be sure to do the following before you embark on your travels:\n\nMake a Xerox copy (and upload a digital scan to a secure cloud storage location) of your passport’s information page and any visas. It’s a smart idea to store your scanned images on an encrypted USB flash drive hidden in your luggage or hotel safe.\n\nJot down and securely store the address, phone and website of your closest embassy or consulate of the countries you will visit before leaving on your trip. Make sure to store this information on your phone, too, not to mention in the cloud and on that hidden USB flash drive you brought with you. (You did do that, right? Right?) Here’s why: To get that replacement passport you so desperately need, you must do this in person.\n\nBring along some extra passport photos. You’re probably thinking, “Yeah, right.” Well, bucko, this is why you should. Getting a passport photo taken in a foreign country when you don’t have time, money or a passport is a pain in the butt-tocks. When things go sideways, it pays to be prepared.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to enroll in the US State Department’s STEP program in advance of your trip, as it helps US citizens traveling abroad by listing your trip itinerary and information with the nearest US embassy or consulate in the countries you plan to visit so you can receive emergency information and assistance in case of a natural disaster, civil unrest or family crisis. Plus, enrolling in STEP can help your family and friends contact and assist you in an emergency.\n\nConsider Getting a US Passport — And a US Passport Card\n\nAlmost everyone knows about passports. Less well-known is another form of a US passport, the wallet-size passport card. We think spending $55 to register for a passport card in addition to your passport makes sense.\n\nBut first, know that a passport card has limitations. You can’t use it for international air travel. That might sound like a deal-breaker, but stay with us. A passport card can be used to enter the United States from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda at land border crossings and ocean ports of entry.\n\nBig deal, you say? Consider this: A passport card can be used as a valid form of ID when making purchases abroad and carrying a passport card rather than a passport when you’re taking in the sights of Rome, Tokyo, or Stockholm can give you the peace of mind that your real passport can be securely stored in your hotel room safe.\n\nNow, imagine if you lost your real passport while traveling outside the US. If you still have a passport card, appearing at your closest US embassy to get a replacement passport will be much easier because the information on it will help the embassy staff with the information they need. Plus, even though you would still need a conventional US passport for a return flight home, a passport card can help you with many financial transactions until you can get a replacement.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of Tetra Images via Getty Images.\n",

          "description": "Over the past 14 months, no group has made America more alive to its rebellious streak than the Trump voter. The visual trope of this number is cling-wrapped to our brains: red hats, stadium crowds, rippling flags, chanting.\n\nBut not every Donald Trump voter was quite so enthusiastic. While we’ve always known his core base was a loyal one, Trump made it to the White House thanks in no small part to a group of voters who didn’t necessarily like him but were willing to give him a chance. Nearly 20 percent of voters in the 2016 presidential election had an unfavorable view of both Trump and Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls, and Trump won that group 47 percent to 30 percent. That made the difference.\n\nAs Trump’s first-100-days milestone nears, his presidency so far marked by unusually low approval ratings, a Supreme Court victory and a failed Republican health care bill — it seems useful to check in with these reluctant Trump voters. They’re a group to watch as the 2018 midterms loom, a barometer by which to monitor a newly unstable political climate. Their support might mean the difference between a successful Trump presidency or a failed one, between the GOP holding or losing the House.\n\nWe can’t go back and find the voters who cast an unenthusiastic ballot for Trump.1 But FiveThirtyEight partnered with SurveyMonkey to survey more than 7,000 American adults during the first week of April and asked Trump voters how enthusiastic their vote for the president had been. (We gave respondents five levels of excitement to choose, from “very excited” to “not excited at all”.)2 About 15 percent of Trump voters said they weren’t excited to cast a ballot for him. This group differs demographically and has different policy priorities from the rest of the Trump cohort.\n\nWho are the reluctant Trump voters? Like most Trump supporters, they are overwhelmingly white — 85 percent — and middle age and older. Forty-three percent of reluctant Trumpers were 55 or older, as were 49 percent of other Trump voters.\n\nThe biggest difference between the two groups is education level: 37 percent of reluctant Trumpers had at least a college degree, while only 25 percent of other Trump supporters had a college or postgraduate degree. This enthusiasm gap for Trump among better-educated Trump voters partly explains why Republicans — most prominently the president — are keeping an eye on the special election today in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, Republican Tom Price’s old seat. Georgia’s 6th has one of the highest levels of educational attainment in the country, and the race is tight, with Democratic newcomer Jon Ossoff making a strong showing in polls and fundraising.\n\nReluctant Trumpers are also less loyal to the Republican Party brand; when it comes to party identification, 75 percent of them said they are Republican or Republican-leaning, while 91 percent of other Trump voters called themselves Republican or Republican-leaning.\n\nBut as of right now, reluctant Trump voters approve of Trump, and not even reluctantly, though at nowhere near the same levels of other Trump voters: 74 percent of reluctant Trumpers approved of the president, while a whopping 97 percent of more enthusiastic Trump voters approved of him.\n\nDespite this general approval rating harmony among Trump voters, reluctant Trumpers prioritized issues slightly differently than other Trump voters did; they seem more moved by traditional Republican Party issues than the president’s law-and-order/build-the-wall-focused campaign promises. While a plurality of all Trump voters said the economy was the most important issue to them, reluctant Trump voters rated health care as their second priority — standard Republican talking points during the Obama years hammered away on the need to “repeal and replace Obamacare.” But the other Trump voters did not consider health care to be quite so important; it came in fourth on their list of priorities, after terrorism and immigration.\n\nGiven their interest in health care, reluctant Trump voters’ reactions to the failed Republican health care bill are of particular interest, and they were far less happy with how Trump handled the process than the president’s other supporters. A slim majority, 54 percent, of the reluctant Trump voters approved of Trump’s role in the health care process, compared with 88 percent of more enthusiastic Trump voters.\n\nReluctant Trump voters are more in line with the rest of Trump’s base on other issues. One thing reluctant Trump voters seem unwaveringly pleased by is the placement of Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court; 86 percent of them approved of the nomination; 96 percent of other Trump voters approved as well. Three-fourths of the reluctant voters think the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is a distraction; 89 percent of other Trump voters do.\n\nBut there are danger signs for Trump and the GOP: Nearly 80 percent of Trump’s enthusiastic voters said they approved of his budget proposal, which essentially serves as an outline of the White House’s priorities. Only about half of reluctant Trump voters approved of the budget. That should worry the administration — a sign that the group that pushed him over the finish line in November 2016 isn’t on board with parts of Trump’s agenda.\n\nMore worrying still: 15 percent of reluctant Trump voters said they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district if the November 2018 elections for U.S. Congress were held today. Just 4 percent of other Trump voters said the same. With about 19 months to go until the midterms, the Republicans and the president are painfully aware that there can be only so many missteps before they lose their reputation with the skeptics.\n",

          "description": "From kids sleuthing around pretending to be the Great Mouse Detective to Elsa wannabes singing “Let It Go” until their parents inadvertently memorize the lyrics, every generation has its Disney fans. But as they get older, it becomes harder for adult die-hards to find a poster for their favorite Mouse House flick that really brings a room together. Mondo’s latest print collection solves that problem with style. \n\nNever Grow Up: A Disney Art Show features the work of 30 artists, each of whom got to commemorate their favorite animated Disney movie of the last 80 years—from Ken Taylor’s futuristic take on 2014’s Big Hero 6 to James Flames’ twist on 1937’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. \n\nFor Mondo, the Austin, Texas-based gallery and print shop, Disney is a natural fit. “The movies were a big part of our childhood, and are a big part of our lives now,” says co-founder and creative director Mitch Putnam. The same is true for the artists. Flames, for example, learned to draw by tracing Uncle Scrooge’s beak and Mickey Mouse’s ears, and still remembers watching the re-released Snow White when he was five years old at the Kingsway Theater in Brooklyn. He was so taken with the movie that he cut out the newspaper review and folded it into his sketchbook, drawing her bow and outstretched hands again and again. In his poster for the Mondo show, Flames drew Snow White and the woodland creatures emerging from a drafting table, commemorating the illustrators who created the first-ever feature-length animated film. \n\n“There’s somebody who actually drew all these pictures, and made them come to life,” says Flames. “For me, art was always synonymous with Disney.”\n\n101 DalmatiansJonathan Burton\nNever Grow Up, which Mondo is presenting alongside Cyclops Print Works, will run from April 28 through May 13. Once the show opens, 200-500 copies of each poster go up for sale. During the first weekend, they’ll only be available in-person at the Mondo gallery; after that, they go online. But once they’re gone, they’re gone—so if those Disney fans really want to spruce up the living room, they might want to start planning a trip to Austin. \n\nGo Back to Top.

Now, the creators behind some of the show’s greatest half hours talk about TV’s most enduring institution.\n(Dan Evans)\nOn April 19, 1987, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie made their debut during a short on The Tracey Ullman Show. Two years later, Fox gave them their own program. In the three decades since, The Simpsons has become an American institution. To celebrate the 30th birthday of the greatest set of television characters of all time, let’s look back at the stories behind the 100 best Simpsons episodes.\n\nTo compile this list, I sought feedback from both hardcore Simpsons fans and former members of the show’s creative staff. Still, it was an inherently subjective undertaking. “You could choose every other episode from the first 200 episodes for your top 100 and you wouldn’t be too far off,” one Simpsons writer told me. I don’t claim to be a scientician, but I tried to be meticulous. So crack open a Duff and enjoy.\n\nThe Insider’s Guide to the 100 Best ‘Simpsons’ Episodes Ever was originally published in The Ringer on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

          "description": "Our brains show us patterns in everything, even when none are present. This is why, for example, we tend to see faces in random structures. This tendency toward finding patterns means it’s actually hard for us to think without them. It requires concentration and a degree of complex thinking—skills we develop as children and lose with age.\n\nIn a paper published on April 12 in PLoS Computational Biology, a research team led by scientists at the LABORES Research Lab in Paris, France figured out that we’re best able to come up with truly random sequences at 25. After that, it becomes harder for us to think in ways that don’t fall into patterns.\n\n“The brain is highly algorithmic,” Hector Zenil, a computer scientist and lead author of the paper, told Scientific American. “It doesn’t behave stochastically”—or unpredictably— like a “sort of coin-tossing mechanism.”\n\nThe research team recruited over 3,400 participants online between the ages of 4 and 91. Each completed a set of five tests designed to test whether, when asked to generate sequences, they would be able to do make random sequences or whether they’d unconsciously fall back on patterns. For example, participants were told to create a series of coin flip results—heads or tails—that would be as close as possible to one that might occur by chance. In other words, there shouldn’t be an obvious order to them.\n\nThen, the team used statistical software to try to find patterns in each person’s answers. The easier it was to find a pattern in a sequence, the less random it was.\n\nAlthough gender and participants’ native languages didn’t affect a person’s ability to come up with unpredictable answers, age did. Participants seemed to think with increasing irregularity from childhood up until their mid-20s—at which point people’s answers looked less like what would happen by chance. This arc means that most of us will hit our most diverse thinking around 25. “At age 25, people can outsmart computers at generating this kind of randomness,” Zenil told Scientific American. After that, computers are actually better at coming up with series without order.\n\nThis work, the team thinks, could be used to study neurodegenerative diseases that result in dementia. Being able to think randomly could be a test of a person’s overall mental capacities, and could be used to monitor the progression of these diseases.\n\nIn addition, Zenil thinks that being able to spew out truly random sequences shows how creative we are. If this is the case, then we would expect to hit our creative peak in our mid-20s. But fear not, aging artists: there are other ways to keep your creative juices flowing, like setting aside time and space to think playfully without interruption, procrastinating, and of course, persistence.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "S-Town spoiler alert: This story discusses key details from the popular S-Town podcast, including the ending. Do not read any further if you don’t want to know what happens.\n\nWhat could antique clocks, burnished gold, top hats, and silver mercury possibly have in common? They’ve all been linked to mad hatter disease, or mercury poisoning, a syndrome made famous by 1865’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and more recently by the popular new podcast S-Town. \n\nIn S-Town’s final episode, we learn that the podcast’s protagonist, John B. McLemore, might have had this obscure affliction, and that if so, it might have dramatically affected his mental health and his decision to take his own life.\n\nMad hatters and furs\n\nDoctors first identified mad hatter disease among 19th-century milliners, or hatmakers, when many of them began to display bizarre symptoms after years in the business. \n\nTo make top hats and other hats from animal skins they transformed into felt, milliners had to separate the animal skin from its fur and then mat the fur together. This process — called “carroting,” because it involved mercury nitrate, an orange mixture of mercury and nitric acid — meant boiling and drying the fur. And that generated toxic mercury vapors. \n\n        Beaver fur hats were common in the 1800s.Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhile this process was efficient, it was extremely dangerous, according to NYU environmental health professor Jack Caravanos. Many hatmakers got erethism, a form of chronic neurological mercury poisoning, which presented a range of symptoms including tremors, nervousness, and insomnia. \n\nWith erethism, “[t]here may be an insidious change in mood to shyness, withdrawal, and depression along with explosive anger or blushing,” writes Dr. Michael Kosnett of the Colorado School of Public Health in a book on clinical pharmacology. These symptoms led to a reputation of “madness” among hatmakers, and the expression “mad as a hatter” probably grew from there (though its etymology is disputed).\n\nBy the 1880s, the adverse health effects of using mercury for hatmaking were known in France, Britain, and the United States. Though alternative options, like a hydrochloride-based felting process, were introduced by then, it took a while for the mercury trend to retire. \n\nFrance and England had stopped using mercury to make hats around the turn of the 20th century. But it wasn’t until later in the 1900s that the practice faded in the US; the United States Public Health Service officially banned the use of mercury nitrate in 1941.\n\nWhy mercury is so poisonous\n\nScientists have learned a lot about mercury and its effects on the body over the years. The heavy metal comes in several different forms, and exposure at high levels to any of these can lead to various degrees of poisoning:\n\nElemental mercury is liquid and silvery at room temperature — the stuff in thermometers and dental amalgam fillings. It’s also used in small-batch gold processing and fire gilding. Exposure happens through inhaling fumes.\n\nInorganic mercury occurs when mercury is combined with other elements, often to form salts. It’s been used in a range of products ranging from preservatives to cosmetics to herbal supplements, and can harm the digestive tract and kidneys if ingested.\n\nMethylmercury, an organic mercury compound formed when mercury combines with carbon, is what accumulates in some of the fish species we eat, like tuna and swordfish. Fish get mercury through the food chain and water containing mercury pollution from coal plants and waste incineration. (It’s only a risk for pregnant women and small children; more on that here.)\n\nInhaling elemental mercury, as the milliners did, causes the body to respond in “myriad different ways,” according to Kosnett. Mercury affects the function of proteins and enzymes in the brain and the kidneys, which causes some of the symptoms listed above. \n\nWhen it comes to how much mercury exposure is too much, it all depends on the rate at which you’re exposed, which chemical form you’re encountering, and your own body. But “whether it’s a little every day or a lot in one day, it’s damage,” says NYU environmental health professor Jack Caravanos, a mercury expert featured on S-Town. “It’s a cumulative toxin.” And there is no treatment.\n\nMad hatter disease in S-Town\n\nThe symptoms above will sound pretty familiar if you’ve heard the story of John McLemore, the protagonist of S-Town. Vox’s Aja Romano sums him up aptly in her review of the podcast:\n\nJohn is all of the following: a queer liberal conspiracist who socializes with neighborhood racists; a manic depressive consumed by predictions of cataclysmic global catastrophe; an off-the-grid hoarder of gold who takes in stray dogs; a genius with a photographic memory who’s spent his whole life caring for his mother while designing a massive and elaborate hedge maze in his backyard; and one of the most skilled antique clock restorers in the world.\n\nBut it’s his unique skill as an antique clock restorer and his depression that come to a head in the final episode. John often finished restoring clocks (like the one pictured below) with a process called fire gilding, which embellishes clocks with gold decoration. In fire gilding, gold is melted into mercury, the mixture is brushed onto a surface, and then the mercury is evaporated with heat. As with carroting, a person practicing fire gilding (without proper safety equipment) could inhale those toxic mercury fumes. \n\nJohn performed fire gilding throughout his life, starting at or before he got to college, according to one of his professors. And John’s friends remember him fire gilding for most of his remaining 57 years. One friend said John told him he was doing it “dozens of times a year.” \n\n“I do not have a definitive answer as to whether or not John had mercury poisoning  and if that could have been a force behind some of his behavior, his personality, and even his suicide,” says S-Town creator Brian Reed.\n\nBut Reed makes a strong case that mercury poisoning from fire gilding could have contributed to John’s neurological symptoms, and his physical ones. In addition to insomnia and depression, John told Reed he occasionally experienced spontaneous vomiting, and his autopsy showed an enlarged brain and congestion in the lungs, which mercury experts told Reed is consistent with poisoning from the toxin. Plus, John admitted to friends he thought he was having health problems due to fire gilding or chemicals. \n\nIt’s impossible to know how much mercury might have been in John’s body, though, and the current owners of his property won’t consent to a test of his workshop for residue. \n\nBut some mercury experts say there’s a strong possibility he was poisoned. “He was doing it for years, so the quantity of mercury in his workshop must have been unbelievable,” Caravanos of NYU told me. “So that’s why his health effects, I think, are completely plausible.” \n\nEven if John were still alive, there’s no test a neurologist can do to for mercury poisoning, says Caravanos. And tragically, once you’re poisoned, “there’s no real treatment,” he adds, since “your nerves are already damaged.”\n\nMercury poisoning today: artisanal gold mining\n\n        A miner in Indonesia pans for gold in Timika, Papua Province, Indonesia.Photo by Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images\n\nMercury poisoning from elemental mercury is rare today in developed countries, mostly because health and safety regulations and practices have evolved such that hardly anyone is exposed to dangerous levels. But among gold miners in Indonesia, Peru, and a few other developing countries, mercury poisoning from artisanal gold processing is still prevalent, says Caravanos.\n\nThe price of gold has risen dramatically over the past 10 years, which, according to Caravanos, means that more small-scale gold miners in developing communities, mostly in Indonesia, Peru, and Brazil, are using mercury to extract gold in their homes. Families will mine rock that has very tiny amounts of gold ore inside it, crush the rock, and then mix in mercury, which has a strong affinity for gold, to extract the precious metal. \n\nWhen they reheat the mercury amalgam — “a pea-shaped nugget of silvery material” — to reduce the mixture back to pure gold, “it’s exactly what John was being exposed to,” Caravanos says. “It’s vaporous mercury. So you have inhalation, and stuff spreads around the community and soil, and into people’s houses.”\n\nPart of the reason these miners continue to use mercury is because they’re unaware of the risks — and because mercury doesn’t hurt right away. “Mercury has no acute health effects,” says Caravanos, “so these people don’t know they’re being poisoned.” \n\nCaravanos and his Pure Earth nonprofit are teaching these small-scale miners how to use other techniques to extract gold from rocks, mainly using methods that allow for the very heavy gold ore to separate out from the materials surrounding it, instead of using mercury to draw it out. Switching people over to this process is tough, though, because it’s so much quicker and easier to use mercury. And even though technically mercury has been banned in many of these countries, the bans aren’t yet very effective. \n",

          "description": "The Greatest, Best, and Most Historic NBA MVP Column Ever\n\nRuss? Harden? Kawhi? LeBron? Bill Simmons makes his Most Valuable Player pick. It’s historic.\n\n(AP Images/Ringer illustration)\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, I was watching my daughter play soccer in Parts Unknown, California, right as Sergio Garcia was stealing the Masters from Justin Rose. The Masters app kept freezing on me, so I settled on clandestinely following the last few holes on Twitter. Out of nowhere, Russell Westbrook hijacked my feed — first by breaking Oscar’s triple-double record, then by beating Denver on a 30-foot buzzer-beater to finish with a stupefying 50–16–10.\n\nAnd yeah, it’s the Year of Stupefying Box Scores. But this one felt extra special: Westbrook had spent the previous two weeks on something of an MVP vigilante tour, one that was missing only a remember-it-10-years-from-now “HOLY SHIT!!!!!!” moment. Fans reacted accordingly, and in real time: exclamation points, all caps, weird GIFs and everything else that keeps Twitter indispensable. Within three minutes, I watched video of Westbrook burying that crazy heave, then being mobbed by teammates in a sports-movie ending that had everything but Explosions in the Sky. A little bit later, an awesome picture surfaced of Westbrook celebrating the shot — flying through the air, body clenched, fuck-you face in full effect — flanked by the faces of Nuggets fans reacting like their cars were getting towed.\n\nWith that, Westbrook’s MVP résumé was complete: He pulled the first Oscar since Oscar, averaged a 32–11–10 for an entire season (it still seems like a typo), pulled at least 12 victories out of the deep recesses of the Thunder’s sphincter, saved Oklahoma City from its post-Durant hangover, seduced a normally crusty NBA internet culture, generated a remarkable amount of respect from his peers, and generally wore down even his most passionate haters. I believe that Russell Westbrook will win the 2017 MVP trophy.\n\nI just don’t know if it’s the right pick.\n\n(Getty Images)\nTwenty years ago, Jackie MacMullan swung the MVP vote from Michael Jordan by writing one “Wouldn’t it be nice if the Mailman finally won?” column for Sports Illustrated. In 2017, most media members agonize over their votes. Transparency helps — you can’t vote Westbrook or Harden fifth just to be a dick, and you can’t toss a fourth-place vote to your hometown star without everyone knowing. We also have better metrics, better access to games, better in-the-moment enjoyment tools, better everything. We breathe the league every single day. It’s a never-ending onslaught of information, opinion, dialogue, highlights and games.\n\nThat constant noise spawns more peaks and valleys, more going-against-the-grain hot takes, more waffling, more getting-ahead-of-ourselves moments and waaaaaaaaaaay more hyperbole. (We’re on a historic pace in 2017 of people using the word “historic.”) For me, 2017 stands out as our first MVP Race On Demand. I wasn’t going to watch the Thunder tonight, but Westbrook has a 32–10–12 going through three quarters? I’m in! That made Westbrook-Harden-Kawhi-LeBron seem greater than it was. In reality, Stephen Curry’s 2016 résumé — 30–7–5, 50–45–91%, 5.1 made 3s, 31.5 PER, and oh yeah, SEVENTY-THREE WINS — trumps any 2017 MVP candidate.\n\nYou know what made this year’s battle so delightful? The flaws.\n\nLeBron’s Cavs limped to a 23–23 record in their last 46 games; that dude hasn’t played for a 30-loss team in nine years. Kawhi would be remembered as our least impactful offensive MVP since Wes Unseld. Westbrook, by every conceivable metric, has been the biggest ball hog in NBA history; he’d also become the first MVP with fewer than 50 wins since 1982, when half the league was downing cocaine like it was vitamin B. Harden offers almost-as-big numbers as Westbrook and an undeniable ability to make teammates better … and yet, Houston won only eight more games than OKC.\n\nCan we call it the most entertaining MVP race ever? For sheer greatness, I would stick the following four ahead of it.\n\n(Getty Images)\n1987: Reigning three-time MVP Larry Bird submits his greatest start-to-finish season, throwing up a 28–8–9, creating the 50–40–90 Club (53–40–91% that year), setting the assists record for forwards and maintaining his Trash Talking/Basketball Jesus/Highlight Passing/Buzzer-Beating ceiling. He finishes … third!\n\nMJ grabs the torch as the league’s Next Great Superstar, breaks the non-Wilt record for points (37.1 PPG) and becomes the second player ever (still) to score more than 3,000 points in one season. He finishes … second!\n\nAnd Magic gently grabs the car keys from Kareem for a career year: 24–12–6, 65 wins, at least 2,927 thrilling plays and his first (deserved) MVP trophy. Signature seasons from two of the six best players ever coupled with a breakout season for the GOAT? Yeah, we’re not topping that one.\n\n1962: A frenetic pace juiced everyone’s numbers in the early ’60s, turning it into the NBA’s benevolent version of baseball’s Steroid Era (complete with beers and Marlboro Reds). Two-time MVP Bob Pettit averaged a 31–19 and finished sixth. Jerry West tossed up a 31–8–5 and finished fifth. Elgin Baylor played only 48 games thanks to military obligations; poor Elgin lived in an Army barracks in Washington, flying out whenever he could (usually weekends) in coach on planes that connected multiple times, and somehow averaged a 38–19–5 BECAUSE ELGIN BAYLOR WAS APPARENTLY SUPERHUMAN. He finished fourth. Oscar dropped his triple-double season and won MVP bronze. Wilt averaged 50 and 26, scored more than 4,000 points, dropped 100 on the Knicks … and finished second. And Russell was Russell: the best player on the best team, the greatest winner of all time. (He also averaged a 19–24 and probably blocked 230 shots a game.)\n\nDid you know the players voted back then? They gave Russell 51 of their 85 first-place votes; it’s a wonderful example of how they felt about Russell and Wilt. In my NBA book, I ranked Russell second, Wilt sixth, West ninth, Oscar 10th, Elgin 15th, and Pettit 17th. Wake me when we get another MVP race with (a) six of the best 20 players ever, (b) the runners-up averaging a triple-double or 50 points a game, and (c) someone moonlighting as a part-time NBA star who never practices and still averages 38.3 points per game.\n\n1993: After Phoenix stole Charles Barkley from the hapless Sixers, the Chuckster won our hearts on the ’92 Dream Team, then averaged a 26–12–5 on a charming 62-win Suns team. (If small-ball NBA offenses were video game systems, the ’93 Suns were Nintendo, Nash’s Suns were PlayStation, and Curry’s Warriors were Xbox One). The mainstream media had turned on an increasingly salty MJ (two straight MVPs, two straight rings, and six straight killer seasons, so his 33–7–6, 57 wins and first-team All-Defense somehow felt mundane), and they definitely weren’t excited about Hakeem’s outrageous Rockets season (26–13–4, 53% FG, 150 steals, 342 blocks, 55 wins, the best two-way center since Kareem) or Patrick Ewing anchoring Riley’s almost-champ Bully Ball Knicks (24–12, 60 wins, lots of sneering). It was more FUN to vote for Barkley.\n\nAnd look, there are hundreds of reasons to complain about the internet these days. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Just know that the internet never, in a million bazillion katrillion years, would have allowed Michael Jordan to lose the ’93 and ’97 MVPs. He should have won seven, not five. But that ’93 race headlined a spectacular year for talent: the MJ-Barkley-Hakeem generation hitting its peak right as the Shaq-Kemp-Payton generation was spreading its wings. And seven fewer teams! 2017 reminds me of 1993 in that respect; if the 2017 playoffs can be 90 percent as good as the 1993 playoffs, everyone is going to lose their fucking minds.\n\n1990: Magic’s shakiest MVP season: 22–12–7 and 63 wins, only he couldn’t have defended Kevin Hart at that point. Barkley (25–12–4, 60% FG, 53 wins) garnered more first-place votes than Magic while playing for a mediocre Sixers team; he may have bested Magic if we’d have known about Barkley’s 66.1 true shooting percentage (????), 17.3 win shares, 27.1 PER, and 128 offensive rating. And MJ averaged a 33–7–6, dominated every advanced metric that we never knew about, and played his usual world-class defense on a 55-win Bulls team … only the idiotic “Michael doesn’t know how to make his teammates better” mainstream media backlash had blossomed into full-fledged ignorance. (Thank God Skip Bayless didn’t have a show back then.) Magic ran the league; Jordan hadn’t EARNED IT yet. Or something.\n\n(You know what? Jordan should have won eight MVPs. My bad, MJ. I counted wrong.)\n\nBut here’s where 1990 goes to another level. Mailman (31–11, 56% FG, 55 wins) and Ewing (29–11, 4 BPG, 45 wins) had their best offensive seasons ever — repeat: EVER — and couldn’t crack the top three. Rookie David Robinson tossed up a 24–12 with 4 blocks and dragged the Spurs from 21 wins to 56 … all of which was good enough for sixth place. And Hakeem eked 41 wins out of a lousy Rockets team by doing this: 24–14, 50% FG, 2.1 steals, 4.6 blocks. I like a stat called “stocks” — it’s just blocks plus steals. Hakeem had 550 stocks that season. HE FINISHED SEVENTH. Vintage seasons from two of the best five players ever, three of the four best post-Kareem centers (including Hakeem, who’s a top-12 all-time guy) and two of the greatest power forwards ever? Yeeesh.\n\nHere’s the good news: 2017’s talent pool definitely mirrors that 1990–93 stretch. Check out my four All-NBA teams … and keep in mind that I can vote for only three.\n\nAll-NBA Fourth Team\n\nKarl-Anthony TownsPaul GeorgeJimmy ButlerChris PaulDamian Lillard\n\nNotes: We’re so deep that Marc Gasol, Hassan Whiteside, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Boogie Cousins and Klay Thompson couldn’t make my FOURTH team. Anyway, I couldn’t reward George and Butler with third-team spots for being the best players on fringe playoff teams. Chris Paul didn’t play enough games to steal a John Wall/DeMar DeRozan spot; the good news is that he’s officially grumpier than Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. After the All-Star break, Towns averaged a 28–13 with inconceivable 60–43–84% splits — only a 50-loss season ruined his candidacy. And poor Dame Lillard … I don’t know what to say. I really don’t. After his All-Star snubbing, he averaged a 30–6–5 and dragged the Blazers into the playoffs … and I don’t have room for him. I feel terrible. Please don’t write a dis track about me, Dame.\n\nThe Nuggets Have Finally Identified Their CornerstoneAfter a rough start, Denver has unleashed Nikola Jokic and is suddenly looking like one of the most exciting teams in…theringer.com\n\nAll-NBA Third Team\n\nNikola JokicDraymond GreenGordon HaywardJohn WallDeMar DeRozan\n\nNotes: We can’t penalize Jokic because his dopey coach needed two solid months to realize that he had the next Walton/Sabonis on his team. Since Christmas, Jokic has been 20–11–6 every night. Come on, Mike Malone. That’s like not realizing you were sitting on Netflix stock. As for Draymond, he’s been the night-to-night engine for the league’s superior team, as well as the most malleable elite defender since Dennis Rodman. When KD injured his knee, Green held down the fort as Golden State’s only rim protector. If Dray shot the ball better, and if his Uninterrupted videos were better, I would have flipped him with KD. I still fuck with Dray. (Sorry, I had to.) I don’t even hold it against him that, if he had never nailed LeBron in the balls, Durant would be on the Celtics right now. Fine, that’s not true.\n\nDeRozan proved that 2-guards could still score 27 a night on 18-footers, violent drives and free throws; you could easily imagine him playing with Frazier and DeBusschere 35 years ago. Wall’s breathtaking speed and athleticism would turn him into an internet legend if Westbrook didn’t exist; it’s amazing that he hasn’t hired Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly to take Westbrook out. And Hayward was the steadying offensive force on a sneaky-dangerous Jazz team — even if it feels weird naming someone with that beard-hair combo as one of the NBA’s best 15 players, there was no way around it. More important, he easily won 2017’s Mokeski Award as the league’s best white player. His first Mokeski! What a moment! Enjoy the trophy, Gordon. See you in Boston in October.\n\nAll-NBA Second Team\n\nAnthony DavisGiannis AntetokounmpoKevin DurantStephen CurryIsaiah Thomas\n\nNotes: This summer, we’re sending a SWAT team to New Orleans to get AD out of there. It’s time. I’m thinking mid-July, when nobody is paying attention. We can’t allow him to turn into this generation’s KG. Meanwhile, Thomas single-handedly won about 20 Celtics games, carried their nightly scoring burden (and then some), helped steal a 1-seed and quietly tossed up the greatest advanced metrics season by a 6-foot-and-under guy. (Throwing up a 29–6 every night with 3.2 3-pointers and 46/38/91% splits while playing just 34 minutes a game? And smarter defenses basically doubling you as soon as you crossed midcourt? I’m still processing that one.)\n\nIsaiah Thomas: “I Feel Like I’m the Best Player in the World”The Celtics guard discusses what it takes to be one of the greatstheringer.com\n\nAs for my podcast pal Durant, he gooses the MVP race to another level if Zaza never cut-blocks him like Richie Incognito. Even with KD missing 21 games, the Warriors finished 67–15 with one of the five highest point differentials ever. Let’s say KD avoids Zaza, bumps them to 70 wins and finishes 27–9–6 with 50/40/90%, underrated rim protection, and the highest night-to-night efficiency of anyone. Would he have supplanted Kawhi as the “best guy on the best team” choice? (I say yes.) Give me 61 KD games over 72 to 82 games of any forward not named LeBron, Kawhi or Giannis. His teammate Curry snares my no. 5 MVP spot for (a) being the most reliable star on the league’s best-by-far team; (b) having one of the better quote-unquote “off years”: 25–7–5, 47–41–90%, 324 threes (second highest ever); and (c) his usual terrorizing of defenders who spend Warriors games yelling, “Don’t lose him! Where is he? SWITCH!”\n\nAnd by the way, shout-out to Curry for leading the way on this:\n\n2015–17 Warriors: 207–391996–98 Bulls: 203–431984–86 Celtics: 192–541985–87 Lakers: 189–57\n\nThat’s insane. As for Giannis, the Freak’s breakout season — 23–5–9, 52% FG and a 6-seed for the injury-ravaged Bucks — easily earned him Unicorn of the Year honors despite Jokic’s late charge. Sadly, the NBA’s digital ballot rejected Giannis as my first-team center, even if the Freak could have fake-protected the fake rim on our fake team. (Could we have handled our fake business on both fake ends with the Freak, Kawhi, LeBron, Russ and the Beard? Please.) I settled on … Rudy Gobert, my runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year, an offensive/defensive ratings god, an occasionally dominant force for the 50-win Jazz, the second-best French player ever, and a lifelong cautionary tale for anyone thinking about trading backward in the NBA draft just for cash.\n\nSpeaking of that first team …\n\nAll-NBA First Team\n\nRudy GobertLeBron JamesKawhi LeonardRussell WestbrookJames Harden\n\nIt’s MVP time. We’re sticking with my four tried-and-true MVP questions, which have determined every MVP vote for me since the early 1920s.\n\nQuestion 1: If you replaced each MVP candidate with a decent player at his position for the entire season, what would be the hypothetical effect on his team’s record?\n\nWe’re using Marcus Morris and Jordan Clarkson as our “decent” replacements — Morris for Kawhi and LeBron, Clarkson for Westbrook and Harden. No offense, Marcus. Seriously, I don’t want the Morris brothers mad at me.\n\n(Thinking.)\n\nActually, we’re going to use Kent Bazemore and Jordan Clarkson as our “decent” replacements — Bazemore for Kawhi and LeBron, Clarkson for Westbrook and Harden.\n\nSan Antonio fares the best because of its Belichickian infrastructure; it’s hard to imagine them dipping below 47 wins even if Aldridge, Gasol, Ginobili, Green, Parker and Pop’s beard were all better three years ago. On my podcast once, Seth Meyers described everything Lorne Michaels built as “The Machine” — stars come and go, writers come and go, trends come and go, but the SNL machine keeps cranking out shows and remaining relevant. Trust the machine, Seth said. He might as well have been discussing the Spurs.\n\nAnd that’s the best anti-Kawhi case other than his offensive impact (not nearly as profound as we usually expect from an MVP) and his workload (74 games, 33.4 MPG and just 2,474 total minutes). Only three MVPs played less than 2,650 minutes and weren’t sidetracked by a lockout or strike: Curry in 2015 (2,613), Steve Nash in 2005 (2,573), and Bill Walton in the 1978 season (when he broke his foot, played just 1,929 minutes and still won). The Machine doesn’t care; the Machine cares only about the playoffs. The Machine isn’t built to spit out MVP candidates.\n\nIf you switch Bazemore for LeBron, Cleveland gears its offense around Kyrie and Love and probably loses 18 to 20 wins, with an outside chance of turning into Portland East (a super-fun offensive team that can’t guard anyone). Clarkson dents Houston and OKC in a more profound way; both teams would free-fall into the 20–25-win range. The Thunder’s brain trust did everything possible to turn this post-KD season into a one-man MVP show, a savvy move for two reasons: They knew Russ wanted to shove it down Durant’s throat, and they wanted to create a new narrative that wasn’t “Kevin Durant ditched Oklahoma City for a bigger market and a franchise that might actually splurge on its players and try to keep the best ones.” Replacing Westbrook with anyone this season would be like replacing Louis CK in a Louis CK special.\n\nAs for Houston, remember when Mike D’Antoni built Steve Nash a high-powered, ridiculously explosive race car in Phoenix that only Nash could drive? They did the same thing here: Every roster move and big-picture offensive decision was intended to leverage Harden’s unparalleled slash-and-kick ability. D’Antoni modernized that 2006 Suns car and accounted for better spacing, more 3s, and more screen-and-lobs, then handed the keys to Harden and stayed out of the way. You know who’s driving that car into a wall? Jordan Clarkson. And since it’s a steeper drop from 55 wins to 20–25 wins, Harden wins Question 1.\n\nQuestion 2: In a giant pickup game with every NBA player available and two knowledgeable fans forced to pick five-man teams, with their lives depending on the game’s outcome, who would be the first player picked based on how everyone played that season? (Translation: Who’s the alpha dog that season?)\n\nAnyone who doesn’t say “LeBron” is lying. You just are. For one game only, his ceiling is three floors higher than anyone else. We’re all taking LeBron. Kawhi’s defensive prowess makes him my second pick, especially if we’re applying the Bob Ryan Doomsday Scenario — if aliens landed and challenged us to a game of hoops, and we had to pick five guys to save the world. (I’d want Kawhi just in case they had a 6-foot-9 alien with five arms that we needed to lock down.) I’d pick Harden 3A and Westbrook 3B. If you have Russ, win or lose, Russ and only Russ is deciding the game’s outcome. Is that a good thing? My biggest gripe with his 2016–17 campaign: his unwillingness to allow anyone else to do anything. I have one of those 100 percent full-blooded Italian moms who invites you over for dinner and does everything short of cutting your food and chewing it for you. Every pre-dinner exchange goes like this:\n\nCan we bring anything?\n\nNo.\n\nCan we help in any way?\n\nNo.\n\nCan I put salt on my food?\n\nNo.\n\nCan I pour my own wine?\n\nNo.\n\nThat’s Westbrook this season. He took 370 more shots than anyone else. He missed nearly 14 shots a game. He shattered the usage rate record (41.7%) and almost shattered the assist percentage rate (57.3%), a level of ball-hoggery that has no track record of ever translating to real NBA success (as covered in my Westbrook column last month). And yet, his night-to-night relentlessness was unlike anything that’s ever happened in the league. Who played harder for six straight months than Russell Westbrook just did? Did you ever see Russ tired? Did you ever see him sweat? Did you ever see him breathing heavily? Have you ever seen a basketball star with a bottomless stamina tank? This wasn’t an MVP season; this was performance art. Russell Westbrook gave more shits than anyone in the history of shits.\n\nAnd look, there’s barely any difference between Westbrook’s 32–11–10 and Harden’s 29–11–8. (I’d rather have the 29–11–8 and 400 more shots going to everyone else.) But the maniacal night-to-night drive that propelled Westbrook into the Oscar Club? Forty-two triple-doubles in 81 games? All those rebounds? All those times he went coast-to-coast, bounced off dudes like Zeke Elliott and finished in traffic? All those clutch shots when his legs should have been dead? I’ve never seen anything like it. Could LeBron match that passion for any 48-minute game? Fuck yeah. But for 82 games? No way. With 14 years of NBA miles on him, he couldn’t even do it for a month. LeBron wins Question 2, but Westbrook kind of wins it too.\n\nQuestion 3: If you’re explaining your MVP pick to someone who has a favorite player in the race — and your pick was a different player — will he/she at least say something like, “Yeah, I don’t like it, but I see how you arrived at that choice”?\n\nAnyone with half a basketball brain sees the cases for Kawhi, Harden and Westbrook. But if any Spurs, Rockets or Thunder fan heard a LeBron pick, they’d immediately shriek, “They went 23–23 in their last 46! He had Kyrie and Love on his team! He won only four more games than Russ!” Cross the King off. Stick him in fourth place. By the way, LeBron averaged 26–9–9, shot 55 percent and locked himself into another First-Team All-NBA selection and top-five MVP vote, which means he has the following streaks going:\n\n1. Six straight Finals, with maybe a seventh coming\n\n2. Twelve straight top-five MVP seasons\n\n3. Ten straight First-Team All-NBAs\n\n4. Thirteen straight seasons averaging at least a 25–6–6\n\n5. He’s still averaging a 27–7–7 with 50.1% shooting … FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER.\n\nDon’t shed any tears for LeBron’s inevitable fourth-place MVP finish. He’s fine. But if there were ever a season for LeBron to steal one last MVP trophy and pull even with MJ, this was the one. He won’t ever get this close again, not unless he goes Lance Armstrong on us. If Maverick Carter starts flying to Germany every week this summer to allegedly raise funding for Space Jam 2, we’ll know something’s up.\n\n(Getty Images)\nQuestion 4: Ten years from now, who will be the first player from that season who pops into my head? (Every season belongs to someone to varying degrees.)\n\nThe case for Kawhi: wins, efficiency, two-way play at the highest of levels. He’s the NBA’s third-best defensive player AND the league’s sixth-best offensive player AND everyone’s pick if we needed one defender to stop any great scorer in the last minute of any playoff game.\n\nThe case against Kawhi: The 2016–17 season belonged to Westbrook’s triple-double chase and the Durant-Russ feud, then the Warriors, then Harden and Moreyball, then the overflowing batch of explosive guards (Curry, Thomas, Wall, Lillard, Kyrie, etc.), then the unicorns (Giannis, Jokic, Porzingis, Embiid, maybe Towns), then LeBron’s bizarre Cavs season, then Tankapalooza 2017 … and maybe THEN you’d remember Kawhi and the Spurs? He would own the NBA season less than any MVP I can ever remember. Just for fun, here’s “who owned the season” in the 21st century.\n\n2000: Shaq (MVP), then C-Webb/Kings2001: Iverson (MVP), then Peak Shaqobe2002: Duncan (MVP), then Kidd/Nets, then C-Webb/Kings2003: Duncan (MVP), then T-Mac’s monster season2004: Garnett (MVP), then the bizarre Lakers (and Kobe’s trial)2005: Nash (MVP), then Shaq/Miami, then the Artest melee2006: Kobe, then Nash (MVP), then Dirk/Mavs2007: Nash/Suns, then Dirk (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs2008: KG/Celts, then Kobe (MVP), then CP3, then T-Mac/Houston2009: LeBron (MVP), then Kobe/Lakers2010: LeBron (MVP), then Kobe/L.A., then Nash/Suns2011: Rose (MVP), then LeBron/Wade/Bosh2012: LeBron (MVP), then Lob City, then Durant/OKC, then Boston’s last stand2013: LeBron (MVP), then the Harden trade2014: Durant (MVP), then LeBron/Miami, then Duncan/Spurs2015: Curry (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs, then Harden, then Westbrook2016: Curry (MVP), then LeBron/Cavs, then Durant/Westbrook\n\nYou could glance at any of those names and say, “Oh yeah, that’s when [blank] happened.” That’s happening with MVP Kawhi and the 2017 Spurs? Come on. I spent the past week trying to talk myself into him — because of San Antonio’s success, and because they’d never have anyone chase an MVP award like Westbrook did (and, to a lesser degree, like Harden did). But I couldn’t get there. It’s my own fault. I want my MVP to stand out in some uniquely impactful way. It’s not baseball. It’s not the Advanced Metrics Award. There’s a performance art/water cooler/alpha dog wrinkle that Kawhi just never offered, mainly because the Pop Machine would never want him to have it. He’s my third-place MVP pick.\n\nSpoiler alert: I’m not voting for Westbrook, either. Was Russ the FUN pick? Absolutely. Did he own the season? Absolutely — he won Question No. 4. But he wasn’t playing for the 2001 Sixers; he didn’t have to do absolutely everything at the expense of never developing/nurturing/testing anyone else.\n\nRemember when we came out of the 2016 playoffs raving about how much we liked Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, and Andre Roberson? Why didn’t they get any better? Why wasn’t Adams as devastating in OKC as the Capela-Nene-Harrell trio was for Houston? Why wasn’t Oladipo BETTER on a much better team? Why did they dump Ersan Ilyasova after only three games, and why wasn’t it a bigger deal when he thrived in Philly and Atlanta? Why such a wasted rookie year for Domantas Sabonis? Everyone acts like Russ is playing with the Washington Generals — he has two top-three lottery picks and three other lottery picks in their playing rotation. Kanter and Oladipo have near-max deals. Adams has a nine-figure deal coming. Ilyasova scored 15 a night on Philadelphia. Those guys sucked? If a superstar guarantees you 45 wins, then Westbrook dragged them to … 47 wins? What?\n\nMeanwhile, the Rockets were pegged as a fringe playoff team with only one All-Star and even lower expectations than OKC. And we didn’t know what to expect with Harden. After he finished second in the 2015 MVP voting, the Dwightbola virus turned him into a smoke-and-mirrors superstar last season. Why didn’t it seem like he cared? Was he turning into a glorified DH? This year, a rejuvenated Harden grabbed the point guard reins (why doesn’t he get more credit for switching positions, by the way?), made a bunch of role players better and transformed the Rockets into the league’s second-best offense. And not just that — they finished with one of the TEN BEST REGULAR-SEASON OFFENSES OF All TIME. (Here, look.)\n\n(Getty Images)\nDid Harden resonate as a performer like Westbrook did? Of course not. How do you compete with the NBA’s John Wick? Just don’t sleep on Harden’s magical passing, his Ginobili 2.0 slash-and-kick game, his famous Eurosteps, his surreal ability to find open shooters from every conceivable angle, his heat-check 3s, his occasional WTF box scores (an MVP staple), his annoyingly effective tactic of leaping suddenly into off-balance defenders for fake 3s (he’s the master at getting those calls), and his herky-jerky southpaw game that’s basically a one of one. You’d defend Russ by playing off him and hoping he jacks up 3s. You’d have no idea how to defend Harden. He’s just as durable as Westbrook, he’s almost as relentless and he’s even more dangerous because he uses everyone else on his team.\n\nAnd if you plugged this Harden season into a normal NBA year, when we weren’t obsessing over feuds, triple-doubles, body language, an endless barrage of 50-point games and everything else? We would have run out of ways to write Harden-D’Antoni comeback pieces two months ago. They figured out a better way to do Nash’s Suns while nearly reenacting Tiny Archibald’s legendary points-assists season? What???? But in that crowded 2017 landscape, Harden’s mega-season has yielded only some kudos, Chris Ryan’s Oscar contender Moreyball and that’s it.\n\nI loved watching Westbrook this season. Repeat: I loved it. I never imagined we’d see a Big O/triple-double sequel, just like I never imagined that Kobe could average 35 a game, or that Ron Artest could fight an entire section of Pistons fans without getting shanked. But if it’s down to Harden and Westbrook, and both sides are relatively equal, and we’re voting on offensive impact and team success over everything else and that breakdown comes down to this …\n\n47 wins, 17th-ranked offense, zero chance of winning the title\n\n55 wins, second-ranked offense (10th all time), puncher’s chance of winning the title\n\n… I mean, what are we arguing about? And why the hell did it take me so long? I’m picking James Harden.\n",

          "description": "The natural state of the artist is one of bitterness and incredulous jealousy. How on earth can Scott Adams prosper when Dilbert looks as if it’s drawn by a near-sighted warthog? Why does Thomas Friedman have a platform at the New York Times, when I could write bland, self-aggrandizing piffle just as well, and in a punchier prose style? Michelangelo insulted Leonardo Da Vinci in public for not finishing a statue; Remy Ma dissed Nicki Minaj, and vice versa; Richard Ford literally spit on Colson Whitehead at a party in retaliation for a poor book review. Artists are incredibly competitive; if someone else is succeeding, they think, “That person is getting more credit than they deserve, and I am not getting enough.”\n\nOf course, this isn’t true of all artists. But it is more likely to be true of those who believe that success is a meritocracy. If recognition is linked to artistic quality, you’re more likely to be angry when your own merit is not being recognized and celebrated. There’s just one problem: meritocracy is not how creative success—or really, most professional success—actually works.\n\nFor the most part, creative success has little to do with talent or hard work. Lots of people are talented and hard-working. Talented and hard-working people are nothing special, for better or worse. To be successful, you need more than just talent and hard work. You need luck. Or, even better than luck, you need connections.\n\nAnd yet artists persist in the belief that their success, or lack thereof, reveals something deeper about their worth. Writing in The Guardian, an anonymous author and self-proclaimed failed novelist recently published a mournfully angry piece about their lack of success. “I … avoid literary debuts by British female writers, which all seem so safe and samey,” the writer declared. “I feel pity and scorn for people with dreams.” In a follow-up piece, novelist David Barnett responded with scorn, albeit not with pity. “Dear Anonymous, you’re not a failure. You’re a quitter.” Bennett goes on, with sententious enthusiasm, “I failed over and over again; but each time, I failed better.”\n\nBoth writers are making the same error: They assume that failure and success are signals of artistic merit. The anonymous writer thinks they’ve failed because they doesn’t write “safe, samey” fiction; they’re too daring to get a book deal. Barnett thinks the anonymous writer has failed because they haven’t tried hard enough. Both attitudes lead to self-aggrandizement, and a lack of respect—or compassion—for others’ experiences.\n\nBut success is more of a structural than individual feat. Consider Sofia Coppola. There are hardly any female directors in Hollywood; the number of women filmmakers actually dropped in recent years. Coppola, whose dad is one of the most acclaimed and successful filmmakers in the history of cinema, is one of the few exceptions. Her connections helped her overcome systemic bias. That’s not a comment on Sofia Coppola’s talent one way or the other. It’s a simple acknowledgment that privilege and connections matter a lot—even more so when you’re dealing with a system that’s inherently biased against you.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that success is often a matter of being in the right place at the right time. One 2006 sociological study of music downloads found that people were much more likely to listen to a song that they were told was already popular. Economist Alan Krueger has pointed out that this means that success snowballs, regardless of talent.\n\nPopularity is its own logic, mostly divorced from questions of quality. This means that people with money can game the system; if you spend enough on marketing, millions of people will see Batman vs. Superman, no matter how turgid and confused it is. It also means that timing, and what other art happens to be released at the same time, can have a huge effect on success. “The difference between a Sugar Man, a Dylan and a Post Break Tragedy depends a lot more on luck than is commonly acknowledged,” Krueger concluded.\n\nIf creative success is a crapshoot, how should we feel about it? On one hand, it’s depressing. The fact that you’re more likely to succeed if you’re rich, or white, or a man, is inherently unjust, and perpetuates further injustice. And it’s disheartening to realize that luck can matter more than talent. You can be brilliant; you can work from sun-up to sun-down. Yet you may be forced to watch from the sidelines as others receive the recognition that is never coming your way.\n\nBut freeing yourself from the myth of meritocracy can also be liberating. If you fail, it’s not your fault. And if you succeed, it’s not because you’re better than everybody else. Your unique genius has neither doomed you to obscurity, nor elevated you to the heights.\n\nWhen we stop seeing professional success as a measure of our worth, we’re in a much better position to be kind—both to ourselves and to each other. Economist Robert H. Frank at the Atlantic has pointed out that when people believe they have succeeded through hard work rather than luck, they tend to be less open to helping others. Conversely, when people understand the role that luck has played in their achievements, they are more sympathetic to the struggles of others, and more likely to act with generosity.\n\nCreative success is not an exercise in social Darwinism. We don’t need to go out there and tear down other artists in order to advance ourselves. Once we recognize that, we can stop alternating between self-loathing and free-ranging resentment, and start focusing criticism at real injustices—like lack of health care, old boy’s networks, white supremacy, and other systems that make art less rewarding and more unjust. Once you stop believing in meritocracy, solidarity gets a lot easier.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.\n\nMost Popular\n",

          "description": "There are many ways to boost your account balances in this hobby, like making purchases through online shopping portals or using the right card for different bonus categories. However, one of the quickest ways to rack up points and miles is through sign-up bonuses on top travel rewards credit cards. Last month, we shared a new offer on The Platinum Card from American Express, allowing you to earn 60,000 Membership Rewards points after you use your new card to make $5,000 in purchases in your first three months. Today I want to go through some great ways to use these points for your next trip.\n\nAs you’ll see from the options that follow, each one involves transferring your Membership Rewards points to an airline partner and then redeeming the miles through that program. While the program does allow for many direct redemptions (including Amazon.com and Uber rides), you tend to get maximum value through partner programs. This valuable flexibility is one of the main reasons why every traveler should earn transferable points in at least one of the major programs.\n\nKeep in mind too that this list is just a sample of different options that may appeal to a wide swath of readers. Every traveler has his or her own way of determining what makes a “valuable” redemption, so be sure to explore additional rewards if the list below doesn’t appeal to you.\n\nSo, that being said, what are some of the best ways to redeem 60,000 Membership Rewards points? In no particular order:\n\n1. Two round-trip economy tickets from the US to Hawaii on Delta\n\nIf you’re looking to get to the Hawaiian Islands for (almost) free, consider transferring your Membership Rewards points to Flying Blue, the loyalty program of Air France, KLM and several other other carriers. The program only charges you 15,000 miles per person each way, regardless of your US departure gateway. As a result, you could fly from New York-JFK to Honolulu and back with your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse/family member for just 60,000 points. Availability is decent, especially if you’re flexible with departure and return dates, and you can get some tremendous value out of this type of redemption.\n\nHere’s a sample of round-trip flights with award availability at the time of writing:\n\nThese same flights could be yours for just 60,000 miles plus minimal taxes and fees, giving you a value of over 3 cents per mile.\n\n2. One-way business-class flight to Europe or Asia on American Airlines\n\nAnother great program to which you can transfer your Membership Rewards points is Etihad Guest, one that was just added as a partner back in 2016. The program has a number of redemption sweet spots, but one of my favorite is on American. This is due to the fact that, as of the time of writing, Etihad is still using a pre-devaluation award chart for flights on American. That means the following:\n\nOne-way business-class tickets to Europe are just 50,000 miles (57,500 if booked through American)\n\nOne-way business-class tickets to Asia 1 (Japan and Korea) are just 50,000 miles (60,000 if booked through American)\n\nOne-way business-class tickets to Asia 2 (Hong Kong and China) are just 55,000 miles (70,000 if booked through American)\n\nOf course, the big trick is finding award availability on these flights, as I’ve noticed that American has become much stingier with award space over the last several months, especially in premium classes. I’m a big fan of ExpertFlyer to help with this search, as it will allow you to set alerts for award seats on specific flights.\n\n3. One-way business-class flight to Europe on any Star Alliance carrier\n\nYou could enjoy a one-way business-class flight to Europe on a Star Alliance carrier like Lufthansa with this sign-up bonus.\nIf you’d rather have more flexibility when it comes to choosing your carrier and/or routing to Europe, consider transferring your Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan, the loyalty program of Air Canada. You’ll be able to redeem either 55,000 or 57,500 miles for a one-way business-class ticket to or from Europe (depending on exactly where in Europe you’re arriving into or departing from). Most importantly, there are several airlines with flights from the US to Europe, including Austrian (check out JT Genter’s review from last month), Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. You’ll need to pay some fuel surcharges on these flights, but the comfort of crossing the Atlantic in business class can make this more than worthwhile.\n\n4. At least 10 one-way flights of 650 miles or less on Oneworld carriers outside North America\n\nA fourth great target for your Membership Rewards points is British Airways. While the transfer ratio was devalued back in 2015 (now 250 points = 200 Avios), the carrier’s Executive Club program offers some very attractive redemption options thanks to its distance-based award chart. For example, a one-way flight covering 650 miles or less is just 4,500 Avios (or 4,000 if you’re traveling off-peak). This is a fantastic option for traveling into or out of Oneworld hub airport like London-Heathrow or Tokyo-Narita. Just remember that as of February of last year, you can’t redeem 4,500 Avios on flights in North America.\n\nEven though 60,000 Membership Rewards points will only get you 48,000 Avios, that’s still enough for 10 one-way flights at 4,500 Avios apiece or 12 one-way flights at the lower off-peak rate.\n\n5. One-way business-class flight from Singapore to Australia or New Zealand\n\nThis sign-up bonus could get you a flight in Singapore Airlines business class.\nIf you’ve been wanting to try out one of Singapore Airlines’ renowned premium classes, consider transferring your Membership Rewards points to the KrisFlyer program and booking a one-way flight in business class between Singapore and Australia or New Zealand. The carrier flies into numerous airports, including Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland. Each of these flights will set you back just 58,000 miles for several hours of bliss aboard the one of the airline’s long-haul aircraft. If there’s no availability on your preferred date, you can always waitlist for the award, though keep in mind that the carrier did increase redemption rates and remove the online booking discount last month. Nevertheless, there’s still some solid value to be had from the program!\n\nOther Considerations\n\nKeep in mind that all of the above options are just a sampling of what you can do with American Express Membership Rewards points given the new sign-up bonus on the Amex Platinum. Your balance can be even higher if you utilize the card’s newly increased bonus categories, like 5x points on airfare. You also may already have a stash of points from other cards like the Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express or the Amex EveryDay Preferred Credit Card from American Express.\n\nThe newly enhanced Platinum Card carries a number of nice perks beyond the increased sign-up bonus.\nIn addition, the card provides many additional benefits beyond the sign-up bonus that make it worthwhile beyond just the first year. You’ll be able to access luxurious American Express Centurion lounges and enjoy Priority Pass Select membership, and you can also visit Delta Sky Clubs when you’re traveling on a Delta-operated flight. The card also comes with a $200 annual airline fee credit that is automatically applied toward incidental purchases with a carrier you designate. The newest sets of perks include a new metal design and $200 in ride credits with Uber, though these enhancements did come along with an annual fee increase from $450 to $550.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe battle among the premium travel rewards credit cards is heating up, with the Platinum Card delivering the latest salvo by Amex enhancing the card’s suite of benefits and announcing a new sign-up bonus of 60,000 Membership Rewards points after you use your new card to make $5,000 in purchases in your first three months. There are many ways to make the most of these points for your next trip, and hopefully this post has given you some inspiration for how to put them to good use!\n\nHow would you redeem 60,000 Membership Rewards points?\n",

          "description": "Uber’s latest regulatory roadblock happens to be the entire country of Italy. In a court ruling issued today, all of Uber’s services were banned in the European country after a Rome judge ruled in favor of Italy’s major taxi associations that the ride-hailing service amounted to unfair competition, according to a report from Reuters. That means Uber’s Black, Lux, Suv, X , XL, Select, and Van services are all blocked from operating in Italy and Uber cannot advertise at all in the country. \n\nUber says it’s “shocked” by the ruling\n\n“We’re shocked,” Uber’s lawyers said in a statement obtained by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. “We will appeal this ruling that is based on a 25-year-old law. Now the government can’t waste more time and needs to decide whether it wants to remain anchored to the past, protecting privileged profits, or whether it wants to allow Italian to benefit from new technologies.” \n\nThe lawyers for Italy’s top taxi associations were a bit more celebratory. ““This is the fourth ruling by an Italian judge that ascertains Uber’s unfair competition, the latest battle in a legal war that began in 2015 to stop the most striking form of unfair competition ever registered on the Italian local public transportation market,” the lawyers told Corriere della Sera. \n\nUber plans to appeal the ruling. It has 10 days to do either that or cease operating its service in Italy. If it does neither, it faces fines up to $10,600 for every day it continues operating illegally. The news ends another rather rough week for Uber, as the company continues sustaining bad press over its treatment of drivers and female employees and remains stuck in a high-profile legal battle over trade secret theft with Alphabet’s Waymo division. \n",

          "description": "One of my regrets in life — not one of the main ones, like opening a credit card specifically to finance a spontaneous trip to E.B. White’s rural estate — is never taking the time to watch a Fast & the Furious movie. Who could have guessed that these seemingly chauvinist, boring movies about street racing and close-ups of butt cheeks would eventually become a beloved cinematic tradition about family, family, family, and hilarious naming conventions? \n\nWho could have guessed that The Fate of the Furious would someday be a movie I would want very much to watch, but would feel excluded from due to my utter lack of context? Not me! \n\nwho has time to watch seven movies?\n\nYet here we are, and the folks at Burger Fiction, the one good YouTube supercut channel, have put together a seven-minute explanation of the furious evolution of Fast & the Furious to help me out. Over 16 years and seven (going on eight) films, the franchise appears to have gone from absurd to more absurd, and then heartfelt and absurd. I love it, I think. \n\nSorry if I’m late to this (I am), but “I take the cash and I take the respect” is a good catchphrase. Cool with everyone if I start using it? On the other hand, “I live my life a quarter-mile at a time” is not a good catchphrase. It’s irresponsible, and a brag about endangering the lives of others. But I like most of the improbable things I saw happening in this supercut, especially where the Rock busts himself out of a restrictive arm cast that was presumably there for his safety and healing. Live on the edge! \n\nAnyway, now I’m all caught up. I can’t wait to see a car movie with my friends, who I sometimes refer to as... family. \n\nNote: In April 2015 The Verge made a similar and, I would cautiously say, better video about Furious films one through six. I didn’t work here yet, and I missed it. It’s too late to go back now, in my opinion, but if you want to watch it to get double the furious, here it is:\n",

          "description": "Zara and H&M are the world’s two largest fashion brands. Not by coincidence, they’re also the pioneers of fast fashion. Zara is able to take a coat from design to the sales floor in 25 days (paywall), and it can replenish items even more quickly.\n\nIn the past couple of decades, the two companies have steadily trounced much of their competition, outdoing them on price and speed to claim an ever-larger share of shoppers’ spending. But both are being beat at their own game by even faster competitors.\n\nBritish fashion retailers ASOS and Boohoo are both able to design, produce, and have clothing ready for shoppers on the sales floor quicker than Zara and H&M, according to a research note Goldman Sachs sent investors last month, and the two millennial-focused, social-media savvy brands are enjoying the rewards. On April 4, ASOS lifted its sales forecast for the year, expecting sales to grow between 30% and 35%. Boohoo also recently raised (pdf) its earnings forecast, predicting sales growth of around 50% for the year. Unbeknownst to many, its shares rose more in 2016 than those of any other Western European consumer-related company with a market capitalization of more than $500 million.\n\nGoldman Sachs charted the correlation between supply-chain lead times and like-for-like (LFL) sales growth, and the results show just how much speed matters. It allows brands to respond to the market quickly, which means they can adjust their inventory to match trends as they happen, and it keeps them from having to produce a large amount of stock in advance that then risks not selling and being discounted.\n\nSpeed wins. (Screen capture of Goldman Sachs note to investors)\n\nIt helps that both ASOS and Boohoo are online retailers, meaning they—unlike many of their fashion rivals—aren’t suffering from an overabundance of brick-and-mortar stores whose sales are being cannibalized by ecommerce. (Zara and H&M, after years of rapidly expanding, have recently announced plans to ease back on their rate of opening new stores to shift focus online.) And while both ASOS and Boohoo are starting from a smaller sales base, making it easier to achieve high growth, the analysts at Goldman Sachs still argue that their roughly “four-week design-to-store model is integral to their success.”\n\n Defiant by nature. Jeans by ASOS. Express yourself with colourful denim for SS17 – in badass bleaching or super-sweet pastel hues. Your blue jean babies have had their colour done – this is acid wash reloaded. Cos you've never let a little thing like a rulebook stand in your way. #JeansByASOS\n\nA post shared by ASOS (@asos) on Apr 3, 2017 at 1:24am PDT\n\nH&M is aware it’s falling behind, announcing plans recently to invest in and rethink its supply chain. Most of its manufacturing takes place in Asia in order to keep prices down, but it’s considering moving more production closer to Europe, to countries such as Turkey, which would let it get items to stores more quickly. That proximity is key to the speed of its faster rivals. (Even Japanese retailer Uniqlo, which emphasizes that it isn’t driven by trends, has acknowledged that it needs to speed up.)\n\n Ultimate BABE  ( @sofiajamora) #myboohoostyle #boohooontheroad #dzz61170\n\nA post shared by boohoo.com (@boohoo) on Apr 2, 2017 at 7:02am PDT\n\nBoth Zara and H&M saw a slowdown in sales growth this year, and their margins are also under pressure, leading some to wonder whether the fast-fashion industry is crumbling under the same forces as other retailers. On the contrary, it’s getting even faster.",

          "description": "The March Bon Appetit’s “Dinner Tonight” column features a spread of recipes by chef Alex Raij. As the owner of four restaurants and mother of two, Alex says her secret to getting dinner on the table is improvisation—grabbing this and grabbing that, working with what she has on hand. She also reveals her secret for succulent chicken thighs: “Humble mayonnaise, which encourages browning.”\n\nI see minimal prep in your future...\nPhoto by Alexandra Stafford\n\nHaving had success with mayonnaise in surprising applications in the past—Gabrielle Hamilton’s genius grilled cheese and chocolate chicory cake, for instance—I needed no more convincing to make Alex’s mayonnaise-slicked chicken. The recipe at its core, moreover, looked simple: Toss potatoes with sliced onion, oil, and water in a roasting pan. Place bone-in, skin-on, mayonnaise-coated (and -marinated, if time permits) chicken thighs on top. Roast at 450º F until the chicken is lightly charred and cooked through.\n\nFor the amount of prep, which amounts to slicing an onion and stirring together two condiments, I’m not sure I’ve ever reaped such a great reward: exceptionally tender chicken and incredibly tasty potatoes flavored with the juices of the meat, the sweet, meltingly tender onions, and the olive oil. I’ve made the dish several times now with a few modifications to account for the ingredients I’ve had on hand and time limitations—not once have I marinated this chicken, and not once has it received anything but rave reviews.\n\nFrom tarragon-y to oven ready...\nPhotos by Alexandra Stafford\n\nThese are the keys to success here:\n\n1. Use smallish potatoes, ideally ones that require no chopping. Small fingerlings (or halved large ones) will work, as will new potatoes or whatever you can find at your market—I’ve been using honey golds. A small potato not only minimizes prep but also ensures it will cook completely through by the time the chicken is done.\n\n2. Monitor the water level: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to add water to prevent the onions from getting too brown. See notes in the recipe.\n\n3. Finish with herbs: Nothing says spring like tarragon! A showering of fresh herbs—chives, tarragon, parsley, or whatever you like best—just before serving brightens this dish up both color- and flavor-wise.\n\nEffortless chic is a good look.\nPhoto by Alexandra Stafford\n\nI know mayonnaise, for some people, can be a hard sell, but before the inclusion of this ingredient turns you away, first consider what mayonnaise is: an emulsion of oil and egg often with a little lemon or vinegar. It’s harmless! If that’s not enough, know that whatever it is about mayonnaise that offends you—its smell, texture, appearance—dissipates in the oven. And if that’s not enough still, let the promise of a five-minute dinner prep show you the light—the result, I have no doubt, will make mayonnaise a page turner in your book no longer.\n\nOne-Pan Roasted Chicken Thighs with Potatoes and Tarragon\n\nBy Alexandra Stafford\n\n1.5\npounds small potatoes, see notes above\n\n1\nmedium onion, thinly sliced, to yield about a cup\n\n2\ntablespoons olive oil\n\n1/2\ncup water\n\nkosher salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste\n\n1/4\ncup mayonnaise\n\n2\ntablespoons Dijon mustard\n\n4\nbone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n\na few tablespoons finely chopped herbs, such as tarragon, chives, or parsley\n\nView Full Recipe",

The chart above is getting a bunch of attention on social media; teens aged 13-17 were asked to rank a bunch of brands according to how cool they think they are. Since the poll was commissioned by Google (and the results published by an internal marketing team), it’s unsurprising that three Google brands (YouTube, Google, Chrome) are in the top 10. Other interesting data points:\n\n- Teens don’t know what Zara and Uniqlo are. Or Supreme.\n\n- Buzzfeed is only slightly cooler than Ford and Chevrolet, which are both cooler than HBO. Perhaps because HBO can’t get you to a party and you can’t make out in a Buzzfeed?\n\n- Kraft is cooler than Red Bull.\n\n- Whatsapp, TMZ, Vice, and Yahoo are all super uncool.\n\n- Twitter is cooler than Facebook, but Snapchat is much cooler than both.\n\n- The Wall Street Journal is the least cool thing in the teen universe.\n\n- This tweet is a good reminder not to take any of this too seriously.\n\nThere’s also this curious sentence in the introduction about Generation Z:\n\nUnlike millennials, this group is ambitious, engaged, and feel like they can change the world.\n\nOuch. In what universe is that even a remotely true or fair statement?\n\nTags: Google",

          "description": "The world of fashion is filled with comings and goings. Nowadays, it’s common for a creative director to spend a few years with one label, before moving on to another. Who’s designing at Dior now? And what of Valentino? For everyday American women—even those who love to get dressed—the answer isn’t relevant.\n\nBut most could name the creative force behind J.Crew: Jenna Lyons. Which is why yesterday, when my phone dinged with a message from a colleague: “Did you see this?” and a link to the news that Lyons would be leaving J.Crew, after 26 years rising through the company’s ranks to the role of president and creative director—second only to CEO Mickey Drexler—it felt, almost laughably, like a moment I might look back on: “Where were you when you found out Jenna was leaving?” (I was, no kidding, at the Trevi Fountain in Rome, wearing my navy J.Crew menswear-style wool jacket. This brand is always with us.)\n\nJenna Lyons (center) for years was the face of J.Crew.\n\nJ.Crew is a company that many people, myself included, feel a deeply personal connection with. As a high-schooler in St. Louis, MO in the 1990s, I would wait for the catalogue and turn down the corners of pages showing the barn jackets, rugby shirts, and roll-neck sweaters I longed for. Twenty years later, I repeatedly lamented that a favorite piece from that era—a simple, scoopback one-piece swimsuit—was impossible to find. At the time, J.Crew was making headlines by directly responding to customer feedback, and my editor at The Cut encouraged me to write an open letter to Lyons. The Cut published my letter, and Lyons’ reply landed swiftly in my inbox, alluding to a possible return of the style the following summer: “I really do appreciate your letter—could never have described that swimsuit better and it is a great reminder to us all that we still have some relics from our past collections that are worth revisiting.”\n\nThe following summer, the swimsuit was resurrected, with fanfare. The outpouring of tweets, emails, and texts I received from gushing and grateful fellow fans of the scoop-back tank suit was overwhelming. Jenna Lyons made me a hero. (Truth told, I suspect she might have had plans to resurrect that swimsuit regardless.)\n\nIt was my first glimpse behind the scenes at Jenna Lyon’s J.Crew—a place more progressive, playful, and fashion-forward than the J.Crew of my childhood, though its preppy spirit remained very much intact. I returned there last February, when I was invited to participate in a cast of non-professional models in the brand’s Fall 2017 show. A few days before, I arrived to J.Crew’s offices for my fitting. There, I found oldies piping through the speakers, and racks upon racks of rainbow-ordered tweeds, furs, sweaters, and plaids.\n\nMy outfit—or “look,” in industry parlance—had already been selected and hung waiting for me: medium-wash blue jeans, a striped wrap blouse, a slate velvet blazer, and a vibrant red wool coat. I put it all on, and Somsack Sikhounmuong—then head of womenswear, and now the chief design officer—and Gayle Spannaus, J.Crew’s longtime superstar stylist, worked in tandem with Lyons. I was drowning in layers, so I first removed the red coat. Wrong move; Lyons could see we needed the color. The blazer came off, and when I went to put my arm through the red coat’s sleeve, Lyons stopped me and tossed it over my shoulders instead. A silk foulard scarf appeared, and I stepped into a pair of plaid block heels. Spannaus advised skipping a bra come show day: It’s better to see a human breast than a bra, she said. Lyons told me not to bother with a manicure.\n\n“We want you to look like you,” she said, snugging the coat around my shoulders.\n\nOne could easily see Lyons’ departure as the end of an era. But the mark she left goes far beyond J.Crew, or even fashion. Jenna Lyons’ impact is about style and attitude as much as it is about clothing. To watch her work—or to read about it—is to see the way she empowers those around her, whether by making the resurrection of a classic swimsuit seem like it was your genius idea, or emboldening women to treat leopard spots as a neutral, menswear as womenswear, and pajamas as clothes.\n\nLyons will stay on at J.Crew as a creative advisor through the end of the year, but please let’s not eulogize the Jenna Lyons era of American fashion. As far as I’m concerned, it’s far from over. Lyons has left us with loads of lessons: Perfect is boring; socks and bras are overrated; stripes are underrated; if you’re super-formal on the bottom (ie: ballgown skirt) go more casual up top. And above all, getting dressed should be fun, and make you feel like you.\n\nI suspect Lyons’ very qualified cohorts at J.Crew will be channeling their “inner Jenna” for years to come—asking themselves “What would Jenna do?” (WWJD)—just as I did yesterday at a vintage store in Rome, when I fell in love with a lusciously soft wool checked blazer that was just a smidge too big for me.\n\nI pulled my arms out of the sleeves, and tossed it over my shoulders instead.\n",

          "description": "Bhagat Ram Talwar, later known as Silver, was the only quintuple spy in World War-II, working for the British, Russians, Germans, Italians, and the Japanese. Silver, who identified as a “Hindu Pathan,” was born and raised in the northwest region of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan. Unlike other spies, he shuttled between Kabul and India, traversing the tribal territories where Winston Churchill fought his first war. That experience would go on to establish the British prime minister’s opinions about Hindus and Muslims.\n\nLike Kipling, Winston Churchill, for whom Silver worked during the war, would also have been horrified by the thought that he was a Hindu. In 1945, after his return from Yalta, where Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin decided the post-war future of the world, the British Prime Minister had dinner with his Downing Street secretary, John Colville, and Arthur Harris, head of Bomber Command. Colville’s diary entry of 23 February 1945 records Churchill’s thoughts about the Hindus:\n\nThe PM said the Hindus were a foul race “protected by their mere pullulation from the doom that is their due” and he wished Bert Harris could send some of his surplus bombers to destroy them.\n\nThree years earlier Churchill had told Ivan Mikhailovich Maisky, the Soviet ambassador in London, that, should the British be forced to leave India:\n\nEventually, the Moslems will become master, because they are warriors, while the Hindus are windbags. Yes, windbags! Oh, of course, when it comes to fine speeches, skilfully balanced resolutions and legalistic castles in the air, the Hindus are real experts! They’re in their element! When it comes to business, when something must be decided on quickly, implemented, executed—here the Hindus say “pass”. Here they immediately reveal their internal flabbiness.\n\n[…]\n\nChurchill’s contrasting views of the Hindus and Muslims had been formed half a century before when he had fought his first war not far from where Silver was born. Churchill had taken part in what was called “a frontier war” with the British, putting down a rebellion by Pathans in the Swat Valley, now part of Pakistan. The war formed the subject of the first of his many books: The Story of the Malakand Field Force. The Hindus do not feature in the book and while Churchill is critical of the Muslims he admired their courage.\n\n[…]\n\nAs he gazed down on the destroyed Mohmand villages and their trampled crops, he found much to admire in the Muslims:\n\n… it would be unjust and ungenerous to deny to the people of the Mamund [the spelling then used] Valley, that reputation for courage, tactical skill and marksmen which they have so well deserved. During an indefinite period they had brawled and fought, in the unpenetrated gloom of barbarism. At length they struck a blow at civilisation, and civilisation will yet ungrudgingly admit that they are a brave and warlike race.\n\n[…]\n\nHad Churchill ever met Silver it is hard to see how he could ever have accepted he was really a Hindu.\n\nThe Indian Spy by Mihir Bose. (Aleph Book Company)\nChurchill’s sentiments regarding the brave Muslims were universally shared by British officials who got to know the region. Mountstuart Elphinstone, a classical scholar who led the first serious mission to Afghanistan in 1808, made no secret he preferred the Islamic faith over that of the superstitious Hindus and wrote, “They have also a degree of curiosity which is a relief habituated to the apathy of the Indian.” He went on to say, “I know of no people in Asia who have fewer vices or are less voluptuous or debauched.” For all the talk of the great civilising mission of imperial rule British officials were happy that none of this “brave and warlike race” wanted to be “civilised” or have anything to do with British education, let alone western values and ideas.\n\nFour years after Silver’s birth Beatrice Webb and her husband, Sidney Webb, visited Peshawar and recorded how the British officials saw the uneducated Muslim Pathans:\n\nWe are amused at the universal praise of the wild Pathans (Afridis and Afghans) of these parts. Everyone says they are fine fellows, far superior to the Hindoos! [then a common spelling for the Hindu]. We learn on cross-examination they are cruel and treacherous, shockingly addicted to unnatural vice and habitually given to stealing each other’s wives; that murder and robbery are so common as not to be deemed crimes; that the men do little work, leaving the agriculture and the care of their goats mostly to the women and boys; and that the only occupation considered worthy of manhood is the promiscuous shooting at each other, taken unawares, which they call war. When we ask why a people is admired which breaks nearly every Commandment, and is apparently of no earthly use in the universe, we are told they are fine manly fellows, ‘good sportsmen’, with a sense of humour! Verily our English standards are peculiar. The fact is that the British officer likes them because (1) they admire and respect him and his special qualities; (2) they make good soldiers under him; and (3) they in no way compete with him or ‘claim equality’, or excel in directions in which he feels himself deficient. When we ask a thoughtful Civilian whether he sees any reason to believe that, even in a couple of centuries, the Pathan will have developed into anything like a civilized people, or into anything else of use in the world, he is bound to admit that there is no sign of any such a Possibility.\n\nIn the 1930s Silver, as we shall see, played a part in helping a secular party get power in the North West Frontier, the first time and only time a secular party has ever exercised control in that part of the world. It was allied to the Congress, the main nationalist party in India. The Congress, though secular, was Hindu-dominated, not surprising since India is predominantly a Hindu country. And a bewildered Caroe wrote: “It is hard to see how the Pathan tradition could reconcile itself for so long to the Hindu leadership, by so many regarded as smooth-faced, pharisaical and double-dealing.”\n\nExcerpted with the permission of Aleph Book Company from the book The Indian Spy: The True Story of the Most Remarkable Secret Agent of World War II by Mihir Bose.

Lyons’s creative influence helped the brand become a US household name in the 2000s. She had been with the company since 1990, and rose quickly after Drexler joined as CEO in 2003. In the decade that followed, their partnership helped J.Crew triple its sales, and made fans including former US first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nLyons had a deft touch for giving J.Crew’s preppy staples a fashion-forward twist with energetic colors and creative styling. In 2010, she became the brand’s president, and has come to be a fashion celebrity with her own widely admired style.\n\nBut many of J.Crew’s formerly loyal customers believe the company strayed too far from its strengths, becoming too fashion-centric in its product offering and catalogue styling, at the expense of the wardrobe basics that made it a closet staple. Some have blamed Lyons—by name—though J.Crew also has had other problems, including customer allegations that the quality and fit of its products have deteriorated over the years.\n\nSales have now been falling for years, prompting the company to oust its head of women’s design in 2015—but not Lyons, which was somewhat unusual in the fashion industry. The company instead brought in Sikhounmuong, previously head designer at Madewell, J.Crew’s sister brand, which was enjoying the sort of success J.Crew has lately been seeking for itself.\n\nJ.Crew has also suffered from the problems plaguing US retail more broadly, including increasing competition from cheap fast-fashion competitors and an overabundance of brick-and-mortar stores. In its most recent fiscal year, reported on March 21, J.Crew sales fell 3%, while sales at stores open at least a year dropped 7%.\n\nSikhounmuong will now have the task of trying to turn the brand’s sales around. Lyons will remain a creative adviser to J.Crew through the end of the year, when her contract runs out. Her position will not be filled, the company said. Instead her duties will be shifted to other members of J.Crew’s executive team.\n",

How many clubs intend to deploy a flexible facsimile this spring? We asked.\n\n(Getty Images/Ringer illustration)\n\nBaseball has always been a numbers game, but players and teams are getting smarter than ever — and fans are, too. Throughout The Ringer’s 2017 MLB preview, in a series we’re calling “How to Baseball,” our experts will explore the developments that stand to change the way the game is played and consumed. We’ve never known more, and while knowledge is power, it’s also a wellspring of questions. We hope to answer some of them — and to remind you all to bunt wisely.\n\nThe more one reads about Indians fireman Andrew Miller, the more one suspects that being unselfish about saves, entering games at make-or-break moments, and alternating between warming up early or late must be the easy part of life as a precedent-setting reliever. The hard part is probably having to talk about the above.\n\nMiller’s unique usage as a shutdown, multi-inning arm straight out of the ’70s has made him a popular interview target for writers in search of baseball’s latest trends. When I was working on a story late last August about Miller’s work with Cleveland, an Indians PR person told me Miller wouldn’t be available to talk about his unorthodox usage because he’d already been asked about it so many times by local media members. (Instead, I talked to Terry Francona, who’d probably been asked just as often.) That was, again, in August, more than a month before the playoffs drew 10 times the attention to Miller’s exploits; we can only imagine how many more times Miller has been bombarded with bullpen questions since then. That’s the hidden cost of becoming a trailblazer: People want to talk to you, and every one of them wants a fresh quote on a stale subject.\n\nEarlier this month, Miller was quoted in a Nick Cafardo feature for the Boston Globe called, “Why Andrew Miller could represent the future of relief pitching.” At first, Miller downplays the idea thatbaseball may be “trending back toward the late-game, multi-inning relief ace,” calling the response to his playoff performance “a lot … made out of a little.” But then Cafardo coaxes a quote that seems to support the thesis.\n\n“I think we’re going to see the multiple-innings reliever,” Miller says. “I don’t know how long it will take, we might be five years away from the 40-appearance, 80-inning reliever or something like that, but I can see it happening.”\n\nCould it possibly be happening as soon as this spring? As Miller mentions to Cafardo, teams might have more success getting minor league bullpen guys to break free of their bonds than they would big leaguers with long-established routines. But the memory of Miller’s October run, and the urge to emulate it, will never be stronger than now.\n\nSince the workhorse ’70s, both innings pitched per relief appearance and the percentage of relief appearances lasting two innings or more have continued a decline that began immediately after baseball began, sinking most precipitously after the popularization of the Eckersley-La Russa cookie-cutter closer in the late ’80s and early ’90s.\n\nIn recent years, though, both rates have leveled off: Relievers have averaged about one inning per appearance, with roughly 10 percent of appearances lasting two-plus-innings. If Miller and Cafardo are right, that plateau could be a prelude to an upturn.\n\nBaseball’s go-to public stat providers haven’t processed spring training data in a way that would allow us to look for longer average outings this year than in spring trainings past, but there are some anecdotal indicators that suggest something afoot. On a podcast last week, Sun Sentinel Marlins beat writer Tim Healey told me and Jeff Sullivan that “unconventional use” of the bullpen is something Don Mattingly’s team “talked about throughout the offseason,” partly as a means of compensating for a thin starting staff. Healey also mentioned that the Marlins “see [David Phelps] as their Andrew Miller–type.” Which made me wonder: How many “Miller-types” are there?\n\nThe 20 Baseball Players You Need to Watch in 2017From Francisco Lindor to Manny Machado, these guys play the game the right way — the entertaining waytheringer.com\n\nTo find out, I surveyed one or more beat writers from each of the 28 other non-Indians teams and asked them if there’s a particular pitcher on the club that they cover who’s gotten buzz in camp about being a flexible, multi-inning reliever in the Miller mold — in role, if not necessarily results. (Miller’s stuff and stats are even rarer than his willingness to work without a predictable pattern.)\n\nThe table below contains the survey results. If the writer reported that the club does have at least one pitcher who’s likely to start the season in a Miller-like role, I listed him in the first column. If the team has a pitcher (or pitchers) who might eventually slide into a role that in some way mirrors Miller’s (in the writer’s estimation), I filled in the second column. If both columns are blank, either the team follows strict inning assignments or its bullpen is still too unsettled to say whether there’s a wannabe Miller lurking somewhere inside.\n\nThis table is just a snapshot of where teams stand as Opening Day approaches. Most teams’ bullpens will reshape themselves significantly over the next six months, as injuries strike, prospects are promoted, and pitchers excel or struggle. After all, when last season started, the only Andrew Miller on the Indians was the SVP of strategy and business analytics. The one we’ve been talking about was a conventional late-inning reliever closing (and subsequently setting up) for the Yankees.\n\nAll told, about a third of teams (including the Indians) have a pitcher who’s currently slated to approximate a Miller-like role, although not necessarily in direct response to Miller’s heroics last year.\n\nPhelps may be the most Miller-like of all, drawing explicit comparisons from Mattingly, who’s called him “kind of our Andrew Miller.” Pitching almost exclusively in relief last year, Phelps saw his velocity spike almost 3.5 mph, with a correspondingly large increase in strikeout rate. Although he averaged just barely more than an inning per appearance out of the pen, he entered games as early as the fourth and as late as the ninth. Mattingly has described his position on the 2017 team as a “defined, undefined role” in which his task could be “a couple innings, it could be closing a game out — anywhere in there depending on where our [bullpen is] at.” Although Phelps still hoped to rejoin the rotation last spring, he’s said that he’s content this time to reprise the role that Miller made sexy.\n\nThe Rebirth of Baseball’s Great CommunicatorCleveland’s Terry Francona is innovating — and eating — like never beforetheringer.com\n\nThe Astros’ Devenski is an actual example of the almost mythical 40-appearance, 80-inning reliever Miller invoked in his quote to Cafardo. Their origin stories don’t look much alike: Miller, a sixth overall draft pick, was once ranked the 10th-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America; Devenski, a 771st overall pick, never made a top 100 and was left unprotected in the Rule 5 draft. Yet as a 25-year-old rookie last season with no prior experience above Double-A, Devenski was one of the best pitchers in baseball on a per-inning basis. As Sullivan has observed, only Clayton Kershaw and Kyle Hendricks recorded better park- and league-adjusted ERAs.\n\nDevenski, who finished fourth in rookie of the year voting, made 43 appearances out of the pen, totaling 83.2 innings. That made him the first 40-something/80-something bullpen pitcher since White Sox reliever Tony Peña, a sub-replacement pitcher in 2010. Devenski ditched his curve for an increasingly nasty slider as the season wore on, and his fastball played up in the pen, where he’ll likely remain unless the Astros suffer enough injuries for him to be pressed into service as a starter.\n\nIt’s not only new blood getting in on the act. Shortly after the World Series ended — and days after a prescient Viva El Birdos blog post entitled “Trevor Rosenthal as Andrew Miller” — Cardinals manager Mike Matheny called deposed closer Trevor Rosenthal to tell him to prepare to stretch out for more extended outings, and GM John Mozeliak told Derrick Goold that “it makes sense to have people prepared to do more than just a one-inning stint.”\n\nNor is Miller-like experimentation limited to competitive teams. Union-Tribune Padres beat writer Dennis Lin says that Padres reliever Brad Hand “has been talked about” as a candidate to mimic the Miller role. Conveniently, Hand, who led all relievers in innings and appearances last season, throws a close replica of Miller’s slider. Meanwhile, the Reds came into camp with a long-gestating plan to use former starters Raisel Iglesias and Michael Lorenzen as “alternating, multi-inning closers” who’d pile up even more outings than Miller and Cleveland quasi-closer Cody Allen. The plan has hit some hurdles — Iglesias has missed much of March after falling in the shower, and Lorenzen has pitched poorly enough that he might wish he’d slipped too — but even if it doesn’t pan out, the Reds had the desire to do something different.\n\nIn Arlington, multiple innings are in the air, although there’s no designated fireman. “It seems like [Jeff] Banister is testing the waters on a lot of guys doing [the Miller role],” says Levi Weaver, who covers the Rangers for WFAA, via direct message. “It feels like it’s less making one guy that guy, and — aside from [Sam] Dyson — pushing that versatility aspect as a bullpen-wide trait.” Matt Bush and Keone Kela have had a few multiple-inning outings this spring, which leads Weaver to believe that is “something Banister is intrigued by.” Even Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who usually prefers rigid roles, has eschewed them this spring in favor of flexibility, although some of his multi-inning options — Bud Norris comes to mind — might not be great fits for even one inning of work. Meanwhile, in Washington, Blake Treinen could still be a conventional closer, but as The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes says, “I think if he isn’t the closer, it will be because they want to make him Miller-y.”\n\nIn some cases, perhaps, we’re seeing what we want or expect to: After Miller mania, anything out of the ordinary can look like revolution. As Miller told Cafardo, no pitcher could withstand the workload he endured in October (19.1 innings in 15 team games) over the full summer schedule, so a reversal of the long-term, league-wide trend in the regular season is likely to come slowly, if at all. Still, there are some stirrings on the bullpen flexibility front this spring. We’ll soon see whether they last long enough to move the major league needle.\n",

          "description": "We all know about the legendary Santorini sunsets or the epic parties on Mykonos, but what about the thousands of other Greek Islands out there? We’re not talking Crete, Rhodes or that stopover in Kos when you hopped off your cruise ship. Stunning beaches, authentic Greek culture and cuisine, fewer tourists and lower prices all await you in these lesser-known locales. Here are eight other Greek Islands you may not have heard of, but are still worth a visit.\n\n1. Symi\n\nIf you really want a taste of some local charm, head to Symi, part of the Dodecanese Islands. Each year between July and September, the island puts on a festival featuring parades, gastronomical events, open-air music, dancing, religious ceremonies and sporting events, among other activities. Symi is also known for sponge fishing and its colorful Neoclassical houses.\n\nThe colorful houses of Symi, Greece. Image courtesy of Scintella via Wikimedia Commons.\n2. Milos\n\nThe island for beach lovers, Milos (also referred to as Mylos), is part of the Cyclades group and is home to more than 70 beaches, with many tucked away in coves or between cliffs. Sarakiniko is one of the most well-known, thanks to its oddly-shaped giant rocks that were formed by volcanic activity — hidden between the rock formations is pure, white sand.\n\nSarakiniko Beach on the island of Milos.

Amorgos\n\nThe easternmost island of the Greek Cyclades, Amorgos is home to a special place that any history buff should come and see: The Monastery of Hozoviotissa. The religious edifice was built into a cliff overlooking the sea in the 11th century and views from the monastery, which overlooks the glittering blue sea, are nothing short of breathtaking. Keep in mind there’s a modest dress code if you wish to enter the monastery — like other European churches or when visiting Vatican City, knees and shoulders must be covered to show respect.\n\nThe Monastery of Hozoviotissa on Amorgos.

Also known as Leipsoi, this tiny island — just under five miles long — is located in a small group of islands near Patmos. Known for producing delicious local products like thyme honey, cheese and wine, the island offers plenty of tranquil coastline and beautiful churches and monasteries to visit. If you want to stick to eating clean while on vacation, Lipsi is the perfect island to reset your diet.\n\nThe harbor at Lipsi. Image courtesy of KF via Wikimedia Commons.\n5. Schinoussa\n\nSchinoussa (meaning “island of the sun”) is known as a nature sanctuary, as it hosts several local plant species and many birds. The island, which is barely more than three square miles, is part of the Lesser Cyclades group, but there’s nothing “lesser” about it. With 18 stunning beaches to visit and several hiking trails to tackle, it’s perfect for outdoorsy types. It’s also famous for its fava beans, figs and grapes. There are only two villages on the island, with less than 300 inhabitants between the two of them, so Schinoussa makes a great spot for a quiet, romantic getaway.\n\nChora, one of Schinoussa’s two villages.

Pyrgi, Chios\n\nNot to be confused with Pyrgi, Italy, this small village on the island of Chios offers an architectural experience unlike any other. Commonly known as the “painted village,” this medieval town’s buildings are covered with painted geometrics and artsy motifs in funky grey-and-white patterns. The technique is known as xysta, and uses cement, lime and volcanic sand. Thanks to its xysta-covered buildings (churches, apartments and shops, among other buildings), this village makes the island of Chios one of a kind.\n\nThe painted village of Pyrgi.

Ikaria\n\nIf you’re hoping to find the meaning of life during your vacation, you don’t have to go all Eat, Pray, Love and ashram it in India. Visiting the Greek island of Ikaria will definitely give you some solid insight into life, because its inhabitants live forever — well, maybe not forever, but still, longer than most. Locals attribute their longevity to all sorts of things the island offers, like a healthy Mediterranean diet full of fresh foods, daily walks and natural herbs that can be used for pretty much anything. Visitors to the island can learn about special herbs and teas and take a little bit of these life lessons home with them.\n\nApparently, Greek herbs can make you live (almost) forever.

This spot is perfect for eco-friendly travelers, as it’s home to the Natural Marine Park of Alonissos and is dedicated to protecting the monk seal. Also famous for its vineyards, this island is ideal if you’d like to spend your vacation doing a combination of wine tastings, nature walks and relaxing on pristine beaches.\n\nThe island of Alonissos.

          "description": "If a child is a fussy eater, there’s probably not one single reason why. It could be genes. It could be the subtle hints the child—or small baby—has learned by watching their family at the table. It could be the psychological connections that their parents have helped forge between certain foods and emotions. Then again, becoming choosy about what to eat is also a normal part of development—up to a point.\n\nBut when food selectivity feels severe, parents may worry they’re raising picky eaters who will still be subsisting on cheese pizza and Cheerios by the time they head to college. In extreme cases, the behavior could even be linked to a problem like depression or anxiety, or to another condition, like ADHD.\n\nBut there is hope, even for the pickiest of toddlers. Science has proven that it’s never too late for children (or adults, for that matter) to expand the variety of foods they consume and build a healthier long-lasting relationship with food. In First Bite: How We Learn To Eat, Bee Wilson, a British food journalist, reports on several ways to do this.\n\nWilson reports on a particularly remarkable experiment that introduced new foods to a toddler and a 5-year-old through a method developed and tested by Keith Williams, a psychologist and professor of pediatrics who is now the director of the Feeding Program at the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Appetite in 2007, Williams worked with two children, a boy aged aged 3, and a girl of 5. Both children had autism and the extremely selective eating habits that often accompany it. The boy would only eat toasted cheese sandwiches and hotdogs, and was often disruptive and aggressive during family meals. At one time, the girl had been open to five foods: bacon, chocolate, eggs, hot dogs, and toast. However, she had not allowed any foods past her lips for six months when she arrived at Williams’ clinic, and was reliant on a gastronomy tube.\n\nThe psychologist designed a repeated exposure protocol, a modified version of the Tiny Tastes idea, to introduce the children to unfamiliar foods in manageable rations during short “taste sessions.”\n\nHere’s the key: these tastes could be as small as a grain of rice, or a pea, to make the sampling as easy as possible for the children. They would be allowed to leave the room to play only after they tasted the new food.\n\nThis treatment also involved “probe meals” in which a child was presented with tablespoons of three or four different foods, not all of them new. In the “meals,” the children were instructed to take a bite of something, but were allowed to leave the room after 10 minutes, whether they had eaten or not. Crying and tantrums were ignored, but any time a child took a bite of food, they were praised and rewarded with positive attention.\n\nThe children’s parents selected which foods were to be introduced to their child’s repertoire, and the micro-entrees were prepared the way the family would normally prepare them at home. (The doctors didn’t use any special cooking techniques, or butter or sugar, to enhance the food’s flavor.)\n\nWhenever a child began eating one of the novel items without any resistance or crying in a taste session, the bites of that food would become larger at subsequent presentations. Next, extra bites were added. Those foods ignored during probe meals would be introduced in taste sessions. In scientific parlance, this gradual change in the environment is called “fading”: the experiment’s rigid structure faded as eating became more natural, which required more effort from the subject over time.\n\nAfter two weeks of such intense therapy, the little boy was eating 65 different foods, and the girl, 49. Checking in on the families three months later, Williams found that both children had continued to eat most of the previously untried foods. Working with colleagues and students, he has since replicated the study twice, training parents in the approach both times, and both studies were just as successful.\n\nExtreme selective eating disorders are more common in children with special needs like autism, but intense, defiant pickiness can be an issue for any toddler and can live on well past childhood. Williams notes that most parents experiment only with “hunger induction”: they simply wait out a child’s refusal to eat what everyone else is having. If that worked, he tells Quartz, he wouldn’t be seeing hundreds of kids every year.“What happens is, the parent gets punished,” he says. “The child may yell, they may cry. Can a parent put up with that until the kid will try a new food?”\n\nWhat scientists know is that a person, young or old, must be exposed to an unfamiliar food many times before they will learn to like it, Williams emphasizes. The protocol is not about nutrition; it’s about debunking beliefs that apples, for instance, taste terrible, or that the only good foods are white ones.\n\nThe amount of food that’s eaten is irrelevant, says Williams, but “what we do know is ingestion counts. Sniffing the food, playing with the food, rubbing the food in your hair —none of that seems to matter.”\n\nWhat’s more, kids who only lick unfamiliar foods, which some methods of dealing with picky children suggest, typically don’t move on to eating them. Worse, they may pick up the habit of licking what’s put before them, not eating it. “We don’t think it helps,” Williams says, “but there’s not a lot of good research on licking.”\n\nIf a child believes that they will gag if they consume a pea-sized piece of asparagus or half a blueberry, he instructs them to start chewing as soon as the tiny amount of food is in their mouth, because chewing and gagging are incompatible human responses. The child should also be allowed to choose the perceived lesser evil among new flavors, and the options should include starches, meats, fruits and vegetables. If the beef doesn’t look appealing, maybe the peach will.\n\nThis recipe for repeated exposure is not going suit every child, and may be too intense for some. It’s also not the only evidence-backed method for broadening a child’s repertoire of foods. Williams co-authored Broccoli Boot Camp, published in 2016, to outline several others.\n\nIn an email to Quartz, Wilson called Williams one of her “greatest heroes.” She found his work “extremely moving,” she said, because “he was so clearly trying to alleviate the huge suffering that goes along with extreme picky eating, for both children and parents.”\n\nThat might sound hyperbolic, but for a working parent who’s exhausted even before a dinner battle begins, it’s easy to feel fatalistic about the way a child responds to food. Williams has shown that there’s no need to be.\n",

          "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk today shared the first video of what he calls a “release candidate” version of Tesla’s upcoming Model 3 electric car. We’ve seen Model 3 prototypes before, and this five-second clip doesn’t really show us anything new — but Musk enjoys feeding the hype train.\n\nHe also noted that calling the new car the “Model 3” was sowing confusion among customers about whether it was the “next version” of Tesla’s car, like Apple going from the iPhone 2 to iPhone 3 — “not true,” Musk said.\n\nHe called himself “a dumb idiot” for naming it Model 3, saying he “didn’t realize at the time that it would cause confusion.” Instead, he says customers should think of the Model 3 as similar to the BMW 3 Series or Audi A4, while the Model S is like a BMW 5 or 6 Series — different cars but sold side by side. Musk noted that he will keep driving the Model S even after the Model 3 arrives.\n\nIn an anecdote we’ve known for a while, Musk reminded followers that the Model 3 was originally going to be named the Model E (“for obvious dumb humor reasons” — meaning the cars would be Models S, E, and X), but a Ford trademark lawsuit prevented that from happening. Next up, naturally, is Model Y. S3XY.\n\nFirst drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 http://pic.twitter.com/zcs6j1YRa4\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\n\nAs part of his tweetstorm this morning — which occurred during a flight to Cape Canaveral for a SpaceX rocket launch — Musk replied to a number of current and potential Tesla customers about what’s coming from the company in the coming months. Among other things, he said:\n\nThe first Model 3 cars will all be rear-wheel drive, much like the Model S was, to make production a bit simpler. All-wheel drive / dual-motor versions will come six to nine months after launch.\n\nPerformance versions of the Model 3 will come “probably a year from now,” though the Model S will remain faster because it has room for a larger battery.\n\n“More cowbell” will be coming in the Tesla 8.1 software update, which is expected next week. It’s a reference to a Will Farrell Saturday Night Live skit of which Musk is a fan. Previous versions of Tesla’s vehicle operating system have included Easter eggs referencing cowbell.\n\nThe Model 3 will have a single screen combining instrument cluster and infotainment information in one place. Hinting at possible increased autonomy, Musk asked how often riders look at the instrument panel in a taxi.\n\n@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\n\nThe Model S will remain the fastest Tesla until the next-generation Roadster is released — though that car is “a few years away.”\n\nA Tesla semi-truck will beat sports cars from zero to 60 mph.\n\nTesla and SolarCity will begin taking orders for its “solar roof” product next month.\n",
