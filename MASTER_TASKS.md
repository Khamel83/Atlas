# Atlas Master Tasks - Unified Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-05  
**Strategy**: Integration-First Development  
**Primary Focus**: Atlas-Podemos Integration → Production-Ready System

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Foundation work completed, moving to Integration-First strategy  
**Next Priority**: Atlas-Podemos integration to avoid rework in production system  
**Total Remaining**: ~300 tasks across multiple workstreams  

## Strategic Approach: Integration-First

**Rationale**: The Atlas-Podemos integration represents a significant architectural enhancement that should inform all subsequent development. Completing integration first avoids massive rework later.

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1A**: Atlas-Podemos Foundation Integration (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Phase 1B**: Complete Production-Ready Phase 1 with integrated architecture (Week 4)  
3. **Phase 2**: Unified system Core Features & Pipeline Integration (Weeks 5-8)
4. **Phase 3+**: Continue production-ready development on integrated platform (Weeks 9+)
