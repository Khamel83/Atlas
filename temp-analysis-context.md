# Atlas Analysis Context - Temporary Storage

## Product Vision (User Input)
- **Problem**: Dissatisfaction with Instapaper limitations, subscription costs, wanting self-ownership of data
- **Goal**: Collect ALL personal world data for future modeling/intelligence work
- **Challenge**: Data acquisition in usable format has been the hardest part
- **Use Case**: Personal only, never commercial - "just a nerd who loves info and reads and thinks a lot"
- **Value**: Could help dramatically once data + intelligence are combined

## Current State Assessment
- **Status**: User abandoned project at some point, unsure how far development progressed
- **Request**: Programmatic and systematic review of current status
- **Documentation**: Exists but potentially outdated, most recent by timestamp should be most accurate

## Technical Preferences
- **Philosophy**: Open source, self-hosted
- **LLM Access**: OpenRouter API
- **Deployment Target**: Raspberry Pi (preferred)
- **Fallback**: Mac Mini M4 with 16GB RAM + Thunderbolt storage for intensive tasks (transcription, etc.)
- **Storage**: Tons of spinning disks available for significant data
- **Scope**: Personal reading/content only - "not draining the ocean"

## Licensing & Usage
- **License**: MIT
- **Intent**: Personal use or single-person use only
- **Commercial**: No commercial intent expected/allowed (but MIT allows legal use)

## Agent OS Integration
- **Standards**: Will be documented in /.agent-os/standards/
- **Instructions**: Will be documented in /.agent-os/instructions/

## Codebase Analysis Summary
- **Project Type**: Python-based cognitive amplification platform
- **Architecture**: Sophisticated modular design with 6-layer content fallback system
- **Status**: Feature-rich but needs infrastructure work (testing, config, deployment)
- **Unique Value**: Advanced cognitive amplification beyond simple content aggregation
- **Technical Debt**: 2-3 weeks of infrastructure work needed before feature development

## Next Steps
1. Push current state to GitHub
2. Create Agent OS documentation structure
3. Install Agent OS with analyzed context
4. Prioritize infrastructure completion
