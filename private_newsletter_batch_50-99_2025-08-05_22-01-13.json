Weinberg continued: </p><pre><code><code>“[L]ast year, we had a very strong year in restructuring. I think it was our second best year ever, and we continue to see activity level in that space to be very strong. And frankly, the business has changed a little bit and that it's not really just bankruptcies and restructuring companies. There is a lot of liability management that plays into it.

It's a bit stubborn. On the long end, it doesn't appear as if the Fed is likely to be more connotated in the short-term.

What that nets for actual numbers depends on an awful lot of factors that are kind of beyond our ability to completely predict.”\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n</code><span>“If you look at where interest rates are, the number of sick balance sheets out there as a result of rapidly increasing interest rates for a higher period of time than perhaps people would have anticipated or some would have hoped for is really contributing to just more of those sick balance sheets needing to be taken care of. And that manifests itself in various different ways. And as we look at it and we just look at the level of inquiry that we have, we continue to feel confident that we'll be higher for longer.”</span></code></pre><p>CFO, Lindsey Alley added: </p><pre><code>“So long as the M&amp;A markets are robust, it's just hard to grow the restructuring business unless you start to see pressure on interest rates in sort of higher versus pressure lower. I think we feel comfortable saying higher for longer. I don't think we're comfortable saying that potentially in this market could be incremental growth.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNow, if the market changes, obviously, then you'll start to see pressure on M&amp;A and you'll see some upward pressure on Financial Restructuring. But in this current market condition, assuming that it continues to get better, we love the fact that we're not seeing restructuring revenue decline. We love the fact that they're holding where they are. And we think it's a kind of a heroic effort from the team to keep us flat in an increasing M&amp;A environment.”</code></pre><p>In other words, Houlihan eked out some better YOY performance but not by much.

I - look - we did have a very good year. The economy feels strong enough that, as of now, I don't see an event that would cause a major disruption. Of course, I have to also say that things are pretty volatile in and around the things like the government and things like that. So anything could happen. I would expect 2025 to be a year that looked a lot like 2024 as of now, and that's without any external events in the restructuring world.”</code></code></pre><p>And here’s a little tidbit from Mr. Moelis on if the depressed sponsor led M&amp;A environment is elevating restructuring:</p><pre><code><code>“On the creditor side, it's interesting, probably our biggest opening is a lot of our restructurings were company side or debtor side. It's where we do a lot. I mean, it's probably 70:30. And we're we are being much more active now on the private credit side and trying to get in on that side of the restructurings. Is your point like these companies couldn't sell so they're getting into trouble? I don't think that's the answer, because it's hard to sell a company that can't cover its debt. So I don't think M&amp;A truly covers restructuring. I think restructuring might be driven more by interest rates would just make the onerous debt obligations kind of come in quicker than they would have three or four years ago.

As an illustration, there's over $3 trillion of unrealized value across 28,000 unsold companies in global buyout portfolios, and more than 40% of these investments are four years or older.

Well, the acquisition and integration of car washs requires some greenback and, well, this sucker accumulated a good chunk of debt.***** Like $653.9mm worth. Of course, this hefty load of funded debt is all of the term loan variety which means there’s as much variability in the interest rate as there is wash quality.****** Oops, missed a spot! And by spot we mean a 12/31/24 maturity that the company, thanks in part to federal interest rate hikes, didn’t have the money to service (there’ve been forbearances — 24 of them).******* Toss in some unprofitable and off-market leases, labor shortages, increased wages (and hurricanes) and suddenly these things aren’t throwing off as much cash anymore. With softer discretionary spending, you can bet that the recurring revenue from car washs ain’t so recurring anymore. Combined, these factors “</span><em>…led to an industry-wide decline in retail traffic and increased UWC membership ‘churn.’</em><span>” You mean a car wash subscription isn’t sticky??

Hmmm, food for the kids or UWC?</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>What’s hilarious about this is that all of the PE bros rushed into this scam at once. As everyone rolled up mom and pop car washes across the nation, competition got worse and worse. “</span><em>Over the past five years, upwards of 900 new car wash sites have opened annually across the United States.</em><span>” The lack of originality amongst the PE bros is next level. </span></p><p><span>You have to hand it to the bros, though: confronted with all of these issues they’ve been looking to better the business. Per the first day declaration of Chief Transformation Officer </span><strong>Kevin Nystrom</strong><span> of </span><strong>AlixPartners LLP</strong><span> (“AlixPartners”):</span></p><pre><code><code>“Recognizing these headwinds, Zips has diligently pursued a wide range of measures over the past two years to proactively address and mitigate the impact of these challenges. The Company successfully negotiated savings with its vendor partners and optimized on-site labor and consumable spend. Through implementation of the “ZipsMe 2.0” program in 2023, the Company enhanced and standardized the quality of car washes and service across all sites — establishing a national pricing model, investing in service location aesthetics, and leveraging improved and consistent cleaning chemicals. In 2024, Zips introduced (a) Project Refresh, an initiative focused on refurbishing certain existing sites to drive higher customer traffic, and (b) the Zips App, a mobile app designed to drive customer engagement and e-commerce capabilities and develop actionable insights into customer behavior. Targeted initiatives helped to reduce costs, improve customer retention, and drive increased conversion of Retail Wash customers to the UWC membership.”</code></code></pre><p>Who knew car washes could be so tech forward? </p><p>Of course, these initiatives didn’t do enough to bolster liquidity, address maturities or, more holistically, firm up the balance sheet. </p><p><span>But, to their credit (or discredit, depending upon your point of view), Atlantic Street Capital stepped up to the plate. Unfamiliar with the otherwise well known phrase “</span><em>good money after bad,</em><span>” it teed up $68mm of fresh equity from July ‘23 through March ‘24; it also issued a $30mm sponsor guaranty. The guaranty and $30mm of the equity were issued </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7be51179-a100-40a1-9ee0-885591b467d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">in connection with a maturity extension</a><span> through December 31, 2024, the former of which could be triggered by a failure to adhere to certain refinancing milestones. Clearly these guys LOVVVE their car washes. </span></p><p><span>With those milestones in sight by end of summer ‘24 and no hope for a refinancing to follow, Zips hired a full slate of RX pros, including </span><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</strong><span>, </span><strong>Evercore Group LLC ($EVR)</strong><span>(the RX group, the private capital solutions group had attempted the refi), and AlixPartners. The board of managers of Zips also appointed two independent/disinterested managers and formed a special committee. Shortly thereafter Zips added </span><strong>Hilco Real Estate LLC</strong><span> to the mix to deal with the lease footprint. With its lineup in place, Zips engaged in the “unorthodox” eve-of-bankruptcy divestment of its operations in Orlando, Florida on February 4, 2024 (at 10x EBITDA to another PE sponsor, lol) and lined-up a sale of its St. Louis, Missouri operations (at 15x EBITDA, to be consummated while in BK). </span></p><p><span>Of course, there are lenders on the other side of the aforementioned debt and there’s an ad hoc group in these cases (made up of </span><strong>HPS Investment Partners</strong><span>, </span><strong>Brightwood Capital Advisors</strong><span>, </span><strong>PennantPark Investment Corp.</strong><span>) represented by </span><strong>Paul Hastings LLP</strong><span>. And, congrats to all involved because in the absence of an out-of-court solution, the debtors have obtained the support of 100% of the term lenders and their major preferred shareholders******** around a deleveraging transaction that will (a) shed $279mm of debt (by equitizing the term loans) + millions in lease obligations and bring in a much-needed influx of new capital in the form of take-back paper (including a $150mm holdco facility and a $225mm opco term loan facility) and a new $15mm RCF to fund go-forward operations. “</span><em><span>An expedited and orderly process—</span><strong>with the support and buy-in from the Company’s landlord constituency</strong><span>—will allow Zips to continue as a healthy going-concern and preserve nearly 1,800 jobs,</span></em><span>” Nystrom said (somewhat ominously — emphasis his, not ours).********* Notably, general unsecured claims and preferred equity holders are slated to get bupkis in these cases — a proposed disclosure statement and plan of reorganization are already on file. </span></p><p><span>To power these cases — and because the debtors only had $1mm of cash as of the petition date despite $303mm of TTM revenue — the debtors lined up an $82.5mm SOFR+7.25% PIK DIP from their existing secured lenders, $30mm of which is new money (agented by </span><strong>Brightwood Loan Services LLC</strong><span>)($20mm interim). It’s only a 1.75x roll-up and there are no other fees on the DIP. </span></p><p>The debtors hope to go effective no later than 70 days after the petition date. That’s what one might call the “zip in, zip out, and zip on” bankruptcy experience.**********</p><p><span>The debtors are represented by Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP (Joshua Sussberg,*********** Ross Fiedler, Lindsey Blumenthal, Kent Hayden, Richard Howell, Seth Sanders, Tiffani Chanroo) and Gray Reed (Jason Brookner) as legal counsel, AlixPartners LLP (Kevin Nystrom) as financial advisor and CTO, Evercore Group LLC (Daniel Aronson) as investment banker. An ad hoc group of term lenders is represented by </span><strong>Paul Hastings LLP</strong><span> (Justin Rawlins, Charles Persons, Robert Nussbaum, Matthew Friedrick) as legal counsel and </span><strong>Berkeley Research Group</strong><span> as financial advisor. </span></p><h5>*Looking at you, Big Lots Inc. and JOANN Inc. Even getting to a plan of liquidation has been uber dicey in a lot of recent cases. </h5><h5>**Mr. Califano, a Partner at Sidley &amp; Austin LLP (“Sidley”), is not, as far as we can tell, involved in these cases (though his firm is as counsel to the prefs); he is, however, a big fan of the Northern District of Texas, where a lot of his company-side representations just happen to file for bankruptcy. Sidley, much like Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, spent some time early last year in the District of New Jersey in the aftermath of the Judge Jones fiasco in the Southern District of Texas. It appears the dalliance with New Jersey was short-lived. Here we are nearly six weeks deep into ‘24 and we can count on zero hands how many notable cases have filed in New Jersey. </h5><h5>***And people say there’s such a thing as subscription fatigue. </h5><h5>****You’re low key welcome for the Valentine’s Day suggestion folks. Anyway, these guys actually developed their own Insta show called #carwashconvos featuring interviews with college football and basketball players. G-d bless “name, image and likeness” benefits for college athletes. We’re in the golden age of content, y’all. </h5><h5>*****These guys went on a spending spree, going from 185 locations in early ‘20 to 260 locations by the end of ‘22 — powered not just by PE dollars but by four different senior preferred equity raises. One cannot help but to think that this business was 100% a ZIRP creation with all kinds of money just searching under rocks for return. As of the petition date, the debtors have $299.8mm of total preferred equity outstanding between a senior first priority slug ($229mm) and a junior second priority slug ($70.8mm). </h5><h5>******The interest rate on the term loan hit 12% and in ‘23 the company had $87mm in interest expense. </h5><h5><span>*******Choice quote from the first day hearing out of counsel, Mr. Sussberg: “</span><em>I remember when we were engaged and the management team and the sponsor sent us over the documentation, and we saw 24 amendments to the credit agreement. I haven't been doing this that long. It's been 22, 23 years. I've never seen 24 amendments to the credit agreement. My first comment in this day and age with LME, liability management transactions, being all the vogue, I said, I don't think I need to look at your credit agreement. I am pretty sure that there is going to be zero flexibility after 24 amendments.</em><span>”</span></h5><h5>********As Mr. Sussberg made clear in his “very entertaining” presentation — Judge Larson’s words, not ours — the fulcrum security in these cases is undeniably the term loans. Recognizing that and unwilling to pony up some more cash, the prefs consented to these chapter 11 cases and their 🍩 treatment. They got some expenses paid for their trouble. </h5><h5><span>*********Man, Kirkland loves messing with landlords. Basically what Nystrom is saying here is that landlords ought to get bent and provide some concessions or else there’ll just have lease rejection claims entitled to zilch under the plan. Notably, there are two independent/disinterested managers here who are conducting an investigation of pre-petition conduct, particularly that of the debtors’ sponsor. We’re sure an official committee of unsecured creditors will have some things to say about that in an effort to find </span><em>some</em><span> source of recovery in these cases. </span></h5><h5>**********We pulled this language from a presentation Mr. Sussberg played in court. </h5><h5>***********Sadly there are no Zips locations in NY. Otherwise we would have heard all about Mr. Sussberg’s five-minute-or-less car wash experience. Spared. For once. He did, however, manage to drop a #humblebrag about his soon-to-be-collegiate-athlete son for, like … reasons. Can’t fault a proud dad though. </h5><h3>💩Correction💩</h3><p>In Sunday’s otherwise a$$-kicking paying-subscribers’-only briefing … </p><div><div><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/91abfca5-1663-4883-87df-e669171627d2?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><picture><source><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c6d985c-0a5c-4352-be75-ac03ec2d3eca_1024x683.jpeg\"></source></picture></a></div><h4><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/91abfca5-1663-4883-87df-e669171627d2?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">💥What's the Deal(EO)?💥</a></h4><div>Feb 9</div><span>Read full story</span></div><p>… we wrote the following in the EW Scripps section: </p><blockquote><p><em><span>“SSP acquired </span><strong>ION Media Networks, Inc.</strong><span> in FY’21 from </span><strong>Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

question that has been floating around AI circles for a while, and it's a hard one to answer for two reasons. First, what is AGI, and second, \"feel\" is a bit like obscenity: as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/184/\">Jacobellis v. Ohio</a>, \"I know it when I see it.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave my definition of AGI in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.HgyHGAdKOCcTCoHq6V332JyTGM_hTEptFaDr_CJ7F0Xv27pudbRRr3_2pLoTvbPMbPUbAYRjEX4UJgFD27vYQj8XhVac57tJkp--GNCD8iJj47fdGaEZEJUEVErQeJ0vKJQd6cTcClrfMW0pO_pPtrc-aYvdvwEtbm2Op2g7y7bJuu9ojbFHJqPVUFALyUdVMYbOSM8omMBtfkHRoYSguHPmLXQGIyb94J5SNjXp-uqwVP4JS3ucBwGETbRQZz6UYtDaGeV1lVzVeSOw1JUSwMWhbYJiAj7wwDIWsP_CEWTAmsZhuEqOfQzPmJmMHQgg6bpeNud9McZI1mf5eCzu_g\">AI's Uneven Arrival</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>What <span>o3</span> and inference-time scaling point to is something different: AI’s that can actually be given tasks and trusted to complete them. This, by extension, looks a lot more like an independent worker than an assistant — ammunition, rather than a rifle sight. That may seem an odd analogy, but it comes from <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs\">a talk Keith Rabois gave at Stanford</a></strong>…My definition of AGI is that it can be ammunition, i.e. it can be given a task and trusted to complete it at a good-enough rate (my definition of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is the ability to come up with the tasks in the first place).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The \"feel\" part of that question is a more recent discovery: DeepResearch from OpenAI <em>feels</em> like AGI; I just got a new employee for the shockingly low price of $200/month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deep Research Bullets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI announced Deep Research in a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\">February 2 blog post</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Today we’re launching deep research in ChatGPT, a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep research is OpenAI's next agent that can do work for you independently — you give it a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Powered by a version of the upcoming OpenAI o3 model that’s optimized for web browsing and data analysis, it leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to synthesize knowledge is a prerequisite for creating new knowledge. For this reason, deep research marks a significant step toward our broader goal of developing AGI, which we have long envisioned as capable of producing novel scientific research.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's honestly hard to keep track of OpenAI's AGI definitions these days — CEO Sam Altman, <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations\">just yesterday</a>, defined it as \"a system that can tackle increasingly complex problems, at human level, in many fields\" — but in my rather more modest definition Deep Research sits right in the middle of that excerpt: it synthesizes research in an economically valuable way, but doesn't create new knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already published two examples of Deep Research in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-earnings-openai-deep-research-the-unbundling-of-substantiation/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.B6SNCi6anqF3HngxsXKho2jyaEFJqGD4e2aQZz037VnqQ_6w8xJPsZuzhA3h5O5WqqNSxwEuJbEMI_VUMM-twmg0wcnDK634D6k4_fq1LcqC6gMhMaVUBDqSrRrI_A9leRGqjNbQ4nBRfdPIVTN6KmDb2DwDc2sPONNgNZZUgb_sJ5akxJmBqwZfKPYOOTGVYxNgNZtmiPre771Ez5yPlitGnghpKCZF1Gqcxp0MfHIB3TwMpK2cE1IBv_IKUlcJeZZi4Byj1zT8s82pHqewYC8wA8NEI5hw_ArX_pAvg_Tx4h86dTHybly0ceovGzIutBubhtDf-RwR6wOY4BcxSQ\">last Tuesday's Stratechery Update</a>.

This is important information because I want you to understand my previous analysis of Apple, and the voice in which I write on Stratechery. I want a research report about Apple's latest earnings for fiscal year 2025 q1 (calendar year 2024 q4). There are a couple of angles I am particularly interested in:</code></p>\n<p><code>- First, there is the overall trend of services revenue carrying the companies earnings. How has that trend continued, what does it mean for margins, etc.</code></p>\n<p><code>- Second, I am interested in the China angle. My theory is that Apple's recent decline in China is not new, but is actually part of a longer trend going back nearly a decade. I believe that trend was arrested by the chip ban on Huawei, but that that was only a temporary bump in terms of a long-term decline. In addition, I would like to marry this to deeper analysis of the Chinese phone market, the distinction between first tier cities and the rest of China, and what that says about Apple's prospects in the country.</code></p>\n<p><code>- Third, what takeaways are there about Apple's AI prospects? The company claims that Apple Intelligence is helping sales in markets where it has launched, but isn't this a function of not being available in China?</code></p>\n<p><code>Please deliver this report in a format and style that is suitable for Stratechery.</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-earnings-openai-deep-research-the-unbundling-of-substantiation/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.B6SNCi6anqF3HngxsXKho2jyaEFJqGD4e2aQZz037VnqQ_6w8xJPsZuzhA3h5O5WqqNSxwEuJbEMI_VUMM-twmg0wcnDK634D6k4_fq1LcqC6gMhMaVUBDqSrRrI_A9leRGqjNbQ4nBRfdPIVTN6KmDb2DwDc2sPONNgNZZUgb_sJ5akxJmBqwZfKPYOOTGVYxNgNZtmiPre771Ez5yPlitGnghpKCZF1Gqcxp0MfHIB3TwMpK2cE1IBv_IKUlcJeZZi4Byj1zT8s82pHqewYC8wA8NEI5hw_ArX_pAvg_Tx4h86dTHybly0ceovGzIutBubhtDf-RwR6wOY4BcxSQ\">read the Update for the output</a>, but this was my evaluation:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first answer was decent given the paucity of instruction; it’s really more of a summary than anything, but there are a few insightful points. The second answer was considerably more impressive. This question relied much more heavily on my previous posts, and weaved points I’ve made in the past into the answer. I don’t, to be honest, think I learned anything new, but I think that anyone encountering this topic for the first time would have. Or, to put it another way, were I looking for a research assistant, I would consider hiring whoever wrote the second answer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, Deep Research isn't a rifle barrel, but for this question at least, it was a pretty decent piece of ammunition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeepResearch Examples</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, that ammunition wasn't that valuable to me; I read <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/this-is-tim-and-kevan-apples-q1-results-call-transcribed/\">the transcript of Apple's earnings call</a> before my 8am <a href=\"https://dithering.passport.online/member/episode/apple-earnings?guid=https%3A%2F%2Fdithering.passport.online%2Fmember%2Fepisode%2Fapple-earnings\">Dithering recording</a> and came up with my three points immediately; that's the luxury of having thought about and covered Apple for going on twelve years. And, as I noted above, the entire reason that the second Deep Research report was interesting was because I came up with the ideas and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7ImFydGljbGUiOiJDTDVYUDR4Q0Y4cVRLdXlLWTR3aTEiLCJhdWQiOlsiSmVyU2RTQWlCeUZoMWVrWVBNRTluViIsIkFzNjdQcmREalRFNG1mc1FZQzdEckUiLCJQMU5UQzF4dHNRbjFBbWVSV3lXclVrIiwiUWJhaDNvYmNxaXQ4dDdGVU1lNVNtdiIsIlNBZW1aNnlzRjZVY2p6Z0VFaWNVZE0iLCJZRlBndDduYmVBTnJpUzhTdXRCcGVjIl0sImRpc3RybyI6IkNMNWM3dDNtblJnV1E0VmI4c2pnMSIsInVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyL3RoZS1haS11bmJ1bmRsaW5nLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzQxNzk0NDM0LCJpYXQiOjE3MzkyMDI0MzQsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.fgHSNP5xBocMP8UqexV3clNK9VH3LWTIsb3fIAv89KyKwFlzK-w3Wb8MnsnrZSEQTJpKvlaRm69_hDUrSZtRsN9q3gSi2r79ez1vWeNB_b0AJEQ8RfxRuUNpdTNk2IAGneZRvt-hC2dkN-LbbsK-iKs4y4YtbaP6BEhdbpJqzPFw6nFGEhW9N0qEH8AdedK3HFZ75PdqqQXljLuFNnZ2fFg8RHUbxTUdw4VzkjF_zSwT5sCtTAmx-bQkppM_-U7i23fBL7A-ZEyjtvuwGdK7u-w97WpDs7qT-nqsgPp3DQg2l8IMhw3AnIiBVB3F4M9bMb8I4SlKTLy2ckgVwzYGpA\">Deep Research substantiated them</a>; the substantiation, however, wasn't nearly to the standard (in my very biased subjective opinion!) of a Stratechery Update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found a much more beneficial use case the next day. Before I conduct a Stratechery Interview I do several hours of research on the person I am interviewing, their professional background, the company they work for, etc.; in this case I was talking to Bill McDermott, the Chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, a company I am somewhat familiar with but not intimately so. So, I asked Deep Research for help:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>I am going to conduct an interview with Bill McDermott, the CEO of ServiceNow, and I need to do research about both McDermott and ServiceNow to prepare my questions.</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>First, I want to know more about McDermott and his background. Ideally there are some good profiles of him I can read. I know he used to work at SAP and I would like to know what is relevant about his experience there. Also, how and why did he take the ServiceNow job?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>Then, what is the background of ServiceNow? How did it get started? What was its initial product-market fit, and how has it expanded over time? What kind of companies use ServiceNow?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>What is the ServiceNow business model? What is its go-to-market strategy?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>McDermott wants to talk about ServiceNow's opportunities in AI. What are those opportunities, and how are they meaningfully unique, or different from simple automation?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>What do users think of ServiceNow? Is it very ugly and hard to use? Why is it very sticky? What attracts companies to it?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>What competitors does ServiceNow have? Can it be a platform for other companies? Or is there an opportunity to disrupt ServiceNow?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>What other questions do you have that would be useful for me to ask?</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>You can use previous Stratechery Interviews as a resource to understand the kinds of questions I typically ask.</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67a231d2-49c4-8011-a18f-751e435a9820\">the results</a> eminently useful, although the questions were pretty mid; I did spend some time doing some additional reading of things like earnings reports before <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-servicenow-ceo-bill-mcdermott-about-enterprise-ai-agents/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.c1Emdawj9tRvtirDOcK50kEGz0hwPr_TycsDOKgKiULBlnKx340ZA72ZNposr-0BOjg7tI1CygxWL_5771_y4JzuLMoE3TYSsKGNYwLeU_RMF14fkN0_qhWOVIcR_0Jk1d_GdBj-wCOnGPMczVO1G9VQxThfOomA--mEKlWnDjrQwmbrgM6OohGIj40jeMHWelyg-3M92iMZbS9OzmX3lVlG5-Nh9AU7npU1rsq_5SoOLsrQOr4i7LIor3D2Z7pmNuZGAi1bvoTgv9y3QW3EvMoQfae47rJSEINPvEuoJpAjAuaXntoybiWoyjDsxAhm5ePwaKlo-umiZQkKS13y5Q\">conducting the Interview</a> with my own questions. In short, it saved me a fair bit of time and gave me a place to start from, and that alone more than paid for my monthly subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another compelling example came in researching a friend's complicated medical issue; I'm not going to share my prompt and results for obvious reasons. What I will note is that this friend has been struggling with this issue for over a year, and has seen multiple doctors and tried several different remedies. Deep Research identified a possible issue in ten minutes that my friend has only just learned about from a specialist last week; while it is still to be determined if this is the answer he is looking for, it is notable that Deep Research may have accomplished in ten minutes what has taken my friend many hours over many months with many medical professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the final example, however, that is the most interesting, precisely because it is the question on which Deep Research most egregiously failed. I generated a report about another friend's industry, asking for the major players, supply chain analysis, customer segments, etc. It was by far my most comprehensive and detailed prompt. And, sure enough, Deep Research came back with a fully fleshed out report answering all of my questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also completely wrong, but in a really surprising way. The best way to characterize the issue is to go back to that famous Donald Rumsfeld quote:</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div> <a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/R4jHSz3N?cover=1&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;loop=0&amp;muted=0&amp;persistVolume=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=0\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-R4jHSz3N.png\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<p>There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with the report I generated — and once again, I'm not going to share the results, but this time for reasons that are non-obvious — is that it completely missed a major entity in the industry in question. This particular entity is not a well-known brand, but is a major player in the supply chain. It is a significant enough entity that any report about the industry that did not include them is, if you want to be generous, incomplete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, in fact, the fourth categorization that Rumsfeld didn't mention: \"the unknown known.\" Anyone who read the report that Deep Research generated would be given the illusion of knowledge, but would not know what they think they know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knowledge Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most painful lessons of the Internet was the realization by publishers that news was worthless.

Thus, when Chavern complains that “today’s internet distribution systems distort the flow of economic value derived from good reporting”, he is in fact conflating societal value with economic value; the latter does not exist and has never existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This failure to understand the past leads to a misdiagnosis of the present: Google and Facebook are not profitable because they took newspapers’ <em>reporting</em>, they are profitable because they took their <em>advertising</em>.

It may have technically been the case that those of us old enough to remember newsstands bought the morning paper because a local light manufacturing company owned printing presses, delivery trucks, and an advertising sales team, but we too believed we simply wanted to know what was happening. Now we get that need fulfilled for free, and probably by social media (for better or worse); <a href=\"https://x.com/schopenhauernow/status/1887189824185958603?s=46\">I sometimes wish I knew less</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, what Deep Research reveals is how much more could be known. I read a <em>lot</em> of things on the Internet, but it's not as if I will ever come close to reading everything. Moreover, as the amount of slop increases — whether human or AI generated — the difficulty in finding the right stuff to read is only increasing. This is also one problem with Deep Research that is worth pointing out: the worst results are often, paradoxically, for the most popular topics, precisely because those are the topics that are the most likely to be contaminated by slop. The more precise and obscure the topic, the more likely it is that Deep Research will have to find papers and articles that actually cover the topic well:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deep-research-4.png\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This graph, however, is only half complete, as the example of my friend's industry shows:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deep-research-3.png\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a good chance that Deep Research, particularly as it evolves, will become the most effective search engine there has ever been; it will find whatever information there is to find about a particular topic and present it in a relevant way. It is the death, in other words, of security through obscurity. Previously we shifted from a world where you had to pay for the news to the news being fed to you; now we will shift from a world where you had to spend hours researching a topic to having a topic reported to you on command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless, of course, the information that matters is not on the Internet. This is why I am not sharing the Deep Research report that provoked this insight: I happen to know some things about the industry in question — which is not related to tech, to be clear — because I have a friend who works in it, and it is suddenly clear to me how much future economic value is wrapped up in information not being public. In this case the entity in question is privately held, so there aren't stock market filings, public reports, barely even a webpage! And so AI is blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another example, this time in tech, of just how valuable secrecy can be.

What wasn't clear was to what extent AWS was transforming Amazon; the company slowly transitioned Amazon.com to AWS, and that was reason enough to list AWS's financials under Amazon.com until 2012, and then under \"Other\" — along with things like credit card and (then small amounts of) advertising revenue — after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grand revelation would come in 2015, when Amazon announced in January that it would break AWS out into a separate division for reporting purposes. From a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/aws-move-disclosure-suggest-amazon-yielding-more-to-wall-street-idUSKBN0L305S/\">Reuters report at the time</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>After years of giving investors the cold shoulder, Amazon.com Inc is starting to warm up to Wall Street. The No. 1 U.S. online retailer was unusually forthcoming during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, saying it will break out results this year, for the first time, for its fast-growing cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The additional information shared during Amazon's fourth-quarter results as well as its emphasis on becoming more efficient signaled a new willingness by Amazon executives to listen to investors as well. \"This quarter, Amazon flexed its muscles and said this is what we can do when we focus on profits,\" said Rob Plaza, senior equity analyst for Key Private Bank. \"If they could deliver that upper teens, low 20s revenue growth and be able to deliver profits on top of that, the stock is going to respond.\" The change is unlikely to be dramatic. When asked whether this quarter marked a permanent shift in Amazon’s relationship with Wall Street, Plaza laughed: \"I wouldn't be chasing the stock here based on that.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the shift is a good sign for investors, who have been clamoring for Amazon to disclose more about its fastest-growing and likely most profitable division that some analysts say accounts for 4 percent of total sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, AWS accounted for nearly 7 percent of total sales, and it was dramatically more profitable than anyone expected.

That’s more than Google, which IPO’d at a valuation of $24.6 billion, and certainly a lot more than Amazon, which finished its first day on the public markets with a valuation of $438 million. Don’t feel too bad for the latter, though: the “IPO” I’m talking about was Amazon Web Services, and it just so happens to still be owned by the same e-commerce company that went public nearly 20 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m obviously being facetious; there was no actual IPO for AWS, just an additional line item on Amazon’s financial reports finally breaking out the cloud computing service Amazon pioneered nine years ago. That line item, though, was almost certainly the primary factor in driving an overnight increase in Amazon’s market capitalization from $182 billion on April 23 to $207 billion on April 24. It’s not only that AWS is a strong offering in a growing market with impressive economics, it also may, in the end, be the key to realizing the potential of Amazon.com itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>That $25.6 billion increase in market cap, however, came with its own costs: both Microsoft and Google doubled down on their own cloud businesses in response, and while AWS is still the market leader, it faces stiff competition. That's a win for consumers and customers, but also a reminder that known unknowns have a value all their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Surfacing Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that Amazon was wrong to disclose AWS's financials. In fact, SEC rules would have required as much once AWS revenue became 10% of the company's overall business (today it is 15%, which might seem low until you remember that Amazon's top-line revenue includes first-party e-commerce sales). Moreover, releasing AWS's financials gave investors renewed confidence in the company, giving management freedom to continue investing heavily in capital expenditures for both AWS and the e-commerce business, fueling <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.qmrOjbCL2Cm6eXRSTlRHcsjXwAKsY28J0Rur4pVXl0LOHMCwSblKhUp0o_fsZBMJWySZLAqn2BmALLYHdRSwx3FjAia8LyOAfQA_5yoenxgBUx9e-m4GibJOBZu4-FzXMuGn6Nib5URcpQUBLzq8qwsmgBEqNdcQ25pIONDEWeOCY14TW0pu1h2zcs85j_GUC51HzZ68z46sEkF_X2hLlBgxegVscxHmQobcdlX-fM7ej6c3P8G0aPCJ0fDbyJiJVyhOfqVU0WgivWw9JAXtgiDlE0Yr5ysYt22oa_ASFHYLBWKUmyqBhcbUDE52KInZY8e2kwfYwhIKPA3Cnovzeg\">Amazon's transformation into a logistics company</a>. The point, rather, is to note that secrets are valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is intersting to consider is what this means for AI tools like Deep Research. Hedge funds have long known the value of proprietary data, paying for everything from satellite images to traffic observers and everything in between in order to get a market edge. My suspicion is that work like this is going to become even more valuable as security by obscurity disappears; it's going to be more difficult to harvest alpha from reading endless financial filings when an AI can do that research in a fraction of the time. ((I don't think Deep Research is good at something like this, at least not yet. For example, I generated a report about what happened in 2015 surrounding Amazon's disclosure, and the results were pretty poor; this is, however, the worst the tool will ever be.))</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with those hedge fund reports, however, is that they themselves are proprietary; however, they are not a complete secret. After all, the way to monetize that research is through making trades on the open market, which is to say those reports have an impact on prices. Prices are a signal that is available to everyone, and it's going to become an increasingly important one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, by extension, is why AI's like Deep Research are one of the most powerful arguments yet for prediction markets. Prediction markets had their moment in the sun last fall during the U.S. presidential election, when <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-the-trump-whale-and-prediction-markets-beat-the-pollsters-in-2024-dd11ec4e\">they were far more optimistic about a Trump victory than polls</a>. However, the potential — in fact, the necessity — of prediction markets is only going to increase with AI. AI's capability of knowing everything that is public is going to increase the incentive to keep things secret; prediction markets in everything will provide a profit incentive for knowledge to be disseminated, by price if nothing else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also interesting that prediction markets have become associated with crypto, another technology that is poised to come into its own in an AI-dominated world; infinite content generation increases the value of digital scarcity and verification, just as infinite transparency increases the value of secrecy. AI is likely to be the key to tying all of this together: a combination of verifiable information and understandable price movements may the only way to derive any meaning from the slop that is slowly drowning the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the other reality of AI, and why it is inescapable. Just as the Internet's transparency and freedom to publish has devolved into torrents of information of questionable veracity, requiring ever more heroic efforts to parse, and undeniable opportunities to thrive by building independent brands — like this site — AI will both be the cause of further pollution of the information ecosystem and, simultaneously, the only way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deep Research Impacts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of this is in the (not-so-distant) future; for now Deep Research is one of the best bargains in technology. Yes, $200/month is a lot, and yes, Deep Research is limited by the quality of information on the Internet and is highly dependent on the quality of the prompt. I can't say that I've encountered any particular sparks of creativity, at least in arenas that I know well, but at the same time, there is a lot of work that isn't creative in nature, but necessary all the same. I personally feel much more productive, and, truth be told, I was never going to hire a researcher anyways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, though, speaks to the peril in two distinct ways. First, one reason I've never hired a researcher is that I see tremendous value in the search for and sifting of information. There is so much you learn on the way to a destination, and I value that learning; will serendipity be an unwelcome casualty to reports on demand? Moreover, what of those who haven't — to take the above example — been reading Apple earnings reports for 12 years, or thinking and reading about technology for three decades? What will be lost for the next generation of analysts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, there is the job question: lots of other entities employ researchers, in all sorts of fields, and those salaries are going to be increasingly hard to justify. I've known intellectually that AI would replace wide swathes of knowledge work; it is another thing to feel it viscerally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, that is why the value of secrecy is worth calling out. Secrecy is its own form of friction, the purposeful imposition of scarcity on valuable knowledge. It speaks to what will be valuable in an AI-denominated future: yes, the real world and human-denominated industries will rise in economic value, but so will the tools and infrastructure that both drive original research and discoveries, and the mechanisms to price it. The power of AI, at least on our current trajectory, comes from knowing everything; the (perhaps doomed) response of many will be to build walls, toll gates, and marketplaces to protect and harvest the fruits of their human expeditions.</p>\n\n                                                                            \n                                                                        \n

We may have discovered how to stop childhood tumors before they even begin to form.</p><p>Researchers found that the protein Olig2 is a key driver of medulloblastoma (a deadly pediatric brain cancer) growth by activating dormant cancer stem cells and turning them into rapidly dividing tumor cells. Blocking Olig2 with the drug CT-179 keeps these stem cells in a dormant state, preventing both initial tumor formation and relapse after treatment. In short, CT-179 might be able prevent pediatric brain tumors and also prevent them from coming back after treatment. </p><p><span>This approach is different from current therapies that target fast-growing tumor cells but fail to stop the cancer from returning. By focusing on the root of the disease—the stem cells that fuel tumor regrowth—this strategy could lead to more effective, long-lasting treatments for medulloblastoma.

But if you’re anything like me, you likely copy + pasted the highly technical research into ChatGPT and prompted the model to give you a relatively short summary intended for an intelligent, but not expert audience. ChatGPT has been good at this type of summary work for a while. Now, it’s starting to get better at multi-step, complex research. Not just summarizing but, discovering, synthesizing, and reasoning about the content, and then it adapts its plan as it discovers more and more information. It can take over 5 minutes for deep research to return its answer as it works through the information and develops a thoughtful response. The response, then, is a fully cited research paper at the level of an expert researcher.</span></p><p>The use cases for deep research are plentiful — imagine an expert-level report on any topic generated in about 5 minutes. Not AI slop or excerpt from Wikipedia, but an in-depth, highly technical (if necessary), and thoughtfully reasoned research report. That’s useful in scientific research, advanced data analysis, investing, law, national security…or really any type of knowledge work that requires complex thinking. Ultimately, the goal for a tool like deep research is that it would be producing novel concepts and contributing to the research itself, but we’re not there yet. The current iteration is about discovering, synthesizing, and reasoning through existing information and presenting it in a way that can be understood.</p><p><em>Rauch et al</em></p><blockquote><p><em>The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b3c1a954-b5c5-4026-b2bf-adcbbd38137e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06bd8977-1024-4fde-8b21-daa72c721329_1200x821.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>What is this, CRISPR for ants?!</p><p>NanoCas is a newly designed tiny CRISPR system, about one-third the size of standard CRISPR (Cas9), making it small enough to fit into a single AAV delivery vector. An AAV delivery vector is a harmless virus used to deliver genetic material into cells for gene therapy. The big breakthrough with NanoCas is that its ability to fit into a single AAV is that it allows gene editing to reach muscle and heart tissues, not just the liver.</p><p><span>In monkeys, NanoCas successfully edited 30% of muscle cells, the first time a single-AAV CRISPR system has done this. It also fixed genes linked to cholesterol and muscular dystrophy in mice and monkeys, showing promise for treating muscle diseases.

If you’re not technical but have tried to code before, you’re likely familiar with the challenges of setting up first setting up the coding environment and actually deploying the code into production.

I am surprised I was able to get any work done this week, frankly. I love football, I love the Eagles, and I love the city of Philadelphia. So this is a big week!</p><p>In a world that’s constantly changing, it’s rare to have a true interest that’s lasted now for over 20 years. It’s comforting and makes you feel grounded. That’s how many people feel about football, regardless of where you’re from. But there’s something about Philly and the Eagles that’s a bit different, at least in my very biased opinion.</p><p>Perhaps it’s due to the city itself: Philly is often overlooked and wedged between New York and DC. It’s one of the few big cities in our country where the people that live here are from here. It’s filled with history dating back to our country’s founding and prides itself on its blue collar work ethic. It’s racially and economically diverse, but on Sundays we all bleed green. Perhaps it’s the franchise: so close for so many years, but never quite able to push it over the goal line. It has ownership that embraces the city and invests in the team as if it were the city’s most valuable asset. It attracts talented players that know, going in, they’re playing for more than a paycheck. Perhaps it’s the players: this century, we’ve been blessed by big personalities like Donovan McNabb, Terrell Owens, and DeSean Jackson. Certified Football Guys like Jason Kelce, Chris Long, and Brandon Graham. And truly elite talents like Fletcher Cox, Lane Johnson, and Saquon Barkley.</p><p>I am lucky to be an Eagles fan.

So </span><em>really</em><span>, it’s ~$115mm of “new” new money and otherwise a roll-up by any other name. In addition to that refinancing, the DIP also includes a straightforward, cashless roll-up of $442mm-$497mm of other non-first out 1L debt. So calling a spade a spade, it’s a 6.7 to 7.2x roll-up all-in, all subject to the final DIP order.</span></p><p>Typically, we’d expect the recently-empowered Office of the US Trustee (the “UST”) or, once appointed, an official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”) to take issue with that: higher ratios being objectionable and all for “reasons.” In this case, the UST was either asleep at the wheel or didn’t care,* and there’s no UCC in these cases, though that isn’t for lack of trying. The UST just couldn’t garner enough interest and threw in the towel on January 16, 2025. But perhaps that was to be expected because, after all, the debtors’ restructuring support agreement (the “RSA”), which has the support of 88% of the debtors’ prepetition funded debt, intends to ride general unsecured creditors (“GUCs”) through the bankruptcy unimpaired.</p><p><span>Well, </span><strong>Inmarsat Global Limited</strong><span> (“Inmarsat”),** an alleged unsecured creditor and unquestionable defendant of a debtor-filed adversary complaint,*** couldn’t stand for that and took it upon itself to “</span><em>fill the roll [sic] of estate watchdog and ensure some adversarial process is effectuated to ensure that any DIP Financing is in the estate’s best interest</em><span>.” On January 29, 2025, it filed a DIP objection, which, in addition to hating on the roll-up, picks fights about the DIP’s ~$100mm in fees, 17.5% interest rate, 120-day maturity (subject to five additional 120-day, lender-approved extensions), “other” overreaching terms (spoiler alert: it was the typical waivers), and, of course, the Delaware-standard 75-day lien challenge period. Such a fiduciary. Truly a shame (for Inmarsat) that its fees aren’t being paid by the estates, but, lol, it tries to fix that too by tossing in a token, unsupported, and throwaway request that Inmarsat’s “</span><em>work should be given superpriority status under Bankruptcy Code section 503(b)(9) as a ‘substantial contribution’ in these cases</em><span>.” Superpriority status? On what basis? Only Inmarsat could tell you.</span></p><p><span>To be blunt, aside from </span><em>maybe</em><span> the roll-up argument, the objection sucks, and even we — as card-carrying supporters of pushback on debtor bullsh*t — are puzzled by why Inmarsat chose to pursue it. The roll-up itself, including the refinancing, isn’t even the highest ratio we’ve seen approved, and more to the point, no one other than the DIP lenders, including Inmarsat, offered up financing, despite the debtors having had, as their counsel </span><strong>Milbank LLP</strong><span> (“Milbank”)(Dennis Dunne, Matthew Brod, Lauren Doyle, Andrew Leblanc) put it, “</span><em>the help of some of the most highly qualified restructuring advisors in the world</em><span>.” That’s right, the WORLD. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c99427b1-88a9-4553-83c7-636807ed6088?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_455,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2537e652-498f-46c3-9f59-5b608e9c79fb_455x200.gif\"></a><figcaption><span>Source: Tenor.

All of this was in documents filed right there on the publicly-available (and free!) court docket, well ahead of the objection.</span></p><p><span>You can see where this is going, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that each of the debtors, the ad hoc 1L group,***** and the ad hoc cross-holder group****** sh*t on the objection. In addition to thinking it’s meritless, they all believe Inmarsat is trying to blow up the deal because of its “</span><em>clear ulterior motive of obtaining the Debtors’ valuable spectrum rights, [which] clearly illustrates that Inmarsat is not looking out for the best interest of the Debtors’ estates.</em><span>” The cross-holder group goes on to point out “</span><em>Inmarsat’s best prospect for a full recovery [as a GUC] is the restructuring transaction already on the table</em><span>” because it’s </span><em>already</em><span> sitting behind a f*ckton of debt …</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8fc15da1-2885-411b-8eb3-9b9c1c11847a?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefbcdd5f-7944-4c29-a528-d852313a7f1d_632x397.png\"></a><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e1f6e853-c58f-49be-9603-04984b472263?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Dkt. 2</a><span>.

Money talks.</span></p><p><span>On the other issues, the debtors </span><em>et al.</em><span> made the arguments we identified☝️ and, on maturity, took the easy road out by drawing everyone’s attention to the fact that the DIP lenders have been funding the business since October ‘20 — that’s … </span><em>counting fingers</em><span> … 4.5 years — without receiving “</span><em>a single cash interest payment</em><span>” and “</span><em>there is no reason to believe that the DIP Lenders … will suddenly pull the rug out from under them.</em><span>” So even with the DIP’s initial four-month maturity date, the debtors are expecting the lenders to keep on extending and then work something out at the two-year mark so long as the cases haven’t gone off the rails. We buy that, and again, Inmarsat ain’t offering anything better (or at all).</span></p><p>The hearing on the DIP and objection is scheduled for later today at 1pm ET, where we expect the court to have little or no problem overruling any part of Inmarsat’s objection not withdrawn or resolved ahead of then.</p><h5>* We tried pulling the first day hearing audio to figure out what happened there, but the court, lol, forgot to attach it to the filing.

The XB-1, piloted by Chief Test Pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg (great name), reached an altitude of 35,290 feet and accelerated to Mach 1.122 (750 mph), marking the first time a privately developed civil supersonic jet has achieved supersonic speeds.</p><p>Boom’s XB-1 demonstrator aircraft and its demonstration of going supersonic, is a major milestone for the company’s ultimate mission of making commercial aircraft travel supersonic. The company’s planned Overture airliner aims to have capacity for 60-80 passengers and travel at speeds of Mach 1.7, or 1,300 mph. Overture should be able to travel twice as fast overwater and 20% as fast overland as traditional commercial airliners. That would cut down the time it takes to fly from New York to London from about seven hours to approximately three and a half hours. The company has already secured 130 pre-orders for its supersonic airliners from the likes of American Airlines, United, and Japan Airlines.</p><p>Boom. </p><p><em>From DeepSeek</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.

DeepSeek is marketing that it spent $5.5M to train R1, but that is likely an underestimation of the true costs, let alone the cost is was able to forgo by building on (and training on) the models that came before it. Whatever the true cost, it was surprisingly cheap and that’s going to drive costs down in the rest of the industry.</p></li><li><p>Open sourcing leads to commodization and, likely, a faster pace of innovation. Going forward, there will still be frontier breakthroughs, but those breakthroughs will likely be quickly copied and open sourced. That’ll drive down the prices to use AI models and that will mean we can use AI to do more things that otherwise wouldn’t be economically logical.</p></li><li><p>We’ll likely see Jevons Paradox play out at massive scale. Jevons Paradox is the idea that increasing efficiency in resource use often leads to higher overall consumption of that resource, rather than a reduction. Everyone is freaking out about how DeepSeek impacts future Nvidia demand, but Jevons would lead you to believe that training AI models get more cost efficient, the demand for chips will actually increase. This is especially true for Nvidia, which now does a much higher percentage of its revenue from inference: as models get cheaper and AI usage increases, inference needs will increase ~linearly. The training business may be in some trouble, but that trouble may be offset from a massive wave of demand for inference.</p></li><li><p>Sam Altman is now basically running a DTC brand at OpenAI. In DTC, it’s hard to differentiate on product and channels for acquiring new customers are becoming saturated and less efficient. On the product side, once there are signs of traction, your product gets copy catted out of the wazoo — both from legitimate competitors and Chinese dupers. On the acquisition front, overtime the value accrues to who is able to generate attention and demand. In traditional DTC, that’s Meta, Google, and Amazon. It’s not yet quite exactly clear where value will accrue in user acquisition in AI. Ultimately, the only way to differentiate or win long-term is to build a brand that people trust or feel compelled to talk about. Sam if you need some advise on running a DTC brand, feel free to shoot me a text.</p></li></ol><p><em>Ashlee Vance for Core Memory</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Near the end of last year, Science revealed</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/be14f571-97a9-4eb6-981d-33d655f28ae7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"> its work</a><span> on technology that makes it possible to fuse large quantities of lab-grown neurons with an animal’s brain.

One macro stat.</p><p>Personal: When I was two years old, I had open heart surgery to repair an atrial septal defect.

I’ve been scared of and interested in heart stuff ever since.</p><p><span>Macro: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., killing one person every </span><strong>33 seconds</strong><span>—more than all forms of cancer combined. Turns out the heart is a very, very important organ. So advancements in cardiovascular research can have a massive impact.

In initial trials on monkeys, these grafts integrated well, improved heart function, and showed no major side effects.

I’ve been wanting to share today’s Deep Dive with you for a long time.  </p><p>Normally, when people ask me “What are you writing about?” and I say the name of the company, at least half the people say something like, “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of them, they’re the ones who…” or “That’s so and so’s company, right?”</p><p>When I’ve mentioned Meter, nine times out of ten, I’ve been met with: “Huh? Who’s that?” These are people in tech, other investors, people whose job it is to know today about the companies that will be worth the most money tomorrow. Blank stares.</p><p>That is what I live for. Meter has the widest gap between promise and awareness of any company I’ve covered, and I’m pumped to be the one to get to tell you about them.</p><p><span>Because the one out of ten who does know about Meter </span><em>knows</em><span>. The Meter Fan Club, small but ravenous, has been a secret society. Today, it’s no longer secret.</span></p><p><strong><span>Note: the essay is too long to fit in an email; </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/16f9d120-87a6-458d-9e18-39645b7d1c55?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">click to read the whole thing online</a></strong><span>. </span></p><p>Then print it out.

Assuming suitability, electrical engineers would design custom electrical plans for each building, which included the placement of wiring, fixtures, switches, and other electrical components. Then they would install wiring and appliances, like light bulbs and chandeliers. Once the building was wired, engineers would run wires from the nearest utility pole to the building, hence the blocked city sky.</p><p><span>Then, the electric company would install a </span><strong>meter</strong><span> to measure electricity consumption for billing purposes, and send representatives to train tenants on the safe operation of electrical systems.</span></p><p>The utilities you don’t think about at all today, like water and power, did not always have the relatively seamless interface that we’re all familiar with: pay bill, access the fruits of an incredibly complex network at the turn of the faucet or the flip of a switch. Nothing ever starts out that way.</p><p>When J.P. Morgan asked Thomas Edison to make his Italiante New York City mansion the first private residence in the city to be illuminated solely by electricity, Edison’s crew of workers:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>Clopped up in a horse-drawn wagon to Morgan’s nearly renovated mansion at 219 Madison on the northeast corner of 36th Street. They laboriously excavated a large earthen cellar beneath the wooden stable, their shovels rhythmically slinging dirt and rocks into a growing pile. Within the musty space of the dirt cellar, they installed a squat steam engine and boiler to power two electric generators, all of which displaced Morgan’s carriage horses to a nearby stable. The men also dug a ditch connecting the new cellar to the house, lined it with bricks, laid in the electrical wires, and bricked it over. Inside the mansion, decorator Christian Herter supervised the snaking of insulated electrical wires up through the elaborately wood-paneled and plastered walls where ordinarily the gas lines would have gone. These wires were then threaded through every space in the mansion, and new electrical fixtures were installed. In some rooms, electrical wires hung straight down every few feet from small holes in the tall ceilings, sprouting at their tips several small lightbulbs.</span><span>¹</span></em></p></blockquote><p>After all of that, the generators made so much noise as to disturb the neighborhood peace, and the steam engine spit out fumes and smoke that tarnished neighbors’ silverware. Then, a broken spud set fire to the Morgans’ library.</p><p><span>That was 1882. Two decades later, in 1901, the dream of omnipresent, effortless electricity was still that, as captured by Emile Zola in </span><em>Travail</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The day must come when electricity will be for everyone, as the waters of the rivers and the wind of heaven. It should not merely be supplied, but lavished, that men may use it at their will, as the air they breathe.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The buildout of the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9cb32b79-6b8b-464e-92b8-ad727da45b0e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">electric grid</a><span> that we know today was a multi-billion, multi-decade process that Brian Potter needed four parts of a series on The Grid (</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9cb32b79-6b8b-464e-92b8-ad727da45b0e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">I</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c31c0256-3315-453f-b8e8-99d2d54db644?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">II</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/58092b73-c5c8-4e51-8da0-26d199a443f3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">III</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/374766f7-c4b5-48d0-8f00-8a7ae9fbd74b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">IV</a><span>) to cover. In addition to the grid itself, each individual home, factory, and office had to be wired to receive and utilize the electrons that the grid delivers. That takes investment, buy-in, and time. Lots of time.</span></p><p>The project continues, and will continue. Infrastructure projects are endlessly expansive.</p><p>But the current state of things is that when you move into a building – a home, an office, a warehouse, a store, any building really – it’s already wired up for electricity. The electricity comes with the building. You just move in, sign up, and turn on.</p><p><strong>That is not how the internet works for companies, yet.</strong></p><p><span>While each building has internet from one or more ISPs running into it, a working </span><em>network</em><span> doesn’t just come with the building.</span></p><p>The network is customized from scratch each time: new ISP contract, new network design, new hardware, new security, new software. IT teams work with a fragmented set of vendors. One company provides the internet (the ISP), another designs the network, another sells the hardware (either directly or as a value-added reseller), another installs, and yet another provides the software to monitor, manage, and configure the network as a company’s needs inevitably change (managed service provider, or MSP).</p><p>And the system works well enough! You’re probably reading this from office WiFi that’s working just fine.</p><p>There is some really good networking hardware out there. Cisco’s Meraki is the leader in the space. Meraki generates somewhere between $5-10 billion, and is growing fast. Ruckus makes great access points. Palo Alto Networks makes great security hardware and software; it’s worth $125 billion. Arista makes great switches; it’s worth $136 billion.</p><p><span>That hardware can be CapEx intensive, sure, but as an IT leader at Dollar General told a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/048f380c-eca1-49c5-a46d-a50c8a639037?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Tegus interviewer</a><span>, retailers often prefer CapEx over OpEx because they can amortize the costs over time.</span></p><p><span>Managed Service Providers do a robust book of business, too. The global MSP market for networking alone is something like </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/205c252a-60c7-4e98-85d0-c9fd99feaa47?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">$70-80 billion</a><span> and expected to grow at an 8% CAGR, much faster than the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/792eefc8-e9ec-412b-97ca-718c171efc8c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">3% growth CIOs expect</a><span> for internal IT teams. It’s more fragmented, but huge.</span></p><p>Certainly, setting up and managing a network can still be a pain for IT teams. It’s more expensive than it probably should be. A MSP can’t build the kind of software to manage networks that a company could if the company also built the hardware.</p><p>All of which is to say, the internet is not yet a utility, but it does work.</p><p>But the internet can and should work much better. It must, as the internet inevitably grows and more and more of what we do gets done in packets.</p><p><span>That is the bet that </span><strong>Sunil and Anil Varanasi</strong><span> made a decade ago, continue to execute against today, and plan to execute against for a very long time.</span></p><p><span>For the better part of the last decade, they’ve been building </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/31b7be24-2da2-428b-a94a-9725818b58d3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Meter</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Meter builds </span><strong>internet infrastructure</strong><span>.

I said of course.</p><p>It had gotten more confident, he observed, but had lost its vitality and freshness. More recently, after we’d gotten to know each other, he recalled the spirit of his message: “The first thing I said was, ‘Yo, what happened to you?’”</p><p>Somehow, the feedback came off as true and refreshing, because I’d been feeling it myself without putting it into words.

In the process, better, faster networking has gone from a “nice-to-have” to strategically critical. Everyone understands the need for power, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2a967f9d-1a79-4e30-9b93-b73e016cb732?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">few understand the need for networking</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Second, my appreciation and understanding of </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1144d69b-eabf-479e-9f3b-5ea007e80d30?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vertical Integrators</a></strong><span> has grown, too. Certainly thanks in part to spending so much time learning from Sunil and Anil, my entire investment thesis is that startups have the opportunity to overtake sclerotic incumbents with vertically integrated offerings that are better, cheaper, faster and higher-margin. </span><strong>Meter is a living masterclass in vertical integration.</strong></p><p><span>Third, I have a working thesis that </span><strong>AI supports winner-take-most vertical integrators in previously fragmented hardware markets</strong><span>. Meter is as good of a supporting example as I’ve found.</span></p><p><span>And finally, </span><strong>Meter’s master plan is entering its endgame, even if it has decades left to go</strong><span>. Specifically, by vertically integrating hardware, software, data pipelines, APIs, operations, and applications, Meter has what it needs to do two things:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Enter the </span><strong>Data Center market, </strong><span>which it plans to do this year using the same architecture it uses for local networks to reap the benefits of scale and compounding.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Develop autonomous networks by building a foundation model for networking</strong><span>. No other company has all of the ingredients and talent needed to do this. Meter does.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The nature of vertical integration, done right, is that it takes longer to get going, and then it zips. Done </span><em>really</em><span> right, by the time the incumbents know you’re coming, you have them in </span><strong>checkmate</strong><span>. To the extent that data is more valuable today, this is more true today than ever.</span></p><p>We will talk about all of this. This is the kind of stuff that I could, and will, nerd out on for thousands of words.</p><p>Foundational to all of that, though, or as a necessary precondition to it, is the je ne sais quoi that’s made me want to spend over a year writing this one piece.</p><p><strong>The “Oh, I just used Zoom” of Meter is Sunil and Anil.</strong></p><h3><strong>The Brothers Varanasi</strong></h3><p><span>When I wrote in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5d8228e9-c619-4f73-92b1-ef1ab8d2f0f1?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vertical Integrators: Part IV</a></em><span> that the hard-to-define characteristic of truly exceptional founders is that “</span><strong>they make world-class people want to do their best work for them,”</strong><span> I had Anil, and that conversation, in mind.

There’s a sense you get from the Varanasis that whatever they chose to do, they’d be able to pull it off. Chips, cancer cures, fusion, whatever.</p><p>But given how I’ve described them so far – high-performance, reliable, operating quietly in the background, getting the best out of anyone connected to them – maybe what they decided to do was inevitable.

As you sit there, bored or self-conscious, your camera captures light through its lens and focuses it on a sensor, which converts the light into electrical signals, which are processed by an image signal processor that corrects color, reduces noise, and encodes signals into a format like YUV or RGB. This happens up to 30 times per second.</p><p>When you speak up – “Sorry.. yes … can you .. ok, good well I was just going to say…” – the sound waves you emit cause your microphone’s diaphragm to vibrate. These vibrations, too, are converted into electrical signals, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) samples these signals, typically at 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz for high-quality audio. The samples are ever-so-briefly stored in a buffer.</p><p>Zoom’s software takes this raw video and audio data and compresses it – using a codec like H.264 or VP9 for video, or like Opus or AAC for audio – to reduce the size of the data while maintaining quality. This compressed data is split into smaller chunks, each of which is wrapped in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) headers that include sequence numbers and timestamps so that all of the chunks can be properly reassembled on the other end.</p><p>At this point, somewhere between 6 and 26 milliseconds into the process, the data first becomes a packet, of sorts: an “RTP packet.” These packets are encapsulated in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams, which add another layer of information about where the data is heading and who can access it.</p><p>Our new packet is one of many, over at least 100 created every second on your Zoom call, separated at birth to find their own way across the world only to be reunited on the other end. For this architecture, we have the Soviets to thank, at least in part.</p><p>Communications networks used to be “circuit switched”: a connection was established between two points, and data flowed continuously from one to the other. For a while there, when you wanted to call someone, a switchboard operator would manually connect your line to the recipient’s line to create a dedicated circuit for the call.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4067da30-3529-4e95-b5bd-27c0d798e63b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77b499d9-6fed-4731-abd1-36b2b5a5dff6_908x665.png\"></a></figure></div><p>This was inefficient for obvious reasons, but a bigger concern was that it was vulnerable.

With mainframes, there was no need for local area networking; people brought their tasks to the machine. Some had dumb terminals attached to them – kind of like computer screens and keyboards with no processing power of their own – but all of the terminals in one location simply interacted with the central machine.</p><p>That changed in the early 1970s with the minicomputer. Instead of mainframes that cost millions of dollars, out of reach of most small organizations and departments within larger ones, minicomputers cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000. All of a sudden, one company, even one office building or floor in an office building, could have multiple computers, and peripherals, like printers, that worked with them.

He had graduated from Harvard and MIT—bitching every step of the way, to hear him tell it—with degrees in electrical engineering, business, and applied mathematics,” wrote Michael Hiltzik in </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d4b07804-9fc1-4761-9411-0f8940ba663b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Dealers of Lightning</a></em><span> – with problems to solve.</span></p><p>In 1973, at Xerox PARC, Metcalfe invented Ethernet, not to change the world, but simply to get PARC’s Alto computers to connect with each other. The network had to be cheap – “less than 5% of the cost of the computers it was connecting,” simple, reliable, expandable, and fast. Nothing Metcalfe came up with met all of those requirements, until he remembered a paper he’d read months earlier by a professor at the University of Hawaii on a radio network called ALOHAnet, which was designed to let computers talk to each other across the Hawaiian archipelago, but which, Metcalfe realized after correcting some of the professor’s mistaken assumptions and calculations, and replacing radio transmission with inert physical lines, a passive medium, like the “‘luminiferous aether’” once thought to pervade the universe as the medium for the propagation of light,” would also work for letting computers speak to each other within the same office.</p><p>And Bob said, let there be Ethernet.</p><p><span>With Ethernet, computers could share the same coaxial cable to communicate. Instead of serial connections and point-to-point links, </span><strong>CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)</strong><span> meant that devices could \"listen\" to the wire before sending data to avoid collisions and retransmit if a collision was detected. Metcalfe’s first version could carry 2.94 Mbps, which seems hair-pullingly slow today but was groundbreaking at the time.</span></p><p><span>Like many technologies invented at Xerox PARC, Ethernet was commercialized somewhere else. Metcalfe left to start 3COM – </span><strong>Com</strong><span>puter, </span><strong>Com</strong><span>munication, </span><strong>Com</strong><span>patibility – in 1979, where he brought on </span><strong>Bob Krause</strong><span> as President in 1981 and elevated him to CEO in 1982.</span></p><p><span>Krause gave an incredible interview on the company’s history on the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/0fcd42dd-eb8b-4597-9914-8ad8db2b7875?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Seeking Truth in Networking podcast</a><span>. He said that in the beginning, the cost of Ethernet – the digital card (NIC), transceiver, and cable – was $3,500. He knew the company needed to get the cost down to $1,000, then to $100. They drew an exponential declining curve from $3,500 to $100 over 7 years, and realized that they’d just need to follow Moore’s Law’s 50% cost declines per year.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/34fce53b-4360-4326-bda4-b3dfe5735890?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a76c622-b08c-4e0c-b5aa-5e6b0dfebece_908x527.png\"></a></figure></div><p>To do that meant putting Ethernet on a chip – a VLSI, or Very Large Scale Integration – with the NIC and the transceiver on a single card, which they did. Originally, computers with Ethernet Chips were daisy-chained together with a single coaxial cable used as a backbone and each computer connected to the backbone through T-connectors with BNC connections.</p><p>That might be the way we did things today if it weren’t for another famous borrower of Xerox PARC technology.</p><p><span>See, Apple was 3COM’s second or third customer. When Krause and the team showed </span><strong>Steve Jobs</strong><span> the daisy-chained setup, he… didn’t love it.</span></p><p>“Who’s the braindead idiot asshole who came up with this?” he asked. “This is shit.

Steve Jobs is one, partially responsible for the path it travels on its local network, not along a daisy-chained path from computer to computer, but over twisted pair cabling that plugs into a switch as easily as a telephone jack into the wall.</p><p><span>So our packet, just a few milliseconds old, begins its journey across the network. The NIC transmits its signals as radio waves to the </span><strong>access point</strong><span> – here, we first encounter Meter’s hardware.</span></p><p><span>The access point performs a crucial transformation: it receives these wireless radio signals, converts them back into digital data, and then sends that data to the </span><strong>switch</strong><span> – also provided by Meter – via Ethernet cable (with Power Over Ethernet, PoE, which powers and connects in the same cable).</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9d5238d4-8d6d-4c4f-a6a9-e772cef1cc59?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2148,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2e8ec5d-8b5c-443c-96be-601ca481b4c0_1074x543.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Not to Scale, Very Bad Representation, You Get the Point</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The switch reads the MAC Address within the ethernet frame to figure out where to send the packet next, whether to another device on the network or to a gateway router that will send it out into the </span><strong>internet</strong><span>. The switch forwards the packet only to the specific port needed to reach its destination, avoiding congestion and increasing efficiency in the network.</span></p><p><span>Let’s assume that our packet is ready, that it’s time to venture out to the internet, the network of networks. Typically, the switch sends the packet to the </span><strong>router,</strong><span> which, as its name suggests, </span><em>routes</em><span> the packet to the destination it reads from its IP header.</span></p><p><span>In Meter’s case, the </span><strong>security appliance</strong><span>, which is a firewall and router in a single device, serves as the physical router. Its routing stack is a combination of its software-defined router and hardware, which work together to manage traffic, handle IP addresses, and determine the best path by which to send our packet across the internet.</span></p><p>From the security appliance, the packet leaves the Local Area Network (LAN) out into the Wide Area Network (WAN). From the device on the network, it travels through a series of point-to-point links, like fiber-optic cables that use light pulses to transmit data at near light-speeds, to your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) backbone.</p><p><span>At this point, our packet’s journey looks almost like the journey of an electron from generation facility to service panel. In this analogy, the backbone is like the transmission line – it’s the big bundles of fiber-optic cables, buried </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7f0ce799-67dd-444e-b6bb-49d0a9365c7e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">underground or under the sea</a><span>, over which data travels very long distances.

The border router uses BGP to determine the packet’s next hop, typically along one of the high-speed fiber-optic transmission lines that interconnect data centers and ISPs across the country or across continents.</span></p><p>Here, our packet, still barely even a twinkle in its parents’ eyes on human timescale but nearly halfway through its packet-scale life, comes to its first fork in the road.</p><ul><li><p>If it’s traveling to a destination in its own geographic region or on the same ISP (or an ISP with a peering agreement with its own), it might take a direct route, hopping from the ISP’s network to an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), a physical location where networks connect and packets switch lanes.</p></li><li><p><span>If it’s traveling to another country or on another network, it’s likely that it will have to pass through at least one </span><strong>data center</strong><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>Ours is traveling across the globe, say to India, the reverse of the journey that the Varanasis made as pre-teens.

It’s almost home. It makes the final sprint over Jio fiber to the local network of the person on the other end of the Zoom.</p><p>At last, after a journey of about 200 milliseconds (an eternity in packet time, but less than the blink of a human eye), our packet arrives at its destination and makes the original local network journey in reverse: switch to access point to radio signal then over WiFi to the computer.</p><p>Today, in India, our packet likely travels across Cisco hardware.

In less time than it took you to read \"Sorry.. yes …\", it traveled halfway around the world, bringing a tiny piece of your presence along with it.

We’re happy to have Andrew here because he’s been a key player in some of the big name bankruptcies of the last several years. Let’s dive in.</span></p><p><strong>PETITION: Let’s start with a big one — an oldie but goodie. You really caught a lot of people’s attention in the Hertz Global Holdings Inc. chapter 11 bankruptcy case when you pushed for a more robust sale process and your clients — along with Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management LLC — ended up with the winning bid. The bid got shareholders a pretty remarkable recovery. Give us your version of events — the “untold story,” if you will. We’re nerds so we really like the nitty gritty details that may not have been covered before!</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>It was a whirlwind. We started with a small group that had strong conviction that Hertz was undervalued based on the Debtors’ own projections in their disclosure statement, and that we should wage a valuation fight in court. The more we dug in, the more upside we saw. It was just a matter of getting the word out because this opportunity was overlooked in the market.</em></p><p><em><span>The key moment in the case – one part of the “untold story”– was when we got </span><strong>Steve Tesoriere</strong><span>, </span><strong>Sherman Lau</strong><span> and </span><strong>Andrew West</strong><span> at </span><strong>Oaktree</strong><span> involved. Once word got out that Oaktree had conviction and was ready to put significant money to work, our investment group expanded, and the case morphed into assembling a competing deal. Our ad hoc equity committee raised $1 billion in a matter of a few weeks (my friend </span><strong>Rebwar Berzinji </strong><span>of </span><strong>Seaport Global</strong><span> gets much of the credit for that). Everyone on the Debtors’ side has declared this case a magnificent success, but what they don’t say now is that they tried to block our deal at every opportunity, and that the lenders may have taken this upside away from us as a result. They blocked us from submitting a better deal that would have precluded the Debtors from giving our competitors a break-up fee and they blocked us from trying to get financing from parties that the Debtors had exclusivity. We had to fight them in court to get an auction, and they nearly prevailed.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Then the auction unfolded. We were locked in conference rooms for 40 hours straight during COVID. There was nearly a fistfight (I won’t say who was involved but it wasn’t me!), and many other antics that I will remember forever. The lion’s share of the credit should go to </span><strong>Tom Wagner</strong><span> of </span><strong>Knighthead Capital</strong><span> and his team for the winning bid. He had 50 financing parties, and he had to develop a bidding strategy that did not require approval for every bidding move he made. He had wiggle room to propose warrants (rather than straight equity or additional cash), and he proposed warrants of such a long tenor that they were very close to being equity. He put those on the table in the final hour when the Debtors called for last and best bids, and we prevailed.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I’m so proud of the outcome, and I think it’s a testament that Chapter 11 can maximize value when the process allows it. The outcome was far from certain, but these are the fights I relish. I have to credit </span><strong>Sina Toussi </strong><span>of </span><strong>Two Seas</strong><span>, </span><strong>Jeremy Carton</strong><span> of </span><strong>Alta Fundamental</strong><span> and </span><strong>Larry Robbins</strong><span> and </span><strong>Jon Ansel</strong><span> of </span><strong>Glenview</strong><span> for being the first-movers that got our group off the ground.</span></em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Any thoughts on the Third Circuit decision revolving around the Hertz makewhole drama? Care to explain what happened for our audience? </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>Everything changes in a solvent case where shareholders get a premium recovery. The question that arose is how to treat unsecured noteholders’ makewhole claim, which many courts have held constitutes “unmatured interest” that is normally disallowed under the Bankruptcy Code. The Third Circuit held that while the makewhole claim is indeed unmatured interest, the “solvent-debtor” applies and in order for the noteholders to be deemed “unimpaired,” the company must pay them their makewhole premiums. This decision was not surprising as the Third Circuit followed a number of other circuits that have reached the same conclusion.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Let’s move to another big one. You had a role in the Purdue Pharma matter, having filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court on behalf of bankruptcy law professors Ralph Brubaker, Bruce A. Markell, and Jonathan M. Seymour. Y’all argued that the Supreme Court should put an end to “the unconstitutional practice of nonconsensual third-party releases.” Well, the Supreme Court ruled and we all know how that played out. What is your assessment of the ruling, what are you seeing in chapter 11 cases since, and where do you think we go from here? </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>While in Purdue we made several arguments concerning the constitutionality of non-consensual third-party releases, it’s important to recognize that the Supreme Court’s decision focused on whether the Bankruptcy Code itself authorizes such releases as a matter of statutory interpretation. I wholeheartedly agree with the Court’s finding that it does not, even though the practice of granting these releases in various situations had been adopted by courts for expedient reasons.</em></p><p><em>With that said, there are some open questions following Purdue, and debtors often look for ways to provide releases without running afoul of that decision. For example, in the recent Rockville Centre case, certain insurers were able to obtain releases as part of an asset sale via the free-and-clear mechanism under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. I have no doubt advisors will continue to come up with clever ways to try to accomplish the desired outcome for their clients.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Since we’re on the topic of big name cases with big implications, what is your take on Judge Lopez’s ultimate position in the Robertshaw matter? More broadly, what effect do you anticipate the recent Serta ruling will have? </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em><span>I cannot opine on Judge Lopez’s ruling on the Robertshaw matter since we are currently appealing his ruling on behalf of </span><strong>Invesco</strong><span>. All I will say is that we respectfully disagree with the decision and its rationale.</span></em></p><p><em>The Serta ruling has significant implications, particularly for recent credit agreements of the 2021-2022 vintages, which often include the \"open market purchase\" language at issue in the Serta decision. It complicates LMEs for companies, though some are finding ways to bypass the ruling with alternative mechanisms to effectuate non-pro rata deals. In the evolution of credit agreements, we are also seeing parties clarifying that a privately negotiated deal is allowed under the credit agreement. Parties are now negotiating and actively contracting around the Serta decision.</em></p><p><em>We should also pay attention to the Mitel decision from the Appellate Division in New York, which came down the same day as Serta. The appellate court adopted a more formalistic interpretation of the credit agreement where if the parties stay within the four corners of the agreement, there is no violation of the sacred right even if the LME involves non pro rata treatment of the different lenders.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: More broadly, in the wake of the Serta ruling, what do you think happens in the next wave of LME deals? What were some of the more interesting and perhaps controversial aspects of some of the more recent LME deals where you represented minority lender groups (e.g., Allen Media, Better Health, Del Monte Foods, Ivanti, Magenta, and Newfold Digital). </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>The recent wave of LMEs differs significantly from earlier deals like Serta, Boardriders and TriMark. In those cases, a majority group participated in the deal while minority lenders were entirely excluded. Now, companies are attempting to involve all lenders by structuring LMEs in phases: the initial transaction involves the majority group, while the minority group is later invited to participate—typically on less favorable terms.</em></p><p><em>This creates a challenging dynamic for minority lenders. They often have only a short window, sometimes just seven days, to decide whether to participate. Saying “yes” means accepting worse terms than the majority group. Saying “no,” in the example of a dropdown transaction, could leave them without collateral supporting their loan. It’s a very tough position, and the lack of time for meaningful decision-making exacerbates the issue.</em></p><p><em>To address this, we have been organizing minority lender groups early on, before the LME is announced, and getting our groups to sign cooperation agreements. This proactive approach allows us to engage with the company, improve the group’s position, and, in some cases, become part of the solution by negotiating a holistic deal with the company (even before the LME is announced).</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Staying … 🥱 … on the LME theme for one more beat, can you share your thoughts on the increasing use of cooperation agreements? Do you see any merit to the potential challenges market participants have paraded around with respect to them? </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>Cooperation agreements are by and large a defensive mechanism that lender groups employ to protect their interests. I don't see anything wrong with that. In fact, in some of our minority groups, our clients have signed cooperation agreements to make sure that the group is cohesive and acts in unison as it engages with the company and other groups of lenders. I see it as a positive development in the market.</em></p><p><em>The problem with lender-on-lender violence is that lenders compete with each other, when cooperation will produce a better overall recovery; that’s why we push co-ops. I take no stock in the threats made by debtors against these co-ops. Debtors succeed with LMEs by preying on threats that lenders could be excluded and get a worse deal. Co-ops ensure that no one can be excluded. It’s a legitimate, and frankly, necessary defense mechanism.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: You seem to love underdog situations. You represented the equity committee in Garrett Motion’s bankruptcy and, more recently, Yellow Corporation’s filing. Talk to us about the approach you take as equity committee counsel. Feel free to differentiate between the different fact patterns.</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>I do! I love the fight. Any lawyer or financial advisor can represent an oversecured senior creditor and get them paid in full. Great lawyers and financial advisers are those that can produce a premium recovery when their clients are at risk. I enjoy the challenge of proving valuation and litigation theories to produce premium recoveries. I love the drama and combat in the courtroom (I guess I watched too much LA Law growing up!). But ultimately, having my clients get their recovery is all that matters whether in court or in a settlement.</em></p><p><em><span>Garrett Motion was a turning point in my career. Working with </span><strong>Lorie Beers</strong><span> (now at </span><strong>Intrepid</strong><span>), we executed the same strategy that ultimately prevailed in Hertz. Our official equity committee formulated a competing bid, while litigating a series of issues involving the claim asserting by </span><strong>Honeywell</strong><span>, and we fought the Debtors and their advisors who really did not want us to submit a competing bid. Ultimately, we settled and got the shareholders $13+/per share when the case originally would have given them less than $2 per share. I would have loved to have prevailed, but my clients were thrilled that we leveraged the Chapter 11 process so successfully. I have so much respect for </span><strong>Judge Wiles</strong><span> (my former mentor) who really was instrumental in driving the consensual outcome.</span></em></p><p><em>NOTE: My involvement in Yellow was brief because the folks at Kirkland were doing a solid job of representing the equity.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Speaking of equity committees, Sorrento Therapeutics, whoa boy. What the holy f*ck. That’s not a question, that’s a statement but please feel free to answer it like it’s a question.</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>Sorry, too much trauma!</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: LOL, ooooook. Turning to the next question, then, what should Mom and Pop investors be thinking when they see Glenn Agre saddle up on behalf of equity holders?</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>I’m going to fight for them, just as I would institutional investors. I’m proud that we protected so many people’s investments in Hertz and Garrett Motion. I just wish we could have done the same in Sorrento, which has such a devoted and savvy community.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Another more recent one, True Value. You were conflicts counsel in that one — a weird case if we do say so ourselves given the fact that the debtors didn’t own brick and mortar locations with which they could liquidate inventory to satisfy lenders. Tell us more about what made this case and, frankly, what almost broke it. </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em><span>What made this case was the Debtors’ and the Committee’s professionals. The team at </span><strong>Skadden</strong><span> (</span><strong>Ron Meisler</strong><span>, </span><strong>Fmr. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain</strong><span>, </span><strong>Evan Hill</strong><span>, </span><strong>Steve Daniels</strong><span>) and M3 (</span><strong>Kunal Kamlani</strong><span> and </span><strong>Nick Weber</strong><span>) worked tirelessly to save the True Value franchise by driving a going concern sale to Do-it-Best. </span><strong>Pachulski</strong><span> (</span><strong>Brad Sandler</strong><span> and </span><strong>Paul Labov</strong><span>) supported our efforts to get the sale done.</span></em></p><p><em>The central battle in this case was whether liquidation value outweighed going concern value. In my view, the lenders' insistence on forcing a wholesaler liquidation was totally irrational. It was an untested strategy compared to retailer liquidations, and nobody knew if it could even work. Why would retail outlets that True Value does not control have any incentive to sell our inventory when we were about to shut down? Everyone on our side agreed that liquidation was a recipe for disaster. But the lenders dug in, refusing to allow the use of cash collateral for a going concern sale and only consenting if we agreed to liquidate.</em></p><p><em>Through Skadden and M3’s efforts, the issue became moot when they convinced Do-it-Best to beat the liquidation value. But here’s the fascinating question: can a lender consent to the use of cash collateral and force a debtor to ignore fiduciary duties and sound business judgment to pursue what it believes is a value-maximizing going concern sale? The way I see it, the court is the one that should make that final determination after all bids of all types are in. But ultimately, the court didn’t have to weigh in on this one.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Zooming out, what is the biggest restructuring </strong><em><strong>theme</strong></em><strong> to emerge out of 2024?</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>The biggest restructuring theme of 2024 is the shift in LMEs from outright excluding minority lenders to structuring deals that encourage full participation. However, this doesn’t mean the new wave of LMEs is “kinder” or “gentler,” as some have suggested. Many remain highly coercive and non-pro-rata.</em></p><p><em>What’s changed is that companies have recognized the value in convincing—or coercing—all lenders to participate. This approach minimizes the litigation risk that typically follows an LME.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: What would be your selection for the most </strong><em><strong>impactful</strong></em><strong> restructuring matter of ‘24 and why (don't shamelessly list your own work)? Feel free to acknowledge a matter that filed for chapter 11 or one that restructured out-of-court.</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>The Wesco matter stands out as the most significant restructuring of 2024, particularly in the context of LMEs. The bankruptcy court’s decision was impactful because it set aside the formalities of how the parties structured the LME and focused instead on the substance of the transaction. In my view, the court reached the correct conclusion: if a transaction isn’t permissible in one step, breaking it into multiple steps doesn’t shield it from judicial scrutiny.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: What would be your selection for the most </strong><em><strong>clever</strong></em><strong> restructuring matter of ‘24 and why (don't shamelessly list your own work)? Feel free to acknowledge a matter that filed for chapter 11 or one that restructured out-of-court.</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em><span>Wesco again. People have proposed or threatened plans that preserve litigation rights pending appeal, but the strategy has never worked. I was not part of the case, but I’m guessing that </span><strong>Judge Brendan Shannon</strong><span> did a phenomenal job as mediator to produce the outcome to preserve the business and financial restructuring while the financial creditors fight. I think that’s very clever, and I applaud all the parties for this.</span></em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Put your prediction cap on: what do you think the biggest restructuring theme </strong><em><strong>of ‘25</strong></em><strong> will be?</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>In 2025, we’ll likely see companies and sponsors increasingly structuring LMEs to achieve full participation. This shift is driven, in part, by the litigation risks highlighted in the Serta decision. To mitigate these risks, companies will prioritize strategies that minimize the potential for post-transaction disputes.</em></p><p><em>But I think the LMEs are a cautionary tale for our profession. You have to ask yourself why people are doing these LMEs? The sponsors want runway and to capture discount. This can be accomplished in Chapter 11, but people are avoiding Chapter 11 because it costs too much relative to its benefits. Many LMEs fail because it’s another version of extend-and-pretend. When the Chapter 11 ultimately comes, it’s often an expedited 363 sale with no real restructuring involved. If we don’t improve the Chapter 11 process as a viable alternative to LMEs, there will be fewer Chapter 11s, which ultimately hurts all of us.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: In the US, the industry that sees the most amount of distress in ‘25 will be … which? … and why?</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>All shades of real estate. I think we are in a very big bubble, and trouble is brewing. I hope I’m wrong!</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: The biggest controversy in RX circles in ‘25 will be _________?</strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>Venue. I’ll leave it at that.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Finally, what is one off-the-run issue that keeps popping up in your discussions with clients that not enough people are talking about? </strong></p><p><strong>Andrew: </strong><em>Where can I put money to work? People are looking at more-and-more exotic investments and litigation finance. The opportunity set looks very different and much smaller than a year ago.</em></p><p><strong>PETITION: Thank you Andrew. Wishing you all the best for a successful year. </strong></p><h3>💥21st Annual Wharton Restructuring and Distressed Investing Conference💥</h3><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/27a28a01-bca1-442d-abee-9dee8a072106?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1192,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9332474-905e-4941-8303-eb9e4f175142_1418x851.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>This year the </span><strong>21st Annual Wharton Restructuring and Distressed Investing Conference</strong><span> (“WRDIC”) will be held on Friday, February 21, 2025, at the Plaza Hotel in New York.

I stand by the post, including the two biggest takeaways that I highlighted (emergent chain-of-thought via pure reinforcement learning, and the power of distillation), and I mentioned the low cost (which I expanded on in <a href=\"https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/the-end-of-open-ai-and-microsoft-risks-and-rationale-of-the-stargate-project-deep-seek-r-1-and-bitter-lessons-for-the-future\">Sharp Tech</a>) and chip ban implications, but those observations were too localized to the current state of the art in AI.

In September 2023 Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro with a SMIC-manufactured 7nm chip.

Intel had also made 10nm (TSMC 7nm equivalent) chips years earlier using nothing but DUV, but couldn't do so with profitable yields; the idea that SMIC could ship 7nm chips using their existing equipment, particularly if they didn't care about yields, wasn't remotely surprising — to me, anyways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I totally failed to anticipate was the overwrought reaction in Washington D.C.

I get the sense that something similar has happened over the last 72 hours: the details of what DeepSeek has accomplished — and what they have not — are less important than the reaction and what that reaction says about people's pre-existing assumptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what did DeepSeek announce?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most proximate announcement to this weekend's meltdown was <code>R1</code>, a reasoning model that is similar to OpenAI's <code>o1</code>. However, many of the revelations that contributed to the meltdown — including DeepSeek's training costs — actually accompanied the <code>V3</code> announcement over Christmas. Moreover, many of the breakthroughs that undergirded <code>V3</code> were actually revealed with the release of the <code>V2</code> model last January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this model naming convention the greatest crime that OpenAI has committed?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second greatest; we'll get to the greatest momentarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let's work backwards: what was the V2 model, and why was it important?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DeepSeek-<code>V2</code> model introduced two important breakthroughs: DeepSeekMoE and DeepSeekMLA. The \"MoE\" in DeepSeekMoE refers to \"mixture of experts\". Some models, like GPT-3.5, activate the entire model during both training and inference; it turns out, however, that not every part of the model is necessary for the topic at hand. MoE splits the model into multiple \"experts\" and only activates the ones that are necessary; GPT-4 was a MoE model that was believed to have 16 experts with approximately 110 billion parameters each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeekMoE, as implemented in <code>V2</code>, introduced important innovations on this concept, including differentiating between more finely-grained specialized experts, and shared experts with more generalized capabilities. Critically, DeepSeekMoE also introduced new approaches to load-balancing and routing during training; traditionally MoE increased communications overhead in training in exchange for efficient inference, but DeepSeek's approach made training more efficient as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeekMLA was an even bigger breakthrough. One of the biggest limitations on inference is the sheer amount of memory required: you both need to load the model into memory and also load the entire context window. Context windows are particularly expensive in terms of memory, as every token requires both a key and corresponding value; DeepSeekMLA, or multi-head latent attention, makes it possible to compress the key-value store, dramatically decreasing memory usage during inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I'm not sure I understood any of that.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key implications of these breakthroughs — and the part you need to understand — only became apparent with <code>V3</code>, which added a new approach to load balancing (further reducing communications overhead) and multi-token prediction in training (further densifying each training step, again reducing overhead): <code>V3</code> was shockingly cheap to train. DeepSeek claimed the model training took 2,788 thousand H800 GPU hours, which, at a cost of $2/GPU hour, comes out to a mere $5.576 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That seems impossibly low.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek is clear that these costs are only for the final training run, and exclude all other expenses; from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1\">the <code>V3</code> paper</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>So no, you can't replicate DeepSeek the company for $5.576 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I still don't believe that number.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, the burden of proof is on the doubters, at least once you understand the <code>V3</code> architecture. Remember that bit about DeepSeekMoE: V3 has 671 billion parameters, but only 37 billion parameters in the active expert are computed per token; this equates to 333.3 billion FLOPs of compute per token. Here I should mention another DeepSeek innovation: while parameters were stored with BF16 or FP32 precision, they were reduced to FP8 precision for calculations; 2048 H800 GPUs have a capacity of 3.97 exoflops, i.e. 3.97 billion billion FLOPS. The training set, meanwhile, consisted of 14.8 trillion tokens; once you do all of the math it becomes apparent that 2.8 million H800 hours is sufficient for training <code>V3</code>.

Moreover, if you actually did the math on the previous question, you would realize that DeepSeek actually had an excess of computing; that's because DeepSeek actually programmed 20 of the 132 processing units on each H800 specifically to manage cross-chip communications. <em>This is actually impossible to do in CUDA.</em> DeepSeek engineers had to drop down to PTX, a low-level instruction set for Nvidia GPUs that is basically like assembly language. This is an insane level of optimization that only makes sense if you are using H800s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, DeepSeek also makes their models available for inference: that requires a whole bunch of GPUs above-and-beyond whatever was used for training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So was this a violation of the chip ban?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. H100s were prohibited by the chip ban, but not H800s. Everyone assumed that training leading edge models required more interchip memory bandwidth, but that is exactly what DeepSeek optimized both their model structure and infrastructure around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So <code>V3</code> is a leading edge model?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's definitely competitive with OpenAI's <code>4o</code> and Anthropic's Sonnet-3.5, and appears to be better than Llama's biggest model. What does seem likely is that DeepSeek was able to distill those models to give <code>V3</code> high quality tokens to train on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is distillation?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distillation is a means of extracting understanding from another model; you can send inputs to the teacher model and record the outputs, and use that to train the student model. This is how you get models like GPT-4 Turbo from GPT-4. Distillation is easier for a company to do on its own models, because they have full access, but you can still do distillation in a somewhat more unwieldy way via API, or even, if you get creative, via chat clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distillation obviously violates the terms of service of various models, but the only way to stop it is to actually cut off access, via IP banning, rate limiting, etc. It's assumed to be widespread in terms of model training, and is why there are an ever-increasing number of models converging on GPT-4o quality. This doesn't mean that we know for a fact that DeepSeek distilled 4o or Claude, but frankly, it would be odd if they didn't.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Distillation seems terrible for leading edge models.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is! On the positive side, OpenAI and Anthropic and Google are almost certainly using distillation to optimize the models they use for inference for their consumer-facing apps; on the negative side, they are effectively bearing the entire cost of training the leading edge, while everyone else is free-riding on their investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, this is probably the core economic factor undergirding <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.ieODFNIMwyZH1Uft2QIY3dg0GH4AKFqZu_1_zzfgvTssBI_O98s_AqUGba06AbvIpx0yHhXfWS-kmu3lPUhfdm8_xxh7hVg2n6PcWjk86xGP9Hap8rWQUsFCpeRF1XG5BKhdNITO_IlCcypXYo3tGOIIX91-pKFaDsxRrwZ7BMoFAXIjpTvA5W_IvY_ioF5eT6gzm4YQzheUYcxwY4vGyNsn6U7A4nvwtADtqoTt_pjyMOYLgdqQldialGLpGX4W-khv_pTHSnXvaDwIGbWWK6Gt1N3Js3hf7mNZp1KyEaPspE-JiOupZawv8kucnZClMKLW6308jsgMeyN8AgRbPg\">the slow divorce of Microsoft and OpenAI</a>. Microsoft is interested in providing inference to its customers, but much less enthused about funding $100 billion data centers to train leading edge models that are likely to be commoditized long before that $100 billion is depreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this why all of the Big Tech stock prices are down?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, model commoditization and cheaper inference — which DeepSeek has also demonstrated — is great for Big Tech. A world where Microsoft gets to provide inference to its customers for a fraction of the cost means that Microsoft has to spend less on data centers and GPUs, or, just as likely, sees dramatically higher usage given that inference is so much cheaper. Another big winner is Amazon: AWS has by-and-large failed to make their own quality model, but that doesn't matter if there are very high quality open source models that they can serve at far lower costs than expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also a big winner. Dramatically decreased memory requirements for inference make edge inference much more viable, and Apple has the best hardware for exactly that. Apple Silicon uses unified memory, which means that the CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit) have access to a shared pool of memory; this means that Apple's high-end hardware actually has the best consumer chip for inference (Nvidia gaming GPUs max out at 32GB of VRAM, while Apple's chips go up to 128 GB of RAM).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta, meanwhile, is the biggest winner of all. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/metas-ai-abundance/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.ocWmug0dFVfQeP-seLuyKUBaTj5LWSKPoymvU-iPwJAjmj-fKjFYN9fLtA-6oc-VypiZBTY5C3GRBJ4rDZCt2TJuquWfWFc3laQew_FN9qrlVlOed4lencb-2S-s21AVBWx0za_ZMTXiLC5S8AuBgi1kAxKW_YLn_2qMoE_AtTIVLOZQat37SxVt2AVAtW-grn23AQ3WLm004LcdP9pKZsxmKbJqE93coR8Z1x0PoaAL7HdzLlw81ps-hnJPh4SeJuUAJN-DI_SaXW0oGHWW03VCRoJQQHsepQKbYXS549hEk_JZFNuiDJerwuT9MEC5UWB8Gv7B7mu-qp8sTwWYVQ\">I already laid out last fall</a> how every aspect of Meta's business benefits from AI; a big barrier to realizing that vision is the cost of inference, which means that dramatically cheaper inference — and dramatically cheaper training, given the need for Meta to stay on the cutting edge — makes that vision much more achievable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google, meanwhile, is probably in worse shape: a world of decreased hardware requirements lessens the relative advantage they have from TPUs. More importantly, a world of zero-cost inference increases the viability and likelihood of products that displace search; granted, Google gets lower costs as well, but any change from the status quo is probably a net negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1's existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wait, you haven't even talked about <code>R1</code> yet.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>R1</code> is a reasoning model like OpenAI's <code>o1</code>. It has the ability to think through a problem, producing much higher quality results, particularly in areas like coding, math, and logic (but I repeat myself).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is this more impressive than <code>V3</code>?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, the reason why I spent so much time on <code>V3</code> is that that was the model that actually demonstrated a lot of the dynamics that seem to be generating so much surprise and controversy. <code>R1</code> is notable, however, because <code>o1</code> stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>R1</code> undoes the <code>o1</code> mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can't be replicated. Second, <code>R1</code> — like all of DeepSeek's models — has open weights (the problem with saying \"open source\" is that we don't have the data that went into creating it). This means that instead of paying OpenAI to get reasoning, you can run <code>R1</code> on the server of your choice, or even locally, at dramatically lower cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did DeepSeek make <code>R1</code>?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek actually made two models: <code>R1</code> and <code>R1</code>-Zero.

Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-<code>V3</code>-Base as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-<code>o1</code>-0912.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Reinforcement learning is a technique where a machine learning model is given a bunch of data and a reward function. The classic example is AlphaGo, where DeepMind gave the model the rules of Go with the reward function of winning the game, and then let the model figure everything else on its own. This famously ended up working better than other more human-guided techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc. RLHF was the key innovation in transforming GPT-3 into ChatGPT, with well-formed paragraphs, answers that were concise and didn’t trail off into gibberish, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>R1</code>-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning. DeepSeek gave the model a set of math, code, and logic questions, and set two reward functions: one for the right answer, and one for the right format that utilized a thinking process. Moreover, the technique was a simple one: instead of trying to evaluate step-by-step (process supervision), or doing a search of all possible answers (a la AlphaGo), DeepSeek encouraged the model to try several different answers at a time and then graded them according to the two reward functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What emerged is a model that developed reasoning and chains-of-thought on its own, including what DeepSeek called “Aha Moments”:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The “aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most powerful affirmations yet of <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf\">The Bitter Lesson</a>: you don’t need to teach the AI how to reason, you can just give it enough compute and data and it will teach itself!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, almost: <code>R1</code>-Zero reasons, but in a way that humans have trouble understanding. Back to the introduction:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>However, DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-<code>V3</code>-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-<code>V3</code> in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-<code>V3</code>-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-<code>R1</code>, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-<code>o1</code>-1217.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds a lot like what <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/openais-new-model-how-o1-works-scaling-inference/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.Ww49-rkq6dTVARFJPOpwazLt24372ZupB09SRgF7z0ep0Xc_2r6M8asRJ582URm_f3TJPmAIVstA--dw1p6Wz_5F0xt5_nmYIY2f7vBkE0bWhUO8Q7HoubKKr0YQ0jHSp0T6mp3Y7iAtASSHUNDKSAHbtCB05n9ojo_9vmmStvoCdGrgwbYWaQXEyO9RKYkEiMgQVzRSsagwXzin8EubuZ2Hzaoc6tSPoSp0sxNuGOwklZ2WMzn6uCQ_oznKuls3MmMsoniMoY1cgqERbzwOS0CsXdVvdW10gY0fIbbbX6A-Nu3tLoM5jpgEFxeqkLTTT39NHx5gBZrFSNRzmgNiYg\">OpenAI did for o1</a>: DeepSeek started the model out with a bunch of examples of chain-of-thought thinking so it could learn the proper format for human consumption, and then did the reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning, along with a number of editing and refinement steps; the output is a model that appears to be very competitive with <code>o1</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training <code>R1</code>. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So are we close to AGI?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But isn't <code>R1</code> now in the lead?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't think so; this has been overstated. <code>R1</code> is competitive with <code>o1</code>, although there do seem to be some holes in its capability that point towards some amount of distillation from <code>o1</code>-Pro. OpenAI, meanwhile, has demonstrated <code>o3</code>, a far more powerful reasoning model. DeepSeek is absolutely the leader in efficiency, but that is different than being the leader overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So why is everyone freaking out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are multiple factors. First, there is the shock that China has caught up to the leading U.S. labs, despite the widespread assumption that China isn't as good at software as the U.S.. This is probably the biggest thing I missed in my surprise over the reaction. The reality is that China has an extremely proficient software industry generally, and a very good track record in AI model building specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the low training cost for <code>V3</code>, and DeepSeek's low inference costs. This part was a big surprise for me as well, to be sure, but the numbers are plausible. This, by extension, probably has everyone nervous about Nvidia, which obviously has a big impact on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third is the fact that DeepSeek pulled this off despite the chip ban. Again, though, while there are big loopholes in the chip ban, it seems likely to me that DeepSeek accomplished this with legal chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I own Nvidia! Am I screwed?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are real challenges this news presents to the Nvidia story. Nvidia has two big moats:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>CUDA is the language of choice for anyone programming these models, and CUDA only works on Nvidia chips.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nvidia has a massive lead in terms of its ability to combine multiple chips together into one large virtual GPU.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These two moats work together. I noted above that if DeepSeek had access to H100s they probably would have used a larger cluster to train their model, simply because that would have been the easier option; the fact they didn't, and were bandwidth constrained, drove a lot of their decisions in terms of both model architecture and their training infrastructure. Just look at the U.S. labs: they haven't spent much time on optimization because Nvidia has been aggressively shipping ever more capable systems that accommodate their needs. The route of least resistance has simply been to pay Nvidia. DeepSeek, however, just demonstrated that another route is available: heavy optimization can produce remarkable results on weaker hardware and with lower memory bandwidth; simply paying Nvidia more isn't the only way to make better models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That noted, there are three factors still in Nvidia's favor. First, how capable might DeepSeek's approach be if applied to H100s, or upcoming GB100s? Just because they found a more efficient way to use compute doesn't mean that more compute wouldn't be useful. Second, lower inference costs should, in the long run, drive greater usage. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a late night tweet almost assuredly directed at the market, said exactly that:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1883753899255046301%7Ctwgr%5E308a9508ddcbb816582ab72d5fd9f2475aa348e4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fchrome-headless.local%3A9222%2Fatomic\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/tweet-1883753899255046301.png\"></a></div> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, reasoning models like <code>R1</code> and <code>o1</code> derive their superior performance from using more compute. To the extent that increasing the power and capabilities of AI depend on more compute is the extent that Nvidia stands to benefit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it's not all rosy. At a minimum DeepSeek's efficiency and broad availability cast significant doubt on the most optimistic Nvidia growth story, at least in the near term. The payoffs from both model and infrastructure optimization also suggest there are significant gains to be had from exploring alternative approaches to inference in particular. For example, it might be much more plausible to run inference on a standalone AMD GPU, completely sidestepping AMD's inferior chip-to-chip communications capability. Reasoning models also increase the payoff for inference-only chips that are even more specialized than Nvidia's GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Nvidia isn't going anywhere; the Nvidia stock, however, is suddenly facing a lot more uncertainty that hasn't been priced in. And that, by extension, is going to drag everyone down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what about the chip ban?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest argument to make is that the importance of the chip ban has only been accentuated given the U.S.'s rapidly evaporating lead in software. Software and knowhow can't be embargoed — we've had these debates and realizations before — but chips are physical objects and the U.S. is justified in keeping them away from China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, there should be some humility about the fact that earlier iterations of the chip ban seem to have directly led to DeepSeek's innovations. Those innovations, moreover, would extend to not just smuggled Nvidia chips or nerfed ones like the H800, but to Huawei's Ascend chips as well. Indeed, you can very much make the case that the primary outcome of the chip ban is today's crash in Nvidia's stock price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What concerns me is the mindset undergirding something like the chip ban: instead of competing through innovation in the future the U.S. is competing through the denial of innovation in the past. Yes, this may help in the short term — again, DeepSeek would be even more effective with more computing — but in the long run it simply sews the seeds for competition in an industry — chips and semiconductor equipment — over which the U.S. has a dominant position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Like AI models?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI models are a great example. I mentioned above I would get to OpenAI's greatest crime, which I consider to be the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/\">2023 Biden Executive Order on AI</a>.

This despite the fact that their concern is apparently not sufficiently high to, you know, stop their work. No, they are the responsible ones, the ones who care enough to call for regulation; all the better if concerns about imagined harms kneecap inevitable competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>That paragraph was about OpenAI specifically, and the broader San Francisco AI community generally. For years now we have been subject to hand-wringing about the dangers of AI by the exact same people committed to building it — and controlling it. These alleged dangers were the impetus for OpenAI becoming closed <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/\">back in 2019 with the release of GPT-2</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code⁠(opens in a new window). We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights…We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The arrogance in this statement is only surpassed by the futility: here we are six years later, and the entire world has access to the weights of a dramatically superior model. OpenAI's gambit for control — enforced by the U.S. government — has utterly failed. In the meantime, how much innovation has been foregone by virtue of leading edge models not having open weights? More generally, how much time and energy has been spent lobbying for a government-enforced moat that DeepSeek just obliterated, that would have been better devoted to actual innovation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So you're not worried about AI doom scenarios?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely understand the concern, and just noted above that we are reaching the stage where AIs are training AIs and learning reasoning on their own. I recognize, though, that there is no stopping this train. More than that, this is exactly why openness is so important: we need more AIs in the world, not an unaccountable board ruling all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wait, why is China open-sourcing their model?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well DeepSeek is, to be clear; CEO Liang Wenfeng said in <a href=\"https://www.chinatalk.media/p/deepseek-ceo-interview-with-chinas\">a must-read interview</a> that open source is key to attracting talent:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI’s closed source approach can’t prevent others from catching up. So we anchor our value in our team — our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That’s our moat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The interviewer asked if this would change:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This actually makes sense beyond idealism. If models are commodities — and they are certainly looking that way — then long-term differentiation comes from having a superior cost structure; that is exactly what OpenSeek has delivered, which itself is resonant of how China has come to dominate other industries. This is also contrary to how most U.S. companies think about differentiation, which is through having differentiated products that can sustain larger margins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So is OpenAI screwed?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not necessarily. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2023/the-accidental-consumer-tech-company-chatgpt-meta-and-product-market-fit-aggregation-and-apis/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.us4Sv4K5X9TxrKn9siQApQ3f5FxynFGwJwAyNI3JqtOlZaTCDy2t2xmHS3c8KBji4kAE1qKM68ZHbO-e7iuIAp_gCCe3IjcxlBBmvHzOiJbaPVH9nombsMLvi_ywt8ypDPt1IjHUrWfj0SieZqx32KpVAAY8wSfvqc_YvJm72kk8odQ2qCGDZ92Pvm-HBgJ-V6HirWxFzeB9WicO1JuFYrs3DjMkfuji8pNTpVgIFqyfMkTkSaL1-dUpHXssZ9lGJLeS5W_z9PdvtLAXAskjYbwBsBOJQPluAlNnvS0v4ZyROGaf0Z8CcO8xniED4PFtlpY4VAOxdAFxRtD4qYBL8w\">ChatGPT made OpenAI the accidental consumer tech company</a>, which is to say a product company; there is a route to building a sustainable consumer business on commoditizable models through some combination of subscriptions and advertisements. And, of course, there is the bet on winning the race to AI take-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthropic, on the other hand, is probably the biggest loser of the weekend. DeepSeek made it to number one in the App Store, simply highlighting how Claude, in contrast, hasn't gotten any traction outside of San Francisco. The API business is doing better, but API businesses in general are the most susceptible to the commoditization trends that seem inevitable (and do note that OpenAI and Anthropic's inference costs look a lot higher than OpenSeek because they were capturing a lot of margin; that's going away).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So this is all pretty depressing, then?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, no. I think that DeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services. Jevon's Paradox will rule the day in the long run, and everyone who uses AI will be the biggest winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another set of winners are the big consumer tech companies. A world of free AI is a world where product and distribution matters most, and those companies already won that game; <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7ImFydGljbGUiOiJDS2N1NndtY2R5SGMzZjFmNHk4R0ciLCJhdWQiOlsiUDFOVEMxeHRzUW4xQW1lUld5V3JVayIsIlFiYWgzb2JjcWl0OHQ3RlVNZTVTbXYiLCJKZXJTZFNBaUJ5RmgxZWtZUE1FOW5WIiwiU0FlbVo2eXNGNlVjanpnRUVpY1VkTSIsIllGUGd0N25iZUFOcmlTOFN1dEJwZWMiLCJBczY3UHJkRGpURTRtZnNRWUM3RHJFIl0sImRpc3RybyI6IkNLY3lZTkRDOXlyUkNjUXZIQ3pKdCIsInVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIwL3RoZS1lbmQtb2YtdGhlLWJlZ2lubmluZy8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTc0MDU3OTE1MywiaWF0IjoxNzM3OTg3MTUzLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.ttie_vTOk_bEZKpDRTYUKznLTBUjiNEy0dxSV3BrFR2Gnba3180caPwN8yJsvUCqgSLuwjQvQXWIrGjybO5Hew4FcwEEkSDLDr82bzVyKJAjHcl5L0U0c81rR5nPW8BaWZW_uH6wQG8NKxYa83-fDoxVqp8gGJ4qfWmHPBUVmHwCkblfdU7KqXAANvL0ebUizd_225zSg7Kb9tT7BeJEM2XEgzO_-5cN6HVRSt94fxLWsWoL_AHZDCrfE6aJoouJHY8luGR6CyQEFedYPFI_U5JHLuCoVX5nA-4jMtCzJaywVFuTmjsZvSlAG73veqYiosNt5aEFLnpGZHe7UEmiug\">The End of the Beginning</a> was right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China is also a big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time.

We could, for very logical reasons, double down on defensive measures, like massively expanding the chip ban and imposing a permission-based regulatory regime on chips and semiconductor equipment that mirrors the E.U.s approach to tech; alternatively, we could realize that we have real competition, and actually give ourself permission to compete. Stop wringing our hands, stop campaigning for regulations — indeed, go the other way, and cut out all of the cruft in our companies that have nothing to do with winning. If we choose to compete we can still win, and, if we do, we will have a Chinese company to thank.</p>\n\n                                                                            \n

The move allowed us to consolidate everything into one place: from there on out, Substack powered our website (</span><strong>petition.substack.com</strong><span>) </span><em>and</em><span> our email distribution. No more Mailchimp and no more (need for) Squarespace. </span></p><p>Except, we never really did anything with that old Squarespace site. It just sat there. Dated. Dormant. Pathetic. Taking up critical digital real estate like a zombie. It was time to take it out to the woodshed. </p><p><span>And so this week we did exactly that. In the process, we also took the petition.substack.com URL out with it. </span><strong>From now on, petition11.com is back (baby).</strong><span>** While most of you read us when we conveniently land in your email inbox, some of you do like to go back and read us online, or delve into the archive (available for paying subscribers only).

It was a busy week over here at Not Boring HQ. But you know who certainly had busier weeks? Sam Altman and Donald Trump. Altman unveiled OpenAI’s leadership position in one of history’s largest projects and also released, Operator, a product that many folks believe will change how we get things done. Trump launched $TRUMP on a Friday, was inaugurated on a Tuesday, and introduced a flurry of Executive Orders throughout the rest of the week.

The scale of Stargate lands it in the company of other historically massive projects such as the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Apollo Program, and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. As I said, it doesn’t get much bigger than this.</p><p>The plan is to immediately start deploying $100B and overtime up the investment into things like massive AI data centers, advanced computer and hardware capabilities, and the energy infrastructure needed to power it all. Ideally, this investment will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the U.S., but if it’s successful, you’d also imagine they’ll be a wave of creative job destruction live we’ve never seen before. Stargate is pulling forward the AI revolution and ensuring that revolution happens right here on U.S. soil.</p><p><span>Behind all of the ambition, there’s of course some drama. Who is involved. Who was left out.

It’s all pretty confusing and intertwined…Elon is an ex-OpenAI co-founder, is now suing and competing against OpenAI, while Larry Ellison who is a known Elon-backer, is teaming up with OpenAI to make it all possible, and Trump is seemingly stiff-arming Elon on this deal but elevating him everywhere else. Thankfully, I think all of the gentlemen involved will be A-OK, despite some potential hurt feelings.</span></p><p>If you weren’t long AI before, Stargate should have you reconsidering…</p><p><strong>(1a) Introduction to Operator &amp; Agents</strong></p><p><em>From OpenAI</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Today we introduced a research preview of </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/857b727a-2017-41de-a480-bc6111db3ca6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Operator⁠</a><span>, an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.</span></em></p></blockquote><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/14b1aba7-daae-4727-8347-3fb63310be36?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/CSE77wAdDLg\"></a><p>Big week for Sam!</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, OpenAI released Operator, its computer-using agent that can perform tasks for you. Operator can handle both simple, repetitive tasks as well as more involved tasks that require web browsing and interacting with the digital interface, much like we humans do. It can fill out forms, book reservations, purchase ecommerce goods, etc, etc.</p><p>Operator is powered by the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, combining GPT-4o's vision and advanced reasoning. It interacts with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in a browser, enabling it to perform tasks by “seeing” (via screenshots) and “clicking/typing” like a human. If it gets stuck on things like login, or payment details or recaptcha, it asks for user intervention.</p><p><span>Personally, I am pretty excited to use Operator.

Some of them are really good, in our opinion. And some of them, we don’t fully agree with. Trump’s Executive Order on American Energy is fits into the first category. </p><p>The EO prioritizes domestic energy production, resource independence, and affordability by removing regulatory barriers and revoking climate-focused policies from prior administrations.

The vision for the company is to build a logistics network of autonomous drones to deliver both critical and non-critical items to people, no matter where they live. Think of Zipline delivering life-saving medicine to an 85 year old in rural Tennessee that would otherwise have to drive an hour to their local pharmacy. Or think of a lazy 28 year old getting Buffalo Wild Wings airdropped to them at 3:00pm ET on a playoff football Sunday. Zipline can, theoretically, do both. Go Birds. </p><p>The company completed its first delivery using its new Platform 2 delivery system. P2 is a new precise and nearly silent drone system designed for both urban and rural environments. It uses autonomous droids for doorstep deliveries and electric drones. It’s the company’s play into doing more retail and ecommerce deliveries.</p><p>Its first mission, however, was delivering supplies to firefighters taking on the LA fires. It’s more symbolic than anything.

I remember Packy, who is 8 years older than me, basically sitting me down and saying something to the effect of: “you don’t have any excuses, there is some much information out there to learn, just start listening to podcasts, try Tim Ferriss to get started.” Since then, I’ve been pretty addicted to podcasts and I think they’ve changed the curve of my life. </p><p>One of the first episodes that really got me hooked was Chris Sacca’s first appearance on Tim Ferriss. Here was this Georgetown alumnus, who seemed like we could’ve been friends if we attended school at the same time, who had grinded his way into a career in tech and launched the best performing VC fund of all-time. It made things seem more attainable for me, and in many ways, gave me a kick in the pants I needed. As odd as it seems, I credit many of the positive things that have happened in my life over the past ten years to listening to that episode.</p><p>Anyway, Sacca was back on Tim’s pod again and did not disappoint.

And now, </span><em>Living on Earth</em><span>, which just so happens to describes the entanglement of animals (insects!) and the emergence of the most successful plants on earth, the monocots, or flowering plants. And what flower might be the best stand in for the ur-flower? The magnolia, of course, pollinated by beetles, not bees, which did not yet exist.

Plants, themselves, owe their lifeway to former free-living bacteria that came aboard to make usable energy from photons. And then, perhaps 120 million years ago, they evolved what we call flowers. </p><p>“[P]lants could now interact at a distance, in a way mediated by the perceptions, nervous systems, and actions of animals,” he writes. “Insects became, in a sense, instruments used by plants to span space.” </p><p>And this partnership led to an explosion of evolutionary success for the bloom and the beetle, alike. Maybe, in my animal brain, that is part of the vibrating, deep appeal of these flowers. This, perhaps, is why I watch their development with such interest.  Perhaps there are forms of basic attraction, of want, that we humans have extended into something we call beauty. But still, at its origin, perhaps there is something hungrier and more necessary than it seems wise to admit. </p><p>I like to imagine that we may share some core bits, some physical intuitions, some ideas of what is good going back very, very, very far. I’m not sure how much to trust this, but Godfrey-Smith’s view of the evolution and continuity of life lets me dream into this space. </p><p>“It’s not that you will have inherited particular material parts from some ancient life-form, but that there is a chain of such relationships—the cells in you containing parts of earlier cells, which contained parts of earlier ones, and so on,” he writes. “When we look back then, it’s not just that we are living organisms, examples of life, and such things were around back then as well. And it’s not just that the link of reproduction has been present since then, with old organisms somehow making new ones. We are also a material continuation of what was here before… Our ties to ancient life-forms are not just a matter of causal connection. A stronger bond connects old and new organisms, projecting life through time, and this bond has been in place for most of the history of the Earth and much of the history of the universe.” </p><p>The magnolia, then, is also an ode to the cyanobacteria and to the beetles. It’s a reminder of the partnerships in nature, and an avatar of deep time, and a gorgeous  bloom perched on the still bare branches of my tree, and the feeling I get peering down into the mystery at its center. Or, to quote Godfrey-Smith one last time:</p><p>“Wanting is an evolutionary product, something that evolution brought into the world,” he writes. “But once wanting exists, it can take animals in all sorts of novel directions.” </p></div>",

Whoever operates at the higher layer uses others’ work as input.</p><p>Raise your hand if you know who Marcel Grossmann is. A few physics fans in the back. I see you. For everyone else, here’s a little story.</p><p>In 1907, Albert Einstein had what he would call his “happiest thought,” born of his very human intuition: “The gravitational field has only a relative existence… Because for an observer freely falling from the roof of a house - at least in his immediate surroundings - there exists no gravitational field.”</p><p>For the next four years, he struggled to turn that happy thought into a coherent theory. Simple mathematics couldn’t deal with the audacity of his insight. Specifically, simple mathematics couldn’t handle the accelerating reference frames that he imagined.</p><p>In 1912, he took a professorship in theoretical physics at ETH Zurich, where he reconnected with an old mathematician classmate: Marcel Grossmann.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8115516c-6164-4641-8960-ac4d1ede7f45?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F080e4d65-c481-41e4-844a-0463129de24c_908x360.png\"></a></figure></div><p>It was Grossmann who realized that Riemannian geometry and tensor calculus, both of which existed purely in the world of pure mathematics because physics hadn't yet had a need for them, might do the trick. God doesn’t play dice: he had the math waiting when Einstein needed it, and Grossmann to bridge the gap.</p><p><span>They bridged the gap in 1912 and 1913. The two wrote a paper together, “</span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1c9ca0bd-9c40-4d9c-8601-e1c5fc7b0f50?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Entwurf</a><span>,” coming close to General Relativity (GR), but the equations weren’t quite right yet.</span></p><p>Grossmann went back to his work. Einstein spent the next two years struggling with various versions of the field equations, trying to make it tie out. For a time, the math was so hard that he went back to simpler approaches.</p><p>In 1915, he realized that he had to stick with the tensor approach, worked intensely for a few weeks, and finally arrived at the correct field equations of GR. He presented them to the Prussian Academy of Sciences over four weekly lectures.</p><p>Einstein unlocked the universe.</p><p><span>For more than a century, GR has passed every experimental test thrown at it, often with remarkable precision. Even ideas that seem to break the known laws of physics may just be engineering skill issues. In 2010, Hal Puthoff wrote a paper, </span><span> that suggested that observations of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs, or what we used to called UFOs) – things like time manipulation, faster than light travel, and antigravity – can all fit with within GR.</span></p><p>Einstein commoditized Grossmann, in a way. He used Grossman’s output as his input, while he himself provided the spark that could not be reduced, the intuition, and the drive to see it through for nearly a decade, a drive perhaps only possible if you yourself experienced the spark.</p><p>“Commoditized” is not a knock against Grossmann.</p><p>Einstein’s intuitive gift was made more valuable by the commoditization of its complement: the mathematics required to turn it into a theory. Without Grossmann, you may not know Einstein.</p><p><span>We imagine the word </span><em>commoditized</em><span> as an insult, but </span><em>rare </em><span>commodities can be very valuable indeed. Give me an ounce of Rhodium, even a </span><em>gram</em><span> of Painite, Tritium, or, better, Californium any day.</span></p><p>If you look up “commodity” in the dictionary, you’ll find this secondary definition: “something of use, advantage, or value.”</p><p>At the time Grossmann constructed the mathematical bridge that made General Relativity reachable, his mathematical ability was a very rare commodity indeed. You had to be Albert Einstein and hold a professorship at ETH Zurich to access it. If Grossmann’s mathematical talent was a commodity, it was Rhodium ($20,880 per ounce) than Chlorine (8 cents per kg).</p><p>What is fascinating is that, now, 113 years later, math is becoming Chlorine.</p><p>I just had this exchange with o1 pro:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e178844e-2cef-4304-bc32-20e4cd57f326?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1904,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1fcb8f8-2100-4a9c-80fd-4a226404d54f_952x279.png\"></a></figure></div><p>I told it I was Einstein, gave it my happiest thought, and asked it to help me with the math.</p><p>It did, in a couple minutes. Marcel Grossmann, included in a $200 per month subscription.</p><p>Of course, it has the benefit of knowing what Grossmann did. And Grossmann himself made an intuitive leap; it was not obvious that Riemannian geometry and tensor calculus held the key. o1 pro did not have to make that same leap. It just had to do some math.</p><p>But the trend is clear: answers to even very hard questions are becoming cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. Which means the ability to ask them is getting more and more and more valuable.</p><p>In other words, the cheaper Grossmann becomes, the more valuable Einstein becomes.</p><h3><strong>A Strategy Memo for Humans</strong></h3><p>This is very good news or very bad news depending on your skills and aspirations.</p><p>What is clear, though, is that it is not a simple situation.

It started as a normal strategy essay.</p><p>I had six strategies companies have historically used for dealing with commoditization at one layer of the stack – similar to those in the One Strategy section – and that was pretty much going to be the payload.</p><p>The idea was simple:</p><ol><li><p>Some human skills are being commoditized.</p></li><li><p>Things get commoditized all the time.</p></li><li><p>Here are the strategies that people and businesses have used to compete.</p></li></ol><p>Even that idea was an evolution. I started thinking about something like this piece over the break, but it was a different idea then. Something about how I was planning to approach 2025 differently as a window into what I think will be a particularly crazy year: less scheduled, because you want to be long optionality into increasing volatility, for example. There was going to be something about writing fewer, deeper pieces, and about leaving room to experiment.</p><p>I probably have eight or nine drafts of different versions of this thing. I’ve been working on them for the past three weeks. I was going to send on the 7th, then the 14th, even yesterday. But the drafts weren’t right, so I didn’t send.</p><p>I guess I will write about those other things I was going to write about now, because they’re pertinent.</p><p><span>Last year, I might have just hit send on a polished version of one of those earlier drafts. Everything was set up to do that: we booked sponsors into individual dates, and had a packed calendar. (Awesome work, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a8176a24-9030-4b32-a3c8-7b6acdb265cf?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Nancy</a><span>!) I wouldn’t have sent anything I wasn’t proud of, but I would have slammed coffee and sprinted to the deadline. I can’t tell you how many essays I reworked starting at 4am on Tuesday morning last year. And it worked well enough; I was happy with last year’s writing, though it can always improve.</span></p><p>For 2025, though, I wanted to give my essays more room to breathe. I want more time to go really, really deep on Deep Dives. And I want weirder ideas to have time to evolve.</p><p><span>One thing we did was change how we do sponsors. We now have three presenting sponsors for 2025 that I’m honored to be telling you about more consistently: </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/34b11119-103d-478c-92df-7483b5f6f4a8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Rox</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a8e5581f-0586-4abf-89b4-990bc25dd04d?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Ramp</a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/107139b3-c287-48f1-b3ff-934c900e8b55?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Vanta</a><span>. If you need sales, finance, or compliance – and every company does – go say thanks to them to kick us off on the right foot. Importantly, they don’t have set dates. Whenever I send an essay, one of the three will sponsor it. So if a piece just isn’t there, I don’t hit send.</span></p><p>I have to be honest. Not sprinting against a deadline felt weird. I moved out of the home office and into a real office for the first time in five years at the beginning of the year, and it’s quiet. I thought maybe it was too quiet to be productive. It felt lazy not getting anything out.</p><p>At the same time, though, just getting things out is no longer valuable, to the extent that it ever was. Or, it’s less valuable than ever. Even pretty good writing is commoditized.</p><p>So I kept banging my head against this piece, trying to write something that wasn’t just slop, even good slop. Trying to write something unique on a topic a lot of smart people (and even more smart AIs) have written about.</p><p>I meditated a lot, too. I’ve meditated every day for the past 45 days, since the day I decided to start meditating. Some days for as few as 10 minutes, some for as many as 90. For the first time in an adult life of trying to meditate because I thought I should, this time actually feels like something in my brain is changing, even if it’s subtle.</p><p><span>That, too, weirded me out! I’ve been worried that I’ve gotten too chill and detached, that I’d “one shotted” myself as the kids say. I haven’t felt very stressed, when in the past, not sending anything for a few weeks would have really stressed me out. But </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/13172381-7bc4-4c3c-8fe8-1f6054a1cb7e?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Trust the Process</a><span>, as they say.</span></p><p>Then last week, something interesting started happening.</p><p>On Friday, I came into the office, meditated, and then had the insight at the beginning of this piece: niti niti economics.</p><p><span>On Saturday, on my commute in, I decided to go no headphones and just let myself think. I’ve also been reading a bunch of seemingly random things and letting them clank around my brain, including </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/abf45942-947e-4691-9225-f0ef9dcf81d7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">There is No Antimemetics Division</a></em><span> and the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/16975653-21e9-4547-a80f-693502fd099a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">CIA Reading Room</a><span>. While I was walking and thinking, another idea hit me: do an old-school memo. The memorandum linked above is the result.</span></p><p><span>Then on Monday, I commuted without headphones again, and as I was about to get into the subway, a final idea struck: that in the end, what all of this is for is to maximize novel human experience, relations, and love. That one clearly came from the work I did for </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/989a1654-a693-43d8-b5c2-d467489c3be9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Return of Magic</a><span> </span></em><span>and related reading over the break, but it struck me like a bolt that that’s the economic end game, too. That we want to live longer and travel further and accumulate more resources in order to experience more of what it means to be human. When you strip it all away, that’s the uniquely human thing, and something that even the best competition can’t take away.</span></p><p>I stopped, recorded the idea into Claude, asked for feedback, and chatted the whole way in, working on the idea, refining it, beating it up. When I got into the office, I incorporated it into the piece, then kept refining, adding, cutting. All the way, both Claude and ChatGPT provided feedback, some useful, some less so. The feedback I dismiss the most quickly is the feedback that tries to add too much polish. I want this one to be weird.</p><p>I even got their help writing out mathematical proofs for some of the ideas in the piece, something I simply never would have included before but can now, practically for free. I’m not sure it adds too much, besides a little Grossmann callback, but it’s a newly commoditized ingredient that I can throw in the mix. I don’t expect it to become a constant.</p><p><span>Anyway, I’m not sure this essay is strictly </span><em>better</em><span> than anything ChatGPT or Claude or DeepSeek or Grok will be able to write in a year, but it’s certainly different. And personally, the experience of those AHA! moments and the realization that strategy and religion/mysticism point to the same truth were experiences worth having. I hope reading them is a good experience.</span></p><p>Now I’ve written it. These ideas are now a commodity. Take them, remix them, incorporate them, build on them, or even throw them out, leave them sitting in the back of your head until they might be of use.</p><p><span>This will be a theme of 2025. Understand what was formerly scarce and is now commoditized. Don’t shrink from it. Play with it. Experiment. See what it can do that you used to have to do. Learn what </span><em>you </em><span>can do with it that you couldn’t before.</span></p><p><span>At Not Boring, we’re going to experiment a ton. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5b16cf64-3d87-4da7-bcba-8a195ad819b5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Aman</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/373129f2-e7bb-468e-a14b-7387fa9f498b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Sehaj</a><span> are cooking up new tools, like the agents behind </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8508114d-cb81-4910-974e-7e26ab4dead3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Boring News</a><span>, </span><em>and </em><span>the three of us are coming up with ideas for things we couldn’t have previously done without them.

Better luck next year, “Dry January.”</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Okay, that’s better. </span><em>Good. G-d. </em><span>It’s only </span><em>January</em><span>, and we already have a contender for the sloppiest bankruptcy of the year. It would be more efficient to cover what’s gone right with this company, but that’s not the kind of shop we run so let’s dive in ⬇️.</span></p><p><span>With humble beginnings in mid-to-late ‘90s Los Angeles, the company is “</span><em>a significant provider of healthcare services</em><span>” and “</span><em>experienced remarkable growth … evolving into a multi-billion-dollar healthcare system dedicated to serving</em><span> </span><em>underserved communities</em><span>.” Clearly, in addition to serving, they were dedicated to billing. After being acquired by LGP in a ‘10 LBO, and straight out of PE-playbook, the company set its sights beyond the Golden State and went on an debt-fueled acquisition spree, buying up facilities in Texas, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut from ‘12 through ‘16.

PHFM is the “</span><em>member-manager</em><span>” of PHP Holdings,** and as their names suggest, HospitalCo owns and operates the hospitals, while PhysicianCo houses mostly-services-based operations: healthcare plans, medical groups, management services, and a pharmacy. We say “mostly” because, for some reason, PhysicianCo also has one hospital under its purview, 🤷‍♀️.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a15bb5bf-5439-48e2-a631-ffad8add168c?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1063cfb7-cf3d-414a-be2e-60bec7de8160_767x404.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 41</figcaption></figure></div><p>To fund that transcontinental growth and related CapEx,*** the company, naturally, levered up and, as of the petition date, had ~$2.3 billion in funded debt, for which the debtors were directly on the hook for ~$1.1b and, after including guaranties, ~$1.5b.**** Here’s the cap stack:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b8d677bb-8a49-4e57-99fe-ea474fe864eb?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1240,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758e405c-4d08-489c-bbff-7725c88bb8ae_728x394.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 41</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>That elegant two-silo structure 👆 there was born in ‘23 out of the company’s most recent, non-bankruptcy financing: a “</span><em>comprehensive</em><span>” liability management transaction (the “LMT”) with </span><strong>Centerbridge Credit CS, L.P.</strong><span> (“Centerbridge”), </span><strong>Blue Torch Capital L.P.</strong><span> (“Blue Torch”), and </span><strong>Medical Properties Trust, Inc.

The company entered into the LMT because, and this will be a persistent theme, it is a bottomless cash pit and needed more to keep the doors open and, when not busy gutting services, patients tended to. Under the LMT, (i) MPT agreed to reduce obligations owed to it by $646mm for a 49% ownership stake in PHP Holdings (PMH owns the other 51%) and convertible notes, which, if exercised, would increase its stake to ~83%, and (ii) Centerbridge and Blue Torch, true to its name, torched $375mm of new money, used to pay off the company’s then-existing debt and transaction costs, fulfill regulatory capital requirements, and “</span><em>allow PMH to catch up on certain outstanding accounts payables amounts</em><span>” — not a penny went to the company’s coffers.</span></p><p>Are you waiting with

Yu.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/asianometry-1-1024x1024.png\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Asianometry is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Asianometry\">one of the best tech YouTube channels in existence</a>, with over 768,000 subscribers. Jon produces in-depth videos explaining every aspect of technology, with a particular expertise in semiconductors. To give you an idea of Jon's depth, he has made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtxx9TnH76SRC7ZbOu2Nsg5mC72fy-GZ\">31 videos about TSMC alone</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtxx9TnH76QY5FjmO3NaUkVJvTPN9Vmg\">semiconductor course</a> includes 30 videos covering everything from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihz2WY-E2C8&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76QY5FjmO3NaUkVJvTPN9Vmg&amp;index=2&amp;pp=iAQB\">designing chips</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIO7aRXUCg&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76QY5FjmO3NaUkVJvTPN9Vmg&amp;index=4&amp;pp=iAQB\">how ASML builds EUV machines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRJgvX6P8dI&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76QY5FjmO3NaUkVJvTPN9Vmg&amp;index=20&amp;pp=iAQB\">Moore's Law</a>. His video on the end of Dennard's Law is a particular standout:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7p8ZeSbblec?si=7lsVdhKiD0Nu9QRe\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/youtube-7p8ZeSbblec.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon is about more than semiconductors though: he's made videos about other tech topics like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47ovT_hYlt8&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76RKmJlFIfs7NumNp1RPNIQv&amp;index=4&amp;pp=iAQB\">The Tragedy of Compaq</a>, and non-tech topics like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19l7WkkwYi8&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76RKmJlFIfs7NumNp1RPNIQv&amp;index=5&amp;pp=iAQB\">Japanese Whisky</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKBY-MJFJ4A&amp;list=PLKtxx9TnH76RKmJlFIfs7NumNp1RPNIQv&amp;index=6&amp;pp=iAQB\">Taiwan convenience stores</a>. In short, Jon is an intensely curious person who does his research, and we are blessed that he puts in the work to share what he learns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am blessed most of all, however. Over the last year Jon has been making <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Stratechery\">Stratechery Articles into video essays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SharpTechPodcast\">cutting clips for Sharp Tech</a>; he did a great job with one of my favorite articles of 2024:</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cgjWHzFdj4?si=wzdTd1X144pDIwcJ\"><img src=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/assets/youtube-3cgjWHzFdj4.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, starting today, Stratechery Plus subscribers can get exclusive access to Asianometry's content in newsletter and podcast form. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Asianometry\">Asianometry YouTube Channel</a> will remain free and Jon's primary focus, but from now on all of his content will be simultaneously released as a transcript and podcast. Stratechery Plus subscribers can <a href=\"https://asianometry.passport.online/member/\">head over to the new Asianometry Passport site</a> to subscribe to his emails, or to add the podcast feed to

(Justin Alberto, Stacy Newman, Jack Dougherty) as legal counsel and </span><strong>FTI Consulting, Inc.

Pay no mind to this wee little bird.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The UCC had a whole smörgåsbord of DIP issues, some typical UCC stuff (waivers, pre-petition debt roll-ups, challenge period of liens, *yawn*), others less so (the budget’s failure to fully pay 503(b)(9) claims).**** Landlords, however, had a narrower complaint: “</span><em>… [the budget] did not provide any assurance that Stub Rent would be paid…,</em><span>” which, of course, the UCC b*tched about too.***** For those not in the know, stub rent is one of those damn pesky administrative expenses that have to be paid in full to confirm any BK plan. But the debtors were able to quell those concerns and squeak through the final DIP hearing by revising the final order to provide “</span><em>funding</em><span>” for stub rent payments and giving the debtors “</span><em>… authority, but not direction, to draw upon any ABL DIP Availability to provide for such funding[.]</em><span>” That language is going to come back to bite folks in the a$$, but, whatever, aside from a few dead canaries, nothing seemed amiss, and the court entered the final DIP order on October 22, 2024.</span></p><p><span>A couple of days later, and after some delay and a modification or two,****** the court also approved the debtors’ bidding procedures on October 25, 2024, officially blessing Nexus’s asset purchase agreement (the “Nexus APA”) to serve as the stalking horse bid and sending the debtors off … on a short dash? Whatever it was, it wasn’t a race. Under the procedures, bids were due October 28, which … *give us a moment, need to pull out a calendar* was a whopping three days later, two of which were the weekend. Uhhh, what? No doubt you’ll be flabbergasted to learn that not a single person submitted a qualified bid, although </span><strong>Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC</strong><span> (“GBRP”),******* the debtors’ store closing consultant, did drop an unqualified one on the debtors. Beyond its consultant hat, GBRP just happens be to an affiliate of </span><strong>1903P Loan Agent, LLC</strong><span> (“1903 Agent”) and </span><strong>1903 Partners, LLC </strong><span>(together with 1903 Agent, the “1903 Parties”), the former of which is the debtors’ pre-petition and DIP term loan agent and both of which are lenders under those facilities and own a majority of that debt.******** So safe to say that bid was submitted solely out of GBRP’s own interest in the debtors’ assets, had nothing to do with salvaging the term loan if the Nexus deal ran into a wall (spoiler alert: it did), and these dynamics presented no conflict of interest whatsoever for anyone,🙄. Christ. Weeks later, the court approved the Nexus sale on November 22.********* During the hearings, the debtors stressed:</span></p><pre><code><code>“...it was imperative to swiftly close the Nexus Sale to avoid business deterioration resulting from a prolonged stay in bankruptcy and weakening confidence from the Debtors’ commercial counterparties regarding the Debtors’ financial capacity to continue operating as a going-concern.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Well, that didn’t happen, and </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/5325af14-8090-4768-931e-b4f796b56711?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Norfolk Southern</a></strong><span> now celebrates no longer having title to the most recent, Ohio-based train wreck. Here’s the debtors’ post-mortem:</span></p><pre><code><code>“Despite the Herculean efforts to prepare the estates for the sale transaction, on December 1, 2024, Nexus informed the Debtors that it would need more time to close and identified a new target closing of December 10 or 11, 2024—which dates would still permit the Debtors to satisfy the sale closing milestone of December 13, 2024 contemplated by the Debtors’ DIP Facilities … However, on December 5, 2024, the Debtors received a letter from Nexus notifying the Debtors that the minimum asset value closing condition set forth in … the Nexus APA would not be satisfied … [and] caution[ing] that ‘there [was] a significant capital need’ in order to close the Nexus Sale … The Debtors’ advisors were subsequently informed by Nexus’s advisors that this ‘significant capital need’ was approximately $75 million.” (emphasis added).</code></code></pre><p><em><strong>SEVENTY-FIVE. MILLION. DOLLARS!</strong><span> </span></em><span>Put another way, the debtors only needed roundabouts </span><em>214%</em><span> of the new money DIP to get to a close.

But the i’s hadn’t been dotted nor the t’s crossed, so they still had some wood to chop.</span></p><p>Right around the time the debtors received GBRP’s bid, (i) landlords took note that deposits for September stub rent were still curiously missing from their bank accounts and asked the court to hold a status conference, and (ii) the UCC filed a motion to compel payment of that stub rent and 503(b)(9) claims or, alternatively, convert the cases to chapter 7s.</p><p><span>Keenly interested in learning more about this burning trash heap, the court teed them up for a December 19, 2024 hearing. What did the debtors tell us at that hearing? Nothing we couldn’t have guessed. The cases were a total f*cking disaster, no one was happy — in fact, most were quite pissed off, the debtors had no budget or clear path forward, stub rent hadn’t been paid (remember that language ⬆️ that resolved the DIP? The debtors took the position that “</span><em>funding</em><span>” and “</span><em>authority, but not direction</em><span>” meant f*ck-all, nothing required actual payment), administrative expenses were growing on the daily (on which, the court remarked, “</span><em>…I do appreciate, you know, the landlords are taking a big risk here and so are the other administrative creditors, including professionals, in this case.</em><span>”), and GUCs were — how do we put this delicately? — ABSOLUTELY F*CKED.</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e147b227-01f0-4626-a67d-11991ae3bd0c?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_504,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa44f401e-44e5-4859-80cc-7680513caa46_1485x1047.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: PETITION Meme Department.

Not to be outdone by </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e0d6bba1-275d-4b74-8cb4-2521632d5f0a?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Franchise Group, Inc.</a><span>, these hearings were looooooooooooooooooooooong as f*ck. Over TEN HOURS of our lives were sucked away, and we’re never getting them back. And unlike Franchise Group’s, they weren’t even that entertaining! We’d consider filing an admin claim for the suffering we endured, but with the recovery non-professional admin creditors are gonna get, and tossing in two bucks of our own, we’d be able to buy a sh*tty cup of gas station coffee.</span></p><p>At the hearing, every admin creditor about to get boned and the US trustee (the “UST”) had thoughts on notice — as in, there wasn’t any. When that issue and related discovery concerns were raised by a vendor, Davis Polk actually had the balls to say this out loud:</p><pre><code><code>“[F]or parties who wish to serve discovery, you know, they were certainly able to in advance of the hearing today.”</code></code></pre><p>What? When? You filed a motion on a Friday for hearing on Monday. This sh*t can only be said in bankruptcy court — any other court would laugh these jokers right out of the room. We’ll spare you a few details, but Judge Stickles concluded that some business-day discovery was warranted and kicked everything out … by one day, giving creditors and the UST the option of deposing the debtors’ witness that evening or early the next morning and otherwise preparing for trial. After what was assuredly a relaxing, sleep-filled night, everyone got back together the next morning. Picking up where they left off, the debtors made a handful of points: (i) the GBRP-Variety deal was the best deal the debtors were going to get, (ii) the UCC supported it, (iii) liquidating was a straight-up worse alternative, and (iv) the payment of professionals was no biggie because the DIP’s carve-out and escrow funding already took care of them (again, must be nice to have that pen in hand, and certainly not one of the reasons the UCC supported the deal).</p><p>The UST and vendors made their arguments too: the deal needed additional funding for administrative expenses, including the payment of UST fees (which will screech to a halt the week of January 25, 2025), the hearing should be kicked out, or the cases converted to 7 because the debtors shouldn’t be allowed to pick and choose which admin creditors get paid. But it’s bankruptcy court, and while Delaware’s admittedly less egregious than other venues, debtors generally get away with waving their arms while screaming the sky is falling. The court approved the sale, of course, and it closed on January 3, 2025.</p><p>Since then, creditors have carpet bombed the debtors’ docket with requests for payment of their administrative expenses. We’re not kidding — over 50 motions have been filed so far, asserting millions and millions of dollars worth of claims, and the figure keeps growing.*********** Topping off this sh*t sundae, Nexus dropped a couple juicy cherries in the form of two motions: one to compel the debtors to repay Nexus for its expenses and return its $2.5mm deposit and another to compel the debtors to pay Nexus its $7.5mm break-up fee after the GBRP sale closed, all as required under the Nexus APA.</p><p>This thing is going to convert to 7, there’s no way around it. Taking one landlord at his word, the magnitude of administrative expenses is pushing upwards of $300mm, all accrued within three and a half months. The next hearing is slated for January 21, 2025, and we’ll keep you posted as this mound of refuse burns out.</p><p>Best of luck to all vendors, landlords, and everyone else left holding the bag. Doubtless, the estates’ lawyers, bankers, and financial advisors are sending thoughts and prayers.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6a619af5-25f3-412e-adcb-01aa96ed755f?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2495b21-e3e0-44c1-95fb-0d0e0f32f284_400x231.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><h5><span>* We specify “post-filing” because we saw this train wreck coming from a mile away.

Overtime, however, the company will likely manage to make their rockets reusable and fully compete with SpaceX in the heavy-lift launch market.</p><p>Bezos and Musk, arguably the two greatest entrepreneurs of our generation, are going at it in space. Musk has an early and considerable lead, but I wouldn’t be quick to countout Bezos. There are really no losers in this race: Jeff and Elon will both be A-OK if they never launch another rocket and everyone else will benefit from these two pioneers racing to colonize space.</p><p><strong>(1a) SpaceX Super Heavy Booster Catch</strong></p><p><em>From SpaceX</em></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6e8e9c78-a261-42bd-9846-4ede0e395e27?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/z_F_PKXxCDE\"></a><p>As if on queue, just a couple of hours after I wrote the above section on Blue Origin, SpaceX’s Mechazilla caught a super heavy booster for the second time.

Firefly’s Blue Ghost, part of NASA’s CLPS program, plans to land in March with 10 payloads to study the moon’s surface.</p><p>The moon’s resurgent importance is driven by three factors. First, and perhaps more rationally, the moon is seen as a jumping off point for future space exploration, with potential resources like water ice that can support in-space applications, like fuel production.

W-2 carried a payload including a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and a pharmaceutical reactor, designed to advance space-based manufacturing.</p><p>W-2 is in-orbit and commissioned, Varda is in contact with it, and over the next couple of weeks, it will be doing a little in-space manufacturing. Then, it will re-enter, test a spectrometer for AFRL, and land in Australia. That’ll be a g’day for space. </p><p>The launch was part of The Prometheus program, a partnership between Varda and the AFRL aimed at advancing the latter’s high-hypersonic systems and reentry technologies. The program is a great example of public, private partnership — through 2028 the two organizations are expected to complete dozens of iterative test launches — something you can’t imagine a the AFRL executing without the help of a fast-moving startup like Varda. </p><p>And for Varda, this type of revenue-generating partnership will allow it to advance its tech, learn a ton, and hit necessary milestones on it’s way towards ultimately making in-space manufacturing and re-entry as common as launch is becoming today.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong><span> </span><strong>Woolly Mammoth, Dodo Get Another Shot as Startup Raises $200 Million</strong></p><p><em>Sarah McBride for Bloomberg</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>A biotechnology startup working to bring back animals from extinction has raised $200 million at a valuation of $10.2 billion, more than six times its valuation just two years ago. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/484cb73b-bb2f-4fc4-ad40-bcf1a38ff2f3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Colossal Biosciences Inc.</a><span> is using DNA and genomics to try to </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1ae892cf-cec7-4778-8679-43b2d13c88b6?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">resurrect the dodo</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a4e31f05-e250-4bfe-a13f-ad2a9d38baa2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Tasmanian tiger</a><span> and the woolly mammoth.</span></em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/157545db-ed3e-447d-9f89-0d5e797691db?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0a6b685-9c6b-46a3-a52f-e0f53af3576f_2000x1333.webp\"></a></figure></div><p>Colossal Biosciences has about as ambitious of a mission of any company you’ll come across: use cutting-edge genetic engineering and synthetic biology to \"de-extinct\" species.

The plan is to splice mammoth DNA with that of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, using advanced CRISPR gene-editing techniques. The resulting hybrid embryos will then be implanted into elephant surrogates. Once born, the plan is for the calfs to be reintroduced into Arctic tundra.</p><p>Which is incredibly cool.

MatterGen uses a diffusion model tailored for 3D materials, generating novel structures by iteratively refining random inputs based on design prompts. It then adjusts atomic positions, elements, and lattice periodicity to meet specified chemical, mechanical, or electronic property constraints. This process means its can generate materials that have specific traits, such as strength, conductivity, or magnetic properties.</p><p>MatterGen is a game changer because it allows researchers to design materials for specific needs, rather than relying on slow trial-and-error methods of material discovery. For example, imagine you work on battery design and you could prompt the model (in very simplified terms): “Generate a material with high electrical conductivity, low weight, and stability at high temperatures.” And then you can iterate from there to meet the specific needs of your battery’s needs.</p><p>MatterGen isn’t just theoretical.

There’s been a perfect storm of sh*t over the past number of years. To name a few issues, (i) pesky pharmacy benefit managers have pressured the pharmacy chains on pricing, causing increasingly squeezed margins, (ii) massive opioid litigation sparked panic and pause amongst investors, and (iii) new online entrants like </span><strong>Amazon Pharmacy</strong><span> increasingly threaten incumbents and what was historically their most competitive advantage, a convenient neighborhood location. You know what’s more convenient than a convenient neighborhood location? A prescription landing in your mailbox the next day without you having to get off your fat a$$! </span></p><p><span>To counteract these headwinds, Walgreens decided to make a synergistic acquisition. Enter value-based primary care operator, </span><strong>Village Practice Management Company LLC</strong><span> (d/b/a “VillageMD”).</span></p><p>In July ‘20, Walgreens announced a $1b investment in VillageMD for a ~30% equity stake. The thesis was simple: having an in-store primary care clinic attached to a drugstore should drive higher prescription counts. Patients (with a special focus on those with chronic conditions) will go straight from the physician to the pharmacy next door to fill the prescription. This convenience, the thinking went, would drive higher medication adherence rates and, in turn, improve patient outcomes.</p><p>In October ‘21, Walgreens put an additional $5.2b into VillageMD and increased its ownership from 30% to 63%. Curious to see if this strategy worked? Here is the stock performance since the VillageMD acquisition:</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bc535055-ab5c-46ed-a0da-30f308ef3941?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1330,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7c2ff0b-ff94-4d74-b6eb-5529091ac590_665x503.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Google. </figcaption></figure></div><p>That’s right.

Not. Even. A. Little. Bit. A few weeks before the filing, Intrum formed a </span><s>sham</s><span> </span><em>totally legitimate </em><span>subsidiary, </span><strong>Intrum AB of Texas LLC</strong><span> (“Intrum Texas”), for the sole and express purpose of making a U.S. bankruptcy even possible. Outside of cash parked in retainer accounts, the company has absolutely </span><em>zero, zilch, noll</em><span> connections to these United States.** It’s not even clear that Intrum Texas has an actual lease for its purported Houston office. When questioned by </span><strong>Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP’s Ben Finestone</strong><span>, representing an objecting ad hoc group of minority bondholders, the debtors’ CEO </span><strong>Andres Rubio</strong><span> certainly didn’t know:</span></p><pre><code><code>Ben Finestone: [Y]ou don't have any explanation for me, do you, sir, as to how Intrum Texas has its principal place of business at 801 Travis Street if it doesn't own or lease the place, can you?\r\n\r\nAndres Rubio, CEO: I do not.</code></code></pre><p>So, whether these cases should even continue in ‘Murica, rather than, you know, be heard in any one of 22 potential other jurisdictions, was a bit of a hot button issue.</p><p><span>But before we get there, why are the debtors looking to restructure? Per Mr. Rubio, things haven’t exactly been going great over in Sweden. High inflation, high interest rates, a slowing European economy, and of course, our favorite first-day boilerplate, COVID have put pressure on the company and negatively impacted its portfolios. Moreover, in recent years, the company decided to branch out: rather than just servicing the loans of </span><em>others</em><span>, it purchased its own “</span><em>portfolio investments.</em><span>” Ahhh, servicers becoming investors, what could go wrong? Anyone want to guess how that went? Yuuuuup, turns out picking winners and losers is a helluva lot harder than servicing, so in ‘23, the company tucked its tail between its legs, “</span><em>embarked on a shift to a ‘capital-light’ business,</em><span>” and “</span><em>pivot[ed] towards its investment management capabilities</em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>In connection with that “</span><em>strategic direction</em><span>,” Intrum offloaded a bunch of </span><s>that crap</s><span> </span><em>those investments</em><span> to </span><strong>Cerberus</strong><span> in January ‘24 as part of a JV transaction, which the market dumped all over.*** Since then, the company’s suffered more headwinds in the form of credit downgrades (</span><em>“Between January and July of 2024, Moody’s and S&amp;P each downgraded the Company’s corporate family rating four times (Moody’s was downgraded from B1 to Caa2)</em><span>”), low debt trading values (“</span><em>The Company’s unsecured notes traded as low as in the 50-cent range immediately prior to the Company’s restructuring efforts</em><span>”), and a decline in equity value (“</span><em>During the course of 2024, Intrum AB’s equity shares have lost more than 80% of their value”</em><span>).

That resulted in two noteholder groups forming: a “majority ad hoc group” represented by </span><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong><span> </span><strong>LLP</strong><span>****</span><strong> </strong><span>and the minority ad hoc group represented by </span><strong>Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP </strong><span>(</span><strong>Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP</strong><span> has since subbed in).*****</span></p><p><span>After months of “</span><em>extensive, good faith</em><span>” (</span><em>y’all, this phrasing is so, so tired…</em><span>) negotiations, the company entered into a lock-up agreement with the majority ad hoc group — given the group’s name, hopefully this doesn’t come as a surprise to anyone — which was amended in August ‘24 to bring in the company’s revolving lenders.****** As of filing, 97% of the company’s revolving lenders and 73% of its noteholders support the debtors’ restructuring. Under the proposed deal, (i) the revolving facility would be extended by two years in exchange for more fees, higher pricing, and more collateral (🤑) and (ii) the unsecured notes would take a 10% discount to face in exchange for 10% post-dilution equity, a second lien security interest, and, for consenting noteholders, fees, fees, fees. All other claims would be paid in full, the company would receive $573mm in new money from the issuance of new 1.5-lien secured notes, and equity would ride right on through.</span></p><p><span>But unfortunately for Intrum and its cohort of cheerleaders, that level of support wasn’t enough to get this deal done without an 11, so in October ‘24, Intrum Texas — with a certificate of formation that was still warm — did what it was born to do: stepped up and, in a brazen act of fraudulent transfer, obligated itself on Intrum’s debt to give the debtors </span><em>some</em><span> argument for why they wound up in an American bankruptcy court. The debtors also commenced solicitation of their chapter 11 plan, which happens to contain a very convenient injunction (discussed 👇) arguably prohibiting creditors from objecting to any follow-along Swedish proceeding, which everyone agrees is necessary here. You see, Swedish courts aren’t heaps keen on U.S. courts restructuring Swedish companies, so they don’t recognize those U.S. proceedings (and a Swedish proceeding was always in the cards).</span></p><p><span>Three days after filing, and not in love with the prospect of taking a haircut on near-maturity debt, the minority ad hoc group dropped a motion to dismiss (“MTD”) for lack of good faith, taking shots at the company’s lack of financial distress, “</span><em>blatant attempt to manufacture U.S. venue</em><span>,” and the fact that any confirmation order entered by the court means exactly squat as far as Sweden is concerned.</span></p><p>A few weeks later, on December 12, that same group tossed in a confirmation objection, asserting the plan wasn’t filed in good faith, it impermissibly paid original issue discount (OID), and that the injunction noted above non-kosherly impaired creditor due process rights by preventing them from objecting to any future Swedish proceeding, teeing us up for a confirmation battle royale, which took place from December 16 through 19, 2024.</p><p><span>During that contest, the minority ad hoc group made a few pointed observations: (i) over the past year, the company had repeatedly affirmed its solvency, (ii) Mr. Rubio and the company’s chairman (</span><strong>Magnus Lindquist</strong><span>) were dumping several million dollars into Intrum stock purchases as recently as November ‘24, and (iii) the debtors had zero non-ginned up connections to the U.S. Here’s a live clip of Mr. Finestone in court: </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/006ff824-d330-47de-b444-7f83f5b0ad34?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_512,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda82acdf-66f7-4446-92d4-34ad7e304e50_512x275.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY. </figcaption></figure></div><p>You’d think that second point would be some decent evidence that the company wasn’t in too bad of a shape: rational actors don’t usually piss away their moolah, but then again, #YOLO. </p><pre><code><code>Andrew Leblanc, counsel to the debtors: Mr. Lindquist, you were asked … whether you waste your money, I think it was?\r\n\r\nMr. Lindquist: Yes … I don't waste my money, no.\r\n\r\nMr. Leblanc: Mr. Lindquist, you had a successful career over decades in private equity.

Up first, the MTD. While the court quickly noted that the Bankruptcy Code’s definition of “cause” for dismissal isn’t limiting (for the legal scholars out there, it’s an “includes” definition), it gives sixteen-odd examples. The court’s takeaway:</span></p><pre><code><code>“...[W]e do learn something from [those examples]. They all refer to post petition acts, failures to act, or events that occur after an estate is created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Therefore, this quite intentionally non-exhaustive, non-limited definition is very much limited after all, and we can — nay, must — happily ignore all the </span><s>gamesmanship</s><span> strategizing that made a chapter 11 even possible (like forming Intrum Texas in October ‘24, making it a guarantor of Intrum’s debt, moving cash into the United States). To boot, the court found that the company was in good, old-fashioned financial distress, at least enough to support a filing — debts were going to be coming due, dammit, and it’s </span><em>quite </em><span>inconvenient to have to give meaning to a few billion in equity value and the millions poured into stock purchases by management in recent months — best to ignore that. The Bankruptcy Code having been dealt with and inconvenient facts tucked away, the court arrived at good faith and the MTD was toast.</span></p><p><span>With that off the table, confirmation of the plan was a </span><em>fait accompli</em><span>. The court quickly found that it was filed in good faith — technically a different standard than the MTD, but all the same not surprising with the court’s ruling 👆 — and with a few general nods to “OID is a claims resolution issue,” “the plan is a global settlement,” and “the minority ad hoc group is relatively small” to dispose of the OID argument and sidestep fees paid only to consenting noteholders. Turning to the injunction, let’s start with the language:</span></p><pre><code><code>“Upon entry of the [confirmation order], all Persons and Entities shall be enjoined from taking any actions to interfere with the implementation or consummation of this Plan or the vesting of the Estates’ assets in, and the enjoyment of such assets by, the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to this Plan.”</code></code></pre><p>After reading that provision, the court, with a straight face, delivered the following:</p><pre><code><code>“[T]he injunction provisions are I think are customary and appropriate. I don't think they preclude parties from raising issues of Swedish law.”</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/655b6fb2-ac59-4050-bd0d-3d51e7d7fc82?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_336,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F562ab9ac-7cb8-4377-804f-e0450e87f0df_480x480.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Really</em><span>?

Moreover, if the model is working — and in retrospect, we know it has for that 2010 cohort — then I as an investor absolutely would want Box to spend even more on customer acquisition, which, of course, Box has done. The 2011 cohort is bigger than 2010, the 2012 cohort bigger than 2011, etc. This, though, has meant that the aggregate losses have been very large, which looks bad, but, counterintuitively, is a good thing.\n</p>\n<p>Numerous SaaS businesses would include some version of this cohort chart in their S-1’s, each of them manifestations of what I’ve long considered tech’s sixth giant: Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and what I call “Silicon Valley Inc.”, the pipeline of SaaS companies that styled themselves as world-changing startups but which were, in fact, color-by-numbers business model disruptions enabled by cloud computing and a dramatically expanded venture capital ecosystem that increasingly accepted relatively low returns in exchange for massively reduced risk profiles.</p>\n<p>This is not, to be clear, an Article about Box, or any one SaaS company in particular; it is, though, an exploration of how an era that opened — at least in terms of IPOs — a decade ago is both doomed in the long run and yet might have more staying power than you expect.</p>\n<h3>Digital Advertising Differences</h3>\n<p>John Wanamaker, a department store founder and advertising pioneer, famously said, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” That, though, was the late 19th century; the last two decades have seen the rise of digital advertising, the defining characteristic of which is knowledge about whom is being targeted, and whether or not they converted. The specifics of how this works have shifted over time, particularly with the crackdown on cookies and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency initiative, which made digital advertising less deterministic and more probabilistic; the probabilities at play, though, are a lot closer to 100% than they are to a flip-of-a-coin.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is that this advertising approach hasn’t always worked for everything, most notably some of the most advertising-centric businesses in the world. Back in 2016 Procter &amp; Gamble announced they were scaling back targeted Facebook ads; from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-to-scale-back-targeted-facebook-ads-1470760949\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the biggest advertising spender in the world, will move away from ads on Facebook that target specific consumers, concluding that the practice has limited effectiveness. Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&amp;G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners.</p>\n<p>  Marc Pritchard, P&amp;G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?”…On a broader scale, P&amp;G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad.\n</p>\n<p>P&amp;G is a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, and what mattered most for CPG companies was shelf space. Consumers would become aware of a brand through advertising, motivated to buy through things like coupons, and the payoff came when they were in the store and chose one of the CPG brands off the shelf; of course CPG companies paid for that shelf space, particularly coveted end-caps that made it more likely consumers saw the brands they were familiar with through advertising. There were returns to scale, as well: manufacturing is a big one; the more advertising you bought the less paid per ad; more importantly, the more shelf space you had the more room you had to expand your product lines, and crowd out competitors.</p>\n<p>The advertising component specifically was usually outsourced to ad agencies, for reasons I explained in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/ad-agencies-and-accountability/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE3L2FkLWFnZW5jaWVzLWFuZC1hY2NvdW50YWJpbGl0eS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczOTM3Mjc0MywiaWF0IjoxNzM2NzgwNzQzLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.JTdBJDIKDgeRx8BWpREfF2zzkNFfhrzKIXFSiHOV81lWjueRaVVKOvizAUVtpjdicpTIP5e8261T6zqTVpoJHwLP60DRFRWpZj_iatI32Vy1gzbk5Md01qIWgL81ZurEpqPPNbAJqdFHQkGDszF6fHJEMebMTP5QBrnG9-CbMOniw96LJW5KRHZoYWgDuEM_8XIdL3u_KJTQH85DQrY9siM4XFyr0HE84OYk-IhMNYQvBQFYqlpOHiaLnqvvfeNKtAtP5_EeFXQ5tJni7lcl3fSiMVlxwgu-zZ-N-svjhhuWSz1QTPPObA0IvZJhqW35UP1DSll3vKoi5w9SoUPRGw\">a 2017 Article</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  Few advertisers actually buy ads, at least not directly. Way back in 1841, Volney B. Palmer, the first ad agency, was opened in Philadelphia. In place of having to take out ads with multiple newspapers, an advertiser could deal directly with the ad agency, vastly simplifying the process of taking out ads. The ad agency, meanwhile, could leverage its relationships with all of those newspapers by serving multiple clients:</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/ad-agencies-and-accountability/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE3L2FkLWFnZW5jaWVzLWFuZC1hY2NvdW50YWJpbGl0eS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczOTM3Mjc0MywiaWF0IjoxNzM2NzgwNzQzLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.JTdBJDIKDgeRx8BWpREfF2zzkNFfhrzKIXFSiHOV81lWjueRaVVKOvizAUVtpjdicpTIP5e8261T6zqTVpoJHwLP60DRFRWpZj_iatI32Vy1gzbk5Md01qIWgL81ZurEpqPPNbAJqdFHQkGDszF6fHJEMebMTP5QBrnG9-CbMOniw96LJW5KRHZoYWgDuEM_8XIdL3u_KJTQH85DQrY9siM4XFyr0HE84OYk-IhMNYQvBQFYqlpOHiaLnqvvfeNKtAtP5_EeFXQ5tJni7lcl3fSiMVlxwgu-zZ-N-svjhhuWSz1QTPPObA0IvZJhqW35UP1DSll3vKoi5w9SoUPRGw\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_0142.jpg?resize=1024%2C642&amp;ssl=1\"></a></p>\n<p>  It’s a classic example of how being in the middle can be a really great business opportunity, and the utility of ad agencies only increased as more advertising formats like radio and TV became available. Particularly in the case of TV, advertisers not only needed to place ads, but also needed a lot more help in making ads; ad agencies invested in ad-making expertise because they could scale said expertise across multiple clients.</p>\n<p>  At the same time, the advertisers were rapidly expanding their geographic footprints, particularly after the Second World War; naturally, ad agencies increased their footprint at the same time, often through M&amp;A. The overarching business opportunity, though, was the same: give advertisers a one-stop shop for all of their advertising needs.\n</p>\n<p>The Internet provided two big challenges to this approach. First, the primary conversion point changed from the cash register to the check-out page; the products that benefited the most were either purely digital (like apps) or — at least in the earlier days of e-commerce — spur-of-the-moment purchases without major time pressure. CPG products didn’t really fall in either bucket.</p>\n<p>Second, these types of purchases aligned well with the organizing principle of digital advertising, which is the individual consumer. What Facebook — now Meta — is better at than anyone in the world is understanding consumers not as members of a cohort or demographic group but rather as individuals, and serving them ads that are uniquely interesting to them.</p>\n<p>Notice, though, that nothing in the traditional advertiser model was concerned with the individual: brands are created for cohorts or demographic groups, because they need to be manufactured at scale; then, ad agencies would advertise at scale — making money along the way — and the purchase would be consummated in physical stores at some later point in time, constrained (and propelled by) limited shelf space. Thus P&amp;G’s pullback — and thus the opportunity for an entirely new wave of companies that were built around digital advertising and its deep personalization from the get-go.</p>\n<p>This bifurcation manifested itself most starkly in the summer of 2020, when large advertisers boycotted Facebook over the company’s refusal to censor then-President Trump; Facebook was barely affected.

Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.</p>\n<p>  In this way Facebook has a degree of anti-fragility that even Google lacks: so much of its business comes from the long tail of Internet-native companies that are built around Facebook from first principles, that any disruption to traditional advertisers — like the coronavirus crisis or the current boycotts — actually serves to strengthen the Facebook ecosystem at the expense of the TV-centric ecosystem of which these CPG companies are a part.\n</p>\n<p>It has been nine years since that P&amp;G pullback I referenced above, and one of the big changes that P&amp;G has made in that timeframe is to <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/how-procter-gambles-media-strategy-changes-role-agencies/2473956\">take most of their ad-buying in-house</a>. This was in the long run inevitable, as the Internet ate everything, including traditional TV viewing, and as the rise of Aggregation platforms meant that the number of places you needed to actually buy an ad to reach everyone decreased even as potential reach increased. Those platforms also got better: programmatic platforms achieve P&amp;G’s goal of mass reach in a way that actually increased efficiency instead of over-spending to over-target; programmatic advertising also covers more platforms now, including TV.</p>\n<h3>o3 Ammunition</h3>\n<p>Late last month OpenAI announced its <code>o3</code> model, validating its initial <code>o1</code> release and the returns that come from test-time scaling; I explained <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/openais-new-model-how-o1-works-scaling-inference/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L29wZW5haXMtbmV3LW1vZGVsLWhvdy1vMS13b3Jrcy1zY2FsaW5nLWluZmVyZW5jZS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczOTM3Mjc0MywiaWF0IjoxNzM2NzgwNzQzLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.fnsFltkkg0SJHnw0Mr_H9qXU7Iqn8-iOQzbMxybn6QoYP4cg_gPAAI9M59VjBHwzgK8-MXL6CxNkwUB4gwEGXHZu8yttAPPjiBhbdPN8BhvbIYWmyC1f-_IMAIGfozQpZbY6HaRbzVa1EXelK4TPbmdwSyTAR_IrN6t9t9bLl0plxG-z8gZuMvuAWI_RFNKDo4vray74qskEvKub2GBeOxpRqfHxGVo7Y3Hezdpppp_JnK42UYJ0hYRWaGu5Cow86iY3jKfuuIH17IiIIYgxAoASG4tAyDIx5fQnKeVWFVTvXkDlHMDcFqOJ9Tft9-LOalFXBRr1q3tVuUrz4IAS8g\">in an Update</a> when <code>o1</code> was released:</p>\n<p>\n  There has been a lot of talk about the importance of scale in terms of LLM performance; for auto-regressive LLMs that has meant training scale. The more parameters you have, the larger the infrastructure you need, but the payoff is greater accuracy because the model is incorporating that much more information. That certainly still applies to <code>o1</code>, as the chart on the left indicates.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/o1-2.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1\"></a></p>\n<p>  It’s the chart on the right that is the bigger deal: <code>o1</code> gets more accurate the more time it spends on compute at inference time. This makes sense intuitively given what I laid out above: the more time spent on compute the more time <code>o1</code> can spend spinning up multiple chains-of-thought, checking its answers, and iterating through different approaches and solutions.</p>\n<p>  It’s also a big departure from how we have thought about LLMs to date: one of the “benefits” of auto-regressive LLMs is that you’re only generating one answer in a serial manner. Yes, you can get that answer faster with beefier hardware, but that is another way of saying that the pay-off from more inference compute is getting the answer faster; the accuracy of the answer is a function of the underlying model, not the amount of compute brought to bear. Another way to think about it is that the more important question for inference is how much memory is available; the more memory there is, the larger the model, and therefore, the greater amount of accuracy.</p>\n<p>  In this <code>o1</code> represents a new inference paradigm: yes, you need memory to load the model, but given the same model, answer quality does improve with more compute. The way that I am thinking about it is that more compute is kind of like having more branch predictors, which mean more registers, which require more cache, etc.; this isn’t a perfect analogy, but it is interesting to think about inference compute as being a sort of dynamic memory architecture for LLMs that lets them explore latent space for the best answer.\n</p>\n<p><code>o3</code> significantly outperforms <code>o1</code>, and the extent of that outperformance is dictated by how much computing is allocated to the problem at hand. One of the most stark examples was <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\"><code>o3</code>‘s performance on the ARC prize</a>, a visual puzzle test that is designed to be easy for humans but hard for LLMs:</p>\n<p>\n  OpenAI’s new o3 system – trained on the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set – has scored a breakthrough 75.7% on the Semi-Private Evaluation set at our stated public leaderboard $10k compute limit. A high-compute (172x) o3 configuration scored 87.5%.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ai-uneven-arrival-1.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1\"></a></p>\n<p>  This is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models. For context, ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o. All intuition about AI capabilities will need to get updated for o3…</p>\n<p>  Despite the significant cost per task, these numbers aren’t just the result of applying brute force compute to the benchmark. OpenAI’s new o3 model represents a significant leap forward in AI’s ability to adapt to novel tasks. This is not merely incremental improvement, but a genuine breakthrough, marking a qualitative shift in AI capabilities compared to the prior limitations of LLMs. o3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never encountered before, arguably approaching human-level performance in the ARC-AGI domain.</p>\n<p>  Of course, such generality comes at a steep cost, and wouldn’t quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly $5 per task (we know, we did that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires $17-20 per task in the low-compute mode. But cost-performance will likely improve quite dramatically over the next few months and years, so you should plan for these capabilities to become competitive with human work within a fairly short timeline.\n</p>\n<p>I don’t believe that <code>o3</code> and inference-time scaling will displace traditional LLMs, which will remain both faster and cheaper; indeed, they will likely make traditional LLMs better through their ability to generate synthetic data for further scaling of pre-training. There remains a large product overhang for traditional LLMS — the technology is far more capable than the products that have been developed to date — but even the current dominant product, chatbots, are better experienced with a traditional LLM.</p>\n<p>That very use case, however, gets at traditional LLM limitations: because they lack the ability to think and decide and verify they are best thought of as a tool for humans to leverage. Indeed, while conventional wisdom about these models is that it allows anyone to generate good enough writing and research, the biggest returns come to those with the most expertise and agency, who are able to use their own knowledge and judgment to reap efficiency gains while managing hallucinations and mistakes.</p>\n<p>What <code>o3</code> and inference-time scaling point to is something different: AI’s that can actually be given tasks and trusted to complete them. This, by extension, looks a lot more like an independent worker than an assistant — ammunition, rather than a rifle sight. That may seem an odd analogy, but it comes from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs\">a talk Keith Rabois gave at Stanford</a>:</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/Xxwv3tcK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata\"><img src=\"https://assets.stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-Xxwv3tcK.png\"></a></div>\n<p>\n  So I like this idea of barrels and ammunition. Most companies, once they get into hiring mode…just hire a lot of people, you expect that when you add more people your horsepower or your velocity of shipping things is going to increase. Turns out it doesn’t work that way. When you hire more engineers you don’t get that much more done. You actually sometimes get less done. You hire more designers, you definitely don’t get more done, you get less done in a day.</p>\n<p>  The reason why is because most great people actually are ammunition. But what you need in your company are barrels. And you can only shoot through the number of unique barrels that you have. That’s how the velocity of your company improves is adding barrels. Then you stock them with ammunition, then you can do a lot. You go from one barrel company, which is mostly how you start, to a two barrel company, suddenly you get twice as many things done in a day, per week, per quarter. If you go to three barrels, great. If you go to four barrels, awesome. Barrels are very difficult to find. But when you have them, give them lots of equity. Promote them, take them to dinner every week, because they are virtually irreplaceable. They are also very culturally specific. So a barrel at one company may not be a barrel at another company because one of the ways, the definition of a barrel is, they can take an idea from conception and take it all the way to shipping and bring people with them. And that’s a very cultural skill set.\n</p>\n<p>The promise of AI generally, and inference-time scaling models in particular, is that they can be ammunition; in this context, the costs — even marginal ones — will in the long run be immaterial compared to the costs of people, particularly once you factor in non-salary costs like coordination and motivation.</p>\n<h3>The Uneven AI Arrival</h3>\n<p>There is a long way to go to realize this vision technically, although the arrival of first <code>o1</code> and then <code>o3</code> signal that the future is arriving more quickly than most people realize. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections\">wrote on his blog</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.\n</p>\n<p>I grant the technical optimism; my definition of AGI is that it can be ammunition, i.e. it can be given a task and trusted to complete it at a good-enough rate (my definition of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is the ability to come up with the tasks in the first place). The reason for the extended digression on advertising, however, is to explain why I’m skeptical about AI “materially chang[ing] the output of companies”, at least in 2025.</p>\n<p>In this analogy CPG companies stand in for the corporate world generally. What will become clear once AI ammunition becomes available is just how unsuited most companies are for high precision agents, just as P&amp;G was unsuited for highly-targeted advertising. No matter how well-documented a company’s processes might be, it will became clear that there are massive gaps that were filled through experience and tacit knowledge by the human ammunition.</p>\n<p>SaaS companies, meanwhile, are the ad agencies. The ad agencies had value by providing a means for advertisers to scale to all sorts of media across geographies; SaaS companies have value by giving human ammunition software to do their job. Ad agencies, meanwhile, made money by charging a commission on the advertising they bought; SaaS companies make money by charging a per-seat licensing fee. Look again at that S-1 excerpt I opened with:</p>\n<p>\n  Our business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time…\n</p>\n<p>The positive return on investment comes from retaining and increasing seat licenses; those seats, however, are proxies for actually getting work done, just as advertising was just a proxy for actually selling something. Part of what made direct response digital advertising fundamentally different is that it was tied to actually making a sale, as opposed to lifting brand awareness, which is a proxy for the ultimate goal of increasing revenue. To that end, AI — particularly AI’s like <code>o3</code> that scale with compute — will be priced according to the value of the task they complete; the amount that companies will pay for inference time compute will be a function of how much the task is worth. This is analogous to digital ads that are priced by conversion, not CPM.</p>\n<p>The companies that actually leveraged that capability, however, were not, at least for a good long while, the companies that dominated the old advertising paradigm. Facebook became a juggernaut by creating its own customer base, not by being the advertising platform of choice for companies like P&amp;G; meanwhile, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE2L3R2LWFkdmVydGlzaW5ncy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLXN0cmVuZ3RoLWFuZC1pbmV2aXRhYmxlLWZhbGwvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3MzkzNzI3NDMsImlhdCI6MTczNjc4MDc0MywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.LOg80aKaji_RVMSMC9Dlod8Az0SPCZO0n1DPEwQ-H-XZ_1XrXyjYCcelLJbJROPVuxpiFVgz2GxgDLnUpfqvdR_AZKRoeSFCOqqjock9thCztKoKsiyCcZAERxtMN7E5Z1rg43yD2s9WLwLnHp4ZUdvj_MrdO4m8zr2hx26qOnbClhxR97SGy9piixAQk2MrfpKWpqz_AFhUzasGUxgXt2Nx3M52oJ51yiX1yULFM2YPtZCt0_Q7i2suCR0NSd9iyGVklQi-2x--6SH2k4-hBARME0nApUB5hUArvF4baAk31A5VIT8FVkOXABJqYbWNezvPmhntIQsQlmyf2NAo6w\">TV and the economy built on it stayed relevant far longer than anyone expected</a>. And, by the time TV truly collapsed, both the old guard and digital advertising had evolved to the point that they could work together.</p>\n<p>If something similar plays out with AI agents, then the most important AI customers will primarily be new companies, and probably a lot of them will be long tail type entities that take the barrel and ammunition analogy to its logical extreme.

C-peptide levels also increase with a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), consistent with insulin secretion in response to a meal.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sana Biotechnology’s first-in-human study demonstrated that their hypoimmune (HIP) technology enables pancreatic islet cell transplantation in type 1 diabetes patients without the need for immunosuppression. This is a big deal because transplanted cells do not normally survive the body’s immune response, without immunosuppression.</p><p>In Type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys cells that produce insulin (called beta cells). Currently, if you transplant new insulin-producing cells from a donor, patients need to take powerful drugs to suppress their immune system to prevent rejection. That’s clearly not ideal.</p><p>Sana has developed a way to modify donor insulin-producing cells (called HIP technology) so they can \"hide\" from the immune system.</p><p>The transplanted cells produced insulin, as evidenced by C-peptide levels, and avoided immune rejection, meaning the transplanted cells successfully functioned like natural insulin-producing beta cells. Further more, the cells properly transplanted without the need for potentially harmful immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>This kind of cell transplant could completely change how we treat type 1 diabetes by offering a long-term solution without daily insulin shots or risky immune-suppressing drugs. Additionally, it shows that we might be able to transplant cells or organs without the body attacking them, which could transform how we treat all kinds of diseases.</p><p><span>Robert Nelsen, through whose </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/93acd32e-dac2-42c7-ba2b-f6df64c1a8e7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">tweet</a><span> we heard about the result, summed up the potential poignantly: “In my 40 years of biotech, I was waiting to see this result. </span><strong>Never before have transplanted cells survived normal immune response without immunosuppression.</strong><span> Excited for patients, many whom I know see hope today for a possible cure for many diseases.”</span></p><p><span>On Halloween 2023, Elliot called cell-based therapies </span><span>With results like this, it’s easy to see how that may be the case. </span></p><p><em><span>From Eric W.

When they exposed non-neural cells (including kidney cells) to repeated chemical signals, the cells showed \"memory-like\" responses eerily similar to how neurons behave during learning - responding better to spaced-out stimuli than cramming, just like we do when studying. </p><p>Lead researcher Nikolay Kukushkin suggests we might one day be able to \"train\" cells to perform beneficial behaviors, like teaching muscle cells to produce healthy hormones or programming cancer cells to stop dividing. </p><p>\"To the cells of our body, anything that we do regularly — eating, exercising, taking medicine — is a pattern of chemicals in time,\" explains Kukushkin. </p><p>The discovery suggests memory isn't just a brain thing, but rather a fundamental feature of cellular biology that evolution figured out long before nervous systems existed. </p><p>While there are some differences, this work parallels the mind-bending work Dr. Michael Levin is doing on bioelectricity at Tufts, with both challenging the traditional neurocentric view of information processing. Both show that non-neural cells can process and store information. Both suggest \"intelligence-like\" behaviors exist at the cellular level. Both point to potential therapeutic applications by manipulating cellular behavior. Both challenge the idea that information processing is unique to the brain. </p><p>If Levin is showing how groups of cells can make decisions and maintain patterns, this work is showing how individual cells can \"learn\" from repeated experiences - different scales of the same fascinating phenomenon of non-neural intelligence.</p><p><span>For more on Levin’s work, check out this </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/68123955-f404-4f5e-95a8-6052f30beb90?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">excellent recent interview</a><span>. </span></p><p><em>From Prime Intellect</em></p><blockquote><p><em>We are releasing a 7B parameter metagenomic foundation model designed for pandemic monitoring, trained on over 1.5T base pairs of DNA and RNA sequenced from wastewater.</em></p></blockquote><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3bc97d83-b823-4119-9e97-cd10fb803699?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/ZAGbEKLLAew\"></a><p>You think AI is going to kill us?</p><p>Au contraire, mon frère!</p><p>It could save us from the next pandemic or large scale bioattack.</p><p><span>A research team from USC, Prime Intellect, and Nucleic Acid Observatory released </span><strong>METAGENE-1</strong><span>, a groundbreaking 7-billion-parameter AI model trained on 1.5 trillion DNA and RNA base pairs from human wastewater to improve pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection.

It’s the largest known lithium deposit in the world and it sits right here on U.S. of A soil.

What’s changed is that we’re actually getting moving on this thing. </span></p><p>The Thacker Pass project, located within the caldera, is aiming to produce 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually starting in 2026. The Department of Energy and General Motors are supporting the $2 billion project.</p><p><span>For context, according to a </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/a571061a-ef7a-47ec-8ac5-daa3004421a5?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Popular Mechanics</a></em><span> report, the world will need 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes of lithium by 2030, but “In 2021, the world produced only 105—not 105,000—tonnes.” </span><em> </em><span> </span></p><p>The project is divinely times, with lithium demand soaring to meet the clean energy transition and our relationship with foreign lithium providers on increasingly shaky ground.

He’ll bring some bold leadership and entertainment chops with him, and certainly a relatively heavy dose of anti-woke perspectives.</p><p>Zuck followed up this appointment with with a seemingly related update on Meta’s content moderation policies. In short, Meta has decided to disband its fact-checking program, opting instead of an style Community Notes model, and are further lifting the restrictions on free speech. We think this is a good thing!</p><p>The Meta content moderation situation was a story of death by a thousand cuts. No one individual content moderation decision was particularly offensive in my view — and certainly each decision could be viewed as reasonable — but these decisions mounted over time to the point that Meta was restricting free speech (which as a private company, is well within their rights). I think many of us are kind of guilty of this over the last decade — make seemingly inclusive, safe, and politically correct decisions, that in a vacuum seem reasonable, but in aggregate warp our view of right and wrong, true and false, reality and fantasy. Many of us personally came to this realization over the last couple of years, and now Meta is as well.</p><p>Ultimately, this is a pro free speech move and that’s net-net a good thing. Free speech isn’t always pleasant, it doesn’t always make for the most squeaky clean social media network, and it will certainly cause some controversy. But ultimately free speech is the driver of societal progress: it’s how we challenge bad ideas, share truths, and foster understanding.</p><p>Pretty brave move by Zuck and the boys!</p><p>Packy again.

Puff Daddy &amp; Mase) - 2014 Remaster</p><p>The Notorious B.I.G., Mase, Diddy</p><p><span>The debtors, like most of the others we reviewed in ‘24, suffered from increases galore. Like, ⬆️ operating and labor expense, ⬆️ insurance expense, and ⬆️ interest expense. The debtors also struggled to either make money off of existing contracts or maintain contracts and the wheels basically came off in ‘23.</span><span>⁷</span><span> These were not favorable trends going into a debt maturity — specifically, an October ‘24 debt maturity on the debtors’ pre-petition RCF. Basically this situation was a perfect storm of 💩. </span></p><p><span>And so the debtors — with an army of restructuring professionals in tow — spent the entirety of ‘24 trying to source an out-of-court solution to address their growing liquidity problem and RCF maturity problem; they brought on </span><strong>Lazard Freres &amp; Co. LLC ($LAZ)</strong><span>(Christian Tempke) and healthcare banking specialist </span><strong>MTS Health Partners</strong><span> (“MTS”)(Jason Schoenholtz) to conduct a marketing process of their behavioral health division, “Recovery Solutions,” with the hope that the proceeds could pay down the RCF and better situate the debtors for an extension of other debt. </span></p><p>That. Clearly. Did. Not. Happen. </p><p><span>And so the debtors found their way into chapter 11 bankruptcy, with a restructuring support agreement (“RSA”) (i) agreed to by the debtors and an ad hoc group of lenders composed of eleven funds: </span><strong>Arena Capital Advisors LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Bardin Hill Investment Partners LP</strong><span>, </span><strong>FS Investment Solutions LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Lord Abbett &amp; Co. LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Palmer Square Capital Management LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>Prospect Capital Management LP</strong><span>, </span><strong>Ripple Industries LLC</strong><span>, </span><strong>UBS AG, Värde Partners Inc.</strong><span>, </span><strong>WhiteStar Asset Management LLC</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Trinitas Capital Management LLC</strong><span> (the “ad hoc group”), and (ii) backed by about 85% of the debtors’ first lien lenders and over 80% of their second lien lenders.</span></p><p>Despite some bumps along the way, the debtors’ cases have progressed remarkably smoothly so far, in large part due to the apparent constructive approach taken by the debtors, the ad hoc group, and their professionals. Here are the highlights of the relief the debtors requested and subsequent developments:</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>DIP Facility</strong><span>. As contemplated by the RSA, the debtors sought approval of a $522,375,000 DIP facility composed of (i) a $105mm syndicated-to-all-lenders-postpetition-but-backstopped-by-the-ad-hoc-group new money component and (ii) a $417,375,000 prepetition secured loan roll-up (a 3.975:1 ratio).

During that interim period, the UST appointed a 10-member official committee of unsecured creditors (the “UCC”),</span><span>⁸</span><span> and rather than have a contested DIP hearing, the lenders agreed (and no one else objected) to a final roll-up of 2.45:1, bringing it down to a total of $257,250,000 — over $160mm less!</span></p><p>The final DIP order also limited the DIP lenders’ credit bid right to the Recovery Solutions division of the debtors’ business (subject to a cap to be agreed among the lenders, the debtors, and the UCC, in a last ditch effort to drum up a competing bid), leaving cold hard 💸💸💸 as the only option for a Local Government or State &amp; Federal business bid and, following the closing of the sale of the Recovery Solutions business, the DIP will be deemed satisfied in full (after which the prepetition lenders step in as the relevant consenting parties with respect to cash collateral usage). Honestly, what a compromise by the lenders!</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Bid Procedures Motion</strong><span>. Shortly after their cases filed and to comply with the RSA’s timeline, the debtors teed up an emergency motion for approval of (i) fast-track sale procedures for the Recovery Solutions business (culminating in a sale hearing a mere six weeks after filing) and (ii) a slightly elongated sale process for their Local Government and State &amp; Federal divisions (with sale hearings to happen around February 4, 2025).</span></p><p><span>As suggested above, the DIP lenders are serving as a stalking horse for the Recovery Solutions business. As for the other two divisions, the lenders propose to purchase new equity interests in reorganized Wellpath via a direct private placement pursuant to a plan, subject, of course, to the aforementioned bid procedures and a 363 sale process and with respect to which the UCC reserved all rights.</span><span>⁹</span></p><p><span>Notwithstanding the debtors’ aggressive timeline, the UST didn’t object, and the court quickly approved the motion on November 18, 2024. But shortly after being formed, the UCC petitioned the court to pump the brakes on the Recovery Solutions sale — as always, more time was needed and, after all, it’s the holidays, 🙄. But after some conversations among the parties, all was well once again — the court entered a new, consensual bidding procedures order kicking out the Recovery Solutions dates by about a week, subject to certain automatic extensions, which have since occurred.</span><span>¹⁰</span><span> Bids for the Recovery Solutions business were due on January 6, 2025, and … well … this 👇. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/99a506c3-e859-42ba-899c-a5e3536001f0?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1302,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05ec11b-17cf-425e-a41e-d86fcc736980_651x374.png\"></a><figcaption>Source: Docket 817.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A hearing is scheduled to take place later today, January 8, 2025, wherein the debtors will seek approval of the sale. </p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Bar Date Motion</strong><span>. As most of our readers know, bar date motions are pretty routine and typically don’t get a lot of attention. That wasn’t the case here: given the unique situation in which many of the debtors’ creditors find themselves (you know, behind bars), the bar date motion received some unexpected commentary, namely, from the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Human Rights Defense Center, Public Justice, and Rights Behind Bars, who bandied together and filed an amicus brief. That brief noted what might be considered obvious on reflection: (i) mail service in prisons and jails sucks and requiring the incarcerated, who don’t have regular postal service access or any internet access, to return proofs of claim within 30 days was a bit much and (ii) documents full of legalese can be difficult to understand even for those out there who spent 3 years in law school. </span></p><p>To their credit though, the debtors and the UCC bent over backwards to address their concerns and revised the materials to generally make it easier for those individuals to understand what they need to do and get their claims on file, including by (i) kicking out the deadline to file from 30 to 100 days post-service, (ii) allowing claims to be filed English or Spanish, and (iii) streamlining the process by which relevant debtors are identified.</p><p><span>📍</span><strong>Stay Extension and Relief Motions</strong><span>. Oh boy, are these both messy and fun. Because Wellpath contracts with government entities and provides health services to individuals in — we’ll say — less than ideal environments, they and many of the folks they’ve ever been associated with, including their equity sponsor H.I.G., their D&amp;Os, and doctors, have been on the receiving end of a variety of claims and lawsuits, including “1983 claims.” For those that don’t dabble in that area of the law, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lets individuals sue for violations of their constitutional rights, such as, for example, denying them necessary medical services while incarcerated. What kind of violations have (allegedly) occurred? About as bad as you can imagine. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/54b41d3e-20b5-4d89-bce0-aa3cc060e7e5?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">Here</a><span>’s what one court found in a prepetition lawsuit:</span></p><pre><code><code>“[T]here was an avalanche of evidence presented to the jury that [one debtor’s] deliberate indifference [in addressing a patient’s medical needs] caused the constitutional violations inflicted on [her], resulting in her pain, suffering, and death.”</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/ea912f2f-b9a8-4e47-943f-173645d7c25d?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122a7fd7-101d-4cff-972a-3ef43ffa000c_480x269.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But because the lawsuits involve non-debtors and could result in debtor indemnity obligations, the erosion of insurance policies, and the like, the debtors endeavored to “extend” the automatic stay to certain of their non-debtor affiliates and equity sponsor during their chapter 11 cases.</span><span>¹¹</span></p><p><span>The court approved the relief on an interim basis without much fanfare, but understandably, not everyone is on board with this approach: the docket is </span><em>littered</em><span> with letters to the court (some, handwritten), objections, and even some motions to lift the automatic stay for lawsuits to proceed.

With these new developments, however, the long time CEO of Rennova, </span><strong>Seamus Lagan</strong><span>, has now found himself as the new CEO of FOXO.</span><span>¹³</span><span> Further, in ‘20 Mr. Lagan held ~40% of Rennova’s common stock.</span></p><p>Meaning … FOXO is now, effectively, beholden to its new CEO who weaseled his operating businesses into a NYSE listed failing epigenetics company.</p><p>And look this is fun, we could spend hours diving into the new documents, but we think this sums up the transactions best, from the 3Q’24 10Q:</p><pre><code><code>“The Company can provide no assurance that these actions will be successful or that additional sources of financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. As such, until additional equity or debt capital is secured and the Company begins generating sufficient revenue and operating cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result of the Company’s acquisition of RCHI on September 10, 2024, the Company believes it will be able to fund its operations until the second quarter of 2025. In any event, if the Company is unable to fund its operations, it will be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include further curtailing or suspending its operations, selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to take any of these actions could occur at a time that is earlier than when the Company would otherwise exhaust its cash resources.”</code></code></pre><p>Indeed, 3Q’24 was the first quarter that reflected the acquisitions and the company posted operating losses of $1mm and a CFO of negative $1.5mm. There’s currently $34k of cash on the balance sheet.</p><h3><strong>📚Resources📚</strong></h3><p><span>We have compiled a list of a$$-kicking resources on the topics of restructuring, tech, finance, investing, and disruption. 💥</span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fbb34789-ab6d-445f-8060-26983a6af877?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">You can find it here</a></strong><span>💥. </span></p><h3><strong>📤 Notice📤</strong></h3><p><strong>Don Harer</strong><span> (Partner) joined </span><strong>Paladin Management</strong><span> from FTI Consulting Inc. </span></p><p><strong>Robin Spigel</strong><span> (Partner) joined </span><strong>Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP</strong><span> from A&amp;O Shearman. </span></p><h3>🍾Congratulations to…🍾</h3><p><strong>Agustina Berro</strong><span> on her promotion to Partner at </span><strong>Glenn Agre Bergman &amp; Fuentes LLP</strong><span>. </span></p><p><strong>Colleen Restel</strong><span> on her promotion to Partner at </span><strong>Lowenstein Sandler LLP</strong><span>. </span></p><p><strong>Zachary Lanier</strong><span> on his promotion to Partner at </span><strong>Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>Turnarounds &amp; Workouts Outstanding Restructuring Lawyers of 2024 including: </span><strong>Gregg Galardi</strong><span> </span><strong>(Ropes &amp; Gray LLP), Timothy Graulich (Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Scott Greenberg (Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>David Hillman (Proskauer Rose LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Darren Klein (Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Paul Leake (Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Lorenzo Marinuzzi (Morrison Foerster LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Brett Miller (Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Curtis Miller (Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp; Tunnell LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Gabriel Morgan (Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Joel Moss (Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Sandeep Qusba (Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Adam Rogoff (Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel LLP)</strong><span>, </span><strong>Steven Serajeddini (Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP)</strong><span>, and </span><strong>John Sobolewski (Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz)</strong><span>.</span></p><div><span>1</span><div><p><span>There’ll be more ‘24 “trash” to address on Sunday too, don’t worry.

The Freedom Group subsequently appealed the order, so it’s not clear what, if anything, was accomplished? The Freedom Group also (i) objected to the debtors’ motion to kick out the deadline to file SOFAs and schedules, which was resolved consensually by punting the DS hearing from December 17, 2024 to January 15, 2024, and (ii) filed a motion to adjourn the second day hearing, which was scheduled for December 10 (coincidentally, the same day as the second day hearing, which went forward, lol).</p></div></div><div><span>3</span><div><p><span>As if all of that wasn’t enough, a trust established for the victims of alleged fraud relating to the collapse of </span><strong>Prophecy Asset Management LP</strong><span> also objected to the debtors’ retention of </span><strong>Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP</strong><span> because of “</span><em>Willkie’s pre-petition relationship with and representation of the Debtors, [Brian] Kahn (the founder and former director and officer of certain of the Debtors) and his affiliated entities, and other parties [including B. Riley Financial] related to fundamental transactions preceding (and possibly causing) the financial collapse of the Debtors and the filing of [their] Chapter 11 Cases.</em><span>” For a point of comparison, work for Kahn and his affiliates represented about 0.27% of Willkie’s revenue in ‘23, while </span><strong>Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP</strong><span> got bounced from the </span><strong>Enviva</strong><span> cases because Enviva’s 43% equity owner, </span><strong>Riverstone</strong><span>, represented 0.8% of V&amp;E’s billings and 1.4% of V&amp;E’s collections for ‘23. A hearing on the retention is scheduled for January 15, 2025, so stay tuned — could history repeat itself?!</span></p></div></div><div><span>4</span><div><p>Jabbing a couple thumbs in the Freedom Group’s eyes, on January 3, 2025, the debtors revised their proposed plan and disclosure statement to adjust the strike price of the 2L’s plan recovery (warrants in the reorganized debtors) upwards by all costs and expenses incurred relating to the Freedom Group’s onslaught of litigation, as well as any delay of confirmation they cause — which, we’d be remiss not to acknowledge, is f*cking hilarious. </p></div></div><div><span>5</span><div><p><span>The UCC consists of </span><strong>Nestle</strong><span>, </span><strong>Solstice Sleep Company</strong><span>, </span><strong>Federal Warranty Service Corporation</strong><span>, </span><strong>NNN REIT, LP (f/k/a National Retail Properties)</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Jennifer Walker</strong><span>, individually and in her capacity as a putative class representative; it is represented by </span><strong>Pachulski Stang Ziehl &amp; Jones LLP </strong><span>(Brad Sandler, Colin Robinson, Robert Feinstein, Alan Kornfeld, Theodore Heckel) as legal counsel, </span><strong>Province LLC</strong><span> (Sanjuro Kietlinski) as financial advisor, and </span><strong>Perella Weinberg Partners LP ($PWP) </strong><span>(Bruce Mendelsohn) as proposed investment banker.</span></p></div></div><div><span>6</span><div><p>In terms of size, the debtors’ “Local Government” division was the most lucrative in ‘23, followed by their “State &amp; Federal” division and their “Recovery Solutions” division. All three, however, suffered revenue setbacks in ‘24.</p></div></div><div><span>7</span><div><p>It seems the debtors’ State &amp; Federal division lost three contracts in ‘24 that accounted for over $440mm of annual revenue, 😬.</p></div></div><div><span>8</span><div><p>The UCC is composed of (i) Scott Allen for the estate of Brady Allen, (ii) Correct Rx Pharmacy Services, Inc., (iii) Ryan Curtis, (iv) Diamond Drugs, Inc., (v) Angela Hoyle, (vi) Elizabeth Naranjo for Estate of Cristo Canett, (vii) Teesha Ontiveros for the estate of Frankie Jacquez, (viii) Select Medical Corporation, (ix) Wellstar MCG Health, and (x) David Ryan Rood – that’s quite a bit of inmate representation!</p></div></div><div><span>9</span><div><p>This outcome is embodied in a plan filed by the debtors in late December ‘24 (Docket 564). In many respects, it’s a placeholder while the sale process plays out and does not include information on projected recoveries or the specific assets to be distributed to unsecured creditors. A hearing to consider approval of the corresponding disclosure statement (Docket 566) is scheduled for January 28, 2025, so expect to see revisions in the coming weeks.</p></div></div><div><span>10</span><div><p>When and how these extensions are triggered is damn murky. The bidding procedures tie the extensions to updates on a fugly website maintained by COMMBUYS (Massachusetts’ official procurement record system), even though the debtors have operations in 38 other states. Luckily, the debtors filed a notice clearing up our confusion.</p></div></div><div><span>11</span><div><p>As the UST pointed out at the first day hearing, this relief is not so much an “extension” as a new injunction, which requires an adversary proceeding. The judge declined to rule on that issue until the final hearing.</p></div></div><div><span>12</span><div><p><span>It’s not clear why the UCC needs two financial advisors, although each swears up and down it won’t duplicate any efforts by the other. Notably, Dundon’s retention application includes services that appear legal in nature (e.g. “</span><em>Analysis of … attachment and perfection of liens,</em><span>” “</span><em>Analysis of … bar date orders, claims solicitation and receipt procedures and their implementation</em><span>”).</span></p></div></div><div><span>13</span><div><p><span>While serving as CEO of Rennova, a firm called Alcimede Limited was charging $100k per quarter for “consulting services.” Guess who is the sole manager of Alcimede? That’s right, it’s Mr. Lagan himself.

It forces me to confront what unites my work. Why these pieces and not those? How is this all one thing? </p><p><span>You might say it doesn’t have to be; we are multifaceted, etc. But I have noticed that my favorite creative people—whether it’s Rebecca Solnit or Ada Limón, Ta-Nehisi Coates or Miranda July, Mimi Tempestt or Richard Powers, Jenny Odell or Valerie June, Ross Gay or George Saunders—are engaged in </span><em>a life project</em><span>, each work a piece of some whole. Their books or poems or Instagram posts gather force from this larger system of thought, action, and intensity. And in any case: doesn’t it seem useful to search out the guidewires and mycorrhizal networks underlying your creative life?</span></p><p>My own production has been all over the place. Tech criticism, observational plant writing, logistics, renewable energy, lots of history, data work. Some of the diffusion is the fields I’ve worked in, which emphasize speed and relevance to the moment. But it’s also me. I am tirelessly associative, relentlessly driven to swoop up to larger scales and zoom in to smaller ones. I compulsively jump to adjacent fields and distant research. I’m interested in a huge variety of things and can at least passably understand most of them. </p><p><span>Only yesterday did I finally realize: wait, this isn’t a defect, but my thing. Tunneling (dreaming?) new routes between ideas, times, places, scales… That’s what </span><em>I do</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>I’ve been primed for this realization by my recent reading: Lots of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning literature. In these worlds, everything is “a space.” Mutations are random explorations of genetic </span><em>space</em><span>. Large language models project words into a high-dimensional </span><em>space</em><span> that can be traversed in nearly infinite ways. Little flat worms regenerate body parts in anatomical </span><em>space</em><span>. There are algorithms for “hill climbing” and also for “gradient descent.” Genotypes are subject to “canalization” where they produce the same phenotypes despite genetic variance, as if they can’t help but fall into certain latent canyons of development.</span></p><p>The mathematics of networks turn out to be filled with landscapes, and so, so, so many things can be described with this math, from forests to brains to internet ads to cell regulatory functions to all the language ever written down. So many spaces can be traversed. We need only imagine ourselves capable of travel.</p><p>I conceptualized this newsletter on the Lafayette Ridge Trail yesterday, looking back across the way that I had come, up a few miles and a thousand feet. The trail dipped into and out of view along the knobby ridgeline, patchwork forest on the flanking hillsides. Further to the horizon, Mt Diablo stood above its rapidly greening foothills. Scattered about: Tiny little buildings made by invisible humans. High clouds striped the sky. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2d579ee7-f120-495b-ab1a-69679a394292?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1832669-6d39-4ebf-a13c-f5a688df0f8b_3021x1932.png\"></a><figcaption>Note: Diablo not pictured. It was off to my left.</figcaption></figure></div><p>And I was thinking, actually, about conversations between my wife and me. I was thinking, more precisely, about conversational “space.” We are two whole universes connected, anchored by very deep connection, but there are a thousand books worth of experiences that belong to one of us alone. You spend 17 years together and we know the easy paths to each other. They are well-marked, assiduously maintained, no poison ivy. But how much more are all of us  — are the hillsides — than the well-worn trails? </p><p>Every person on this earth is a monstrously huge landscape, and yet, we can drop into any of it with a simple incantation, the right string of words piped through this sparse interface. At a bus stop, taking in two dogs playing, paying for a muffin—you might unveil a secret path to walk for a year or just a few feet. I have been blessed with my mother’s gift of easy connection to others. But what is the nature of that gift? It’s saying: hey, that seems interesting, wanna go there? As simple as stepping off the trail to point out a mushroom.</p><p>Anything can open up a hillside to explore. But often, it is the components of conversations that open up the rest of me: an unexpected question, someone else’s lingering shower thought, a feral conjecture about the world, free empathy, a true thing offered, a scrambled memory reassembled in real time. </p><p><span>The writer </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/252be63b-07ed-4933-b97d-905c232a462b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmk4YzRmIn0.NbJspE6qqiyi0ePIaEvS-GzrrsOthuf2vAgC26cJb08\">Oliver Burkeman came on Forum this week</a><span>, and a piece of advice he gave struck me: make choices in life that enlarge you. </span></p><p><span>I start from the proposition that </span><em>we are</em><span> </span><em>all very very very large</em><span>.

No, everything your body and mind can do can only be known through this present moment, through doing the thing, through living. Every memory exists only </span><em>now</em><span> at the moment you pull it from the space where it has been encoded, and </span><em>reimagine </em><span>it. Remembering and dreaming and experiencing are not as different as they might seem. </span></p><p><span>Our minds can be hilariously literal, and I believe that exploring new physical terrain can make it easier to find new inner vistas.

And somewhere nestled in there, a self exists that, for reasons that no one can quite explain, wants to do things, wants to get places. That agency feels like the key to understanding the nature of life, and yet it is still mostly just an observed fact. The big question is not: why do I want to do X or Y, but why does anything want to do anything at all? </p><p>This is where my next project is headed.

Chimichangas, too, which seemed to flirt with racism in concept and execution. There were many things like that in those days: maple syrup, Apu, Steve Urkel, Taco Tuesday, our school mascot being the Rebels, how people said African American sometimes. They also outright declared the n-word, rarely though. More common: beaner and spic and wetback, my least favorite. But laughing in the bright lights of the AM/PM, gorged on Nintendo 64, what beautiful fucking idiots, I can’t hate any of them. Did they have much choice?</p><p>There and back, I’d stop on the overpass, the endless river of cars below me, and I would get that Scientific American feeling. Cosmological vertigo. The vastness of everything, the individual lives of all those people, every unknown story playing out on some stupid night in 1997, floating on history, wrapped in personal drama, precisely dimensioned and textured, how much it mattered to every rushing car that they get where they were going.</p><p>Before I knew the names of trees, before I felt something go quiet when I found myself alone on the trails, before I could appreciate the ocean as something to look at, before I knew regret, before I began to notice the color of the light in early December, before I would wake with a child on my chest, or tugging at my sleeve, before I liked to wake up to a quiet house and make coffee in the dim pre-dawn, this monstrous freeway was my access point to infinity, this dull roar through the trees, this stream of lights: you can’t tell me it was not sublime. The sublime! </p><p>Endangered butterflies, massive rainforest fungi, blue whales, tardigrades, mantis shrimp, the whole corvid family, bristlecone pines, weltwischia mirabilis, a finch with a funny nose, reindeer, amoebas, blue-green algae, flatworms, those huge crabs at the bottom of an ocean trench, the hundred million fish no one has ever seen, even once, the dragonflies, the beavers, the tiny bird you almost saw yesterday, the cloud of bacteria coming out of your nose and mouth, the earthworm, and yes, truckers and travelers and people working the graveyard shift at PDX and middle school boys drunk on the weakest independence.</p><p>What right does anyone have to imagine they are not just a manifestation of the whole, a piece, a component, an envelope around and inside many beautiful layers, a nearly arbitrary circle drawn around unstoppable endless wriggling like a net full of anchovies that’s also made of anchovies in an ocean of more anchovies. </p><p>Life is ridiculous.</p><p>On the overpass, some dipshit would always joke about dropping something on the cars below.

In cross-border cases, there may be significant debate about whether (or how) Purdue Pharma applies to the question of whether nonconsensual third-party releases can (or should) be approved. Several cases hold that non-consensual third-party releases may be permissible under Chapter 15, but there may be avenues for creditors and other stakeholders to argue that such releases are categorically prohibited under Purdue or barred by the public policy exception under section 1506. However, (i) as made explicit in the Supreme Court’s opinion, the holding in Purdue is narrowly tailored to its own facts, (ii) the Court in Purdue was clear that its decision was a textual one not based on public policy; and (iii) though not binding precedent, some bankruptcy courts that have approved non-consensual third-party releases in recent Chapter 15 cases prior to Purdue Pharma have stated that even if non-consensual third-party releases are categorically prohibited under Chapter 11 by subsequent binding case law, that relief may nevertheless be appropriate under Chapter 15. Without express statutory authority under the Bankruptcy Code for approval of non-consensual third-party releases in Chapter 15 cases, however, stakeholders may use the Purdue Pharma decision to argue against such releases in Chapter 15 cases, and lower courts may reach differing conclusions on the issue.”</em></p><p><strong>Brett Miller</strong><span>: </span><em>“South America.

As for an evolution: after the initial wave of LMEs, we had started seeing a “kinder, gentler” LME, where excluded lenders were offered the opportunity to participate in the transaction on somewhat less favorable economics. I think what we’re starting to see is a growing disparity between the economics for the participating lenders and the economics for the excluded lenders.

So for the last piece of the year, I want to tell you about my awakening to magic and my sense that the world is being re-enchanted. It’s a little wispy – I’m trying to make sense of a bunch of things – and not meant to be the final word.</p><p>Instead, I hope it gives you some things to think about and explore over the holidays, and gives me a starting point for some deeper and more coherent exploration in 2025.</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f6cef281-5130-4c3a-830d-0a8eeac03c94?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b83a99-71ce-4e25-a33e-23a17fce0879_1200x600.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>On December 1st, I started listening to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes.</em></p><div><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_72,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fthumbnail-play.png\"></div><img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a8886cd685dd33000cece05bb\"><p>The Telepathy Tapes</p><p>Ky Dickens</p><p>Podcast</p><p>By December 2nd, about halfway through Episode 9, I believed in God.</p><p>That is a weird thing to write. When I say “believed in God,” I don’t mean that I’ve joined a Church. I’m not trying to convert you. I went out drinking with my friends this weekend and I said “fuck” like a minute ago. I grew up Catholic and this is a very different experience.</p><p>I just kind of know that there’s a Universal Consciousness, that we’re all a part of it, and that the world is more magical than we’ve been led to believe.</p><p>This is not my own idea. It’s not even a new idea. It’s a very old one. This is what Jesus was saying, and the Buddha, and Rumi. It is the Perennial Philosophy: all major religious and spiritual traditions ultimately point to the same universal truth or reality. I didn’t grok that at all until two weeks ago.</p><p><span>In 1945, Aldous Huxley (</span><em>the </em><span>Aldous Huxley), penned a book by that name, </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9405db7e-adbc-42b5-b9cc-4b7f3b192978?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Perennial Philosophy: An Interpretation of the Great Mystics, East and West</a></em><span>, writing:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The Perennial Philosophy is primarily concerned with the one, divine Reality substantial to the manifold world of things and lives and minds. But the nature of this one Reality is such that it cannot be directly and immediately apprehended except by those who have chosen to fulfill certain conditions, making themselves loving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit. Why should this be so? We do not know. It is just one of those facts which we have to accept, whether we like them or not.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Huxley’s anthology, which I only began reading after listening to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes</em><span>, is one of a growing library of books, videos, and experiences that all point in the same direction, back at the </span><em>Tapes.</em></p><p><span>My experiences over the past month, including but certainly not limited to </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes,</em><span> have made me believe a few things:</span></p><ol><li><p>That God is real, whether you call it God, Universal Consciousness, or something else.</p></li><li><p>That Consciousness is fundamental, and that we are all a part of it.</p></li><li><p>That the world is on the verge of waking up to this truth.</p></li><li><p>The world is becoming more magical again as it does.</p></li></ol><p>Oddly, the best way to describe what I’m talking about is the Midwit Curve.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/1ebdd2b1-9e19-48d9-ab70-032caa7ddbe2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F910e7d7c-29ab-4b74-9dd3-15fd1b4593df_908x515.png\"></a></figure></div><p>The Midwit Curve usually represents a comparison of different people at the same moment in time. The very low IQ person and the really high IQ person agree. The midwit – the one just smart enough to overthink it – overthinks it.</p><p>The left and right are driven by intuition; the midwit is driven by thought. The left and right realize they know nothing; the midwit thinks he knows everything. The left and right are unattached to their ideas; the midwit is crying trying to convince you his are right.</p><p>The real beauty of the midwit curve, though, is that while it presents as a static thing – some people are just low IQ and some are just high IQ – it’s also dynamic.</p><p>It’s a journey each of us goes through individually, and that we go through as a society.</p><p>We start out knowing nothing on the left, learn a lot from books and move to the middle, and then learn enough from experience, if we’re lucky, to end up on the right.</p><p>From intuition due to lack of alternatives, to reason, to intuition backed by knowledge.</p><p><strong>I think that's where we are: moving past the stranglehold of the dogmatic rational materialist paradigm – the midwit – and towards something both ancient and cutting-edge: a world where technology and magic coexist, where consciousness is as fundamental as matter, and where direct experience matters as much as double-blind studies.</strong></p><p>Another way to think of it is like this:</p><p>2024 was a techno-optimist’s dream.</p><p>SpaceX is catching skyscrapers with chopsticks, Google is borrowing quantum compute from parallel universes, AI keeps getting smarter, crypto has use cases, nuclear is back on the table, robots are folding laundry, cancer is under attack, autonomous vehicles are driving around, and even flying cars, the thing that we were supposed to get instead of 140 characters, are back on the menu. The 140 characters are humming, too. We did it, y’all.</p><p><strong>The future we were promised is finally here.</strong></p><p>It feels like we’re approaching technology’s end game. The Fukuyaman “End of Technology.”</p><p><span>Of course, we still need to build the things. We need to give the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/f51f0e16-b6b7-481e-9a42-ded45dde92e4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">curves</a><span> time to play out. But there is growing consensus on what the future looks like.</span></p><p>We will use atomic and solar energy to power abundance, travel at greater speeds with greater levels of autonomy across the globe, colonize the Moon, then colonize Mars. With gene and cell therapies, we will first cure disease, and then expand what the human body can do. Our agents will do mundane work for us, while we do art or whatever. They’ll help accelerate progress in science and engineering, and speed up the inevitable arrival of Dyson Spheres and O’Neill Cylinders and fully compliant humanoid servants with whom we will communicate via our Brain Computer Interfaces.</p><p>This all sounds like sci-fi, and a few years ago, people would have told you you were crazy for believing any of it, but now… it seems kind of inevitable, right? A matter of when, not if.</p><p><strong>The fact that it seems so obvious, though, is a sign that it </strong><em><strong>won’t </strong></em><strong>play out like that.</strong></p><p>My hunch is that studying consciousness will add new and unpredictable richness to our capabilities, and set us down a new branch. </p><p>To be clear: this is just my own intuition, backed by a little knowledge and a lot of clues, as someone who is in the middle of my own ride down the backside of the Midwit Rollercoaster.</p><p><span>I do not have an airtight, falsifiable argument to support my intuition. I have a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/97683e74-b416-4b8c-96ce-6bc5ea7159a9?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">cumulative case</a><span>: individually imperfect pieces of evidence that, taken together, suggest something real. The cumulative case argument is also known as the </span><em>argument from the abundance of arguments</em><span>.</span></p><p>This piece has been the hardest for me to write of the entire year. Not in some spiritual or emotional way; in a literal way: there is just an abundance of individually half-baked arguments that I need to wrangle into something coherent.</p><p>Coherence may not be possible, so I’m just going to give you the stream.</p><p>By the end of the essay, I don’t want to have convinced you of anything.</p><p>I just want to spark some curiosity heading into the holiday break, and share some things to read, watch, and listen to during the slowness.</p><p>Maybe you’ll feel that the world is a little more magical; maybe you’ll think I’m crazy.</p><p><span>Maybe you’ve been feeling the magic return yourself already and </span><em>you’ll</em><span> feel a little less crazy.</span></p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>I’m going to take you on my own personal journey to show you how I was convinced despite the absence of peer review. Then we’ll talk a little bit about why now and what it might mean.</p><p>This is a starting point for what I hope is a much deeper exploration in the coming years, as consciousness and technology harmonize and we become more aware of the universe’s magic.</p><p>Shall we start with a synchronicity?</p><h3><strong>The PKD Synchronicity</strong></h3><p>One Friday night one month ago, after I put Dev and Maya to bed, I got cozy on the downstairs couch and turned on Jesse Michels’ interview with Riz Virk:</p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bfda3427-36b8-46b6-88b3-602a45d545ce?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/aKZ_MUbuk_Q\"></a><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/50e84552-5941-4563-8b4d-58a86abf7c7a?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Jesse</a><span> makes documentaries exploring consciousness, UAPs, and the nature of reality - his show, </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bfcfca9f-5d19-4adc-bba7-5d136b9b7a4c?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">American Alchemy</a><span>, is my only true must-watch. </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/4e73d649-ff5b-40ca-a8d0-8f82891c4252?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Riz</a><span> is an MIT-trained scientist and game developer who theorizes that we live in a </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/c91bedcf-12ec-4842-b120-d3ea948124a3?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">simulated multiverse</a><span>.</span></p><p>There’s this 34 second clip from the video that I want you to watch:</p><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/e09d4c64-bc85-4780-9148-a6769dfef919?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZ63pf33a-Zb2rxxCzcgUen1X6x6lAooB?si=yRnF4Qpgb6M7LqR4</a></p><p>Simulacra.

Welcome to the rest of the journey.</p><p><em>The Telepathy Tapes </em><span>is a documentary podcast by </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/283553f3-c6ca-4a0c-9375-9989c999d1d7?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Ky Dickens</a><span> about non-verbal autistic kids.</span></p><p>It starts as a podcast about those kids’ ability to communicate telepathically with their parents. Then with each other. Then, it’s about a range of special abilities that the kids have beyond telepathy.</p><p>It’s about the scientific establishment’s unwillingness to take their abilities seriously because they don’t fit within the materialist paradigm: the worldview that everything in existence can be explained solely by physical matter, measurable phenomena, and the laws of science (which, in turn, determines what kinds of studies get funded and published).</p><p>And it’s about the existence of God.</p><p>Again, I want you to listen and I don’t want to spoil it. But maybe there are a few things I can say without ruining it:</p><ul><li><p>In the first few episodes, Ky and Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell do a number of experiments to show that these non-verbal autistic children are able to communicate telepathically with their parents, and, less reliably, with others.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Ky and Dr. Powell do their best to make sure the tests are as clean as possible, although skeptics argue parents may be influencing them through touch or signals. More on the skeptics shortly.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><span>It is convincing enough that Puja and I (I made Puja listen with me a second time through) both </span><em><strong>got bored by the repeated successful tests of these kids’ ability to read their parents’ minds</strong></em><span>. It just became obvious they could could telepathically communicate.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It becomes clear that the non-speakers are able to communicate with each other in something many of them call “The Talk on the Hill.” Parents from around the country independently report their kids telling them about “The Talk on the Hill.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>As the episodes progress, the podcast reveals more abilities that certain of the non-speakers have, including precognition, remote sensing, and the ability to learn in their sleep.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Many of the non-speakers say that they go to heaven or the “realms” on certain nights, where they meet with the great minds of history and learn. They come back with knowledge that is inexplicable to their parents.</p></li></ul><p><span>The experiences they claim to have mirror the Perennial Philosophy, and perhaps they are able to access them because, as Huxley would say, their condition makes them</span><em> “loving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit.”</em><span> Why should this be so? I do not know.</span></p><p>To show you what I mean, I’m going to share one quote with you, because it’s central to my case but not central enough to the podcast to spoil it for you.</p><h3><strong>Asher’s Information Field</strong></h3><p>In Episode 9, the one that got me, one of the non-speakers, Asher, talks ( through his teacher, Jess) about his visits to the Realms:</p><p><em><strong>Ky:</strong><span> Asher says that he visits a place called the Realms to access information about any topic. And he talked about a time when his former teacher, Jess, asked him about reincarnation. And he said:</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Asher (via Jess):</strong><span> Well, reincarnation, definitely, yes. But he said it isn't past lives because they're all happening at once, and we're all having all of our lives all of the time, but we're just not aware of that as 3D people. But they're all going on at once, and they interact with each other.</span></em></p><p><em><span>So if something happens in this lifetime and you suddenly get a eureka moment and you find something out that's wonderful and amazing that you hadn't known before, that will actually have repercussions in other lives because they're all interconnected. </span><strong>It's all parts of our soul exploring consciousness in different ways, and we're basically building up huge amounts of information.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Every new thought we have, every new idea we have is new information. And that way, we're expanding the cosmos because each new piece of information that we come up with then goes into this library of his and becomes available for everybody else. But we have to get this knowledge through direct experience in 3D life.</strong></em></p><p>I got goosebumps a number of times listening to the series. When I heard that, I shivered.</p><p>It rhymed with so much.</p><p><span>First, </span><strong>it really sounds like AI model training on a cosmic scale. </strong><span>Humans generate new knowledge, which the AI trains on. Synthetic data doesn’t seem to be working. We have to get this knowledge through direct experience in 3D life.</span></p><p>That’s nuts, right? A non-speaking autistic young man described a mechanism for the expansion of the cosmos that almost exactly mirrors the mechanism for the expansion of artificial intelligence.</p><p><span>Second, </span><strong>that’s just a beautifully expansive way to look at the human experience, isn’t it?</strong></p><p><span>Every new idea, every new direct experience we have expands the cosmos. Each of us is a different way for consciousness to explore itself and expand. It makes life intrinsically meaningful, no matter how you live it, while also making life </span><em>more </em><span>meaningful the more fully you live it – the more ideas and experiences and emotions you have.</span></p><p>It even gives a direction to progress and technology: the more people who can live and have more and richer experiences, the better. Growth is good. More energy is good. Expansion among the stars is good. Medicine is good. Whatever increases the number and diversity of lives is good.</p><p>Stop it right here, just assume that Asher is making this all up: it’s still a deeply impressive and profound insight.</p><p><span>But I don’t think he’s making it up, because third: </span><strong>the connections.</strong></p><p><span>I’ve been on a side quest for nearly two years to try to better understand reality a little better, through sci-fi like </span><em>Hyperion Cantos, </em><span>religious philosophy like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man</em><span>, a little Iain McGilchrist, Aldous Huxley’s </span><em>The Perennial Philosophy, </em><span>Paramahansa Yogananda’s </span><em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em><span>, Donald Hoffman’s work on consciousness, and a lot of American Alchemy, among other things.</span></p><p><strong>Asher, a non-speaking young man in England, explained the cosmos in much the same way all of those thinkers, writers, priests, sages, and even physicists throughout history have, in his own unique and novel way.</strong></p><h3><strong>Cosmic Connections</strong></h3><p>That Asher quote was the moment when my belief bit flipped from 0 to 1.</p><p>It all just clicked. It all made sense. It all lined up eerily well. God is real.</p><p>I want to give you the sense of how and why it clicked so instantaneously, after two years of reading and exploring these ideas.</p><p><span>Hearing a non-speaker, someone society had basically assumed was not smart, describe the ideas I’d seen in so many disparate sources </span><em>based on his own experience</em><span> was like finding detailed quantum mechanics equations carved into ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs or a sealed cave with perfectly accurate maps of the modern world inside or a remote tribe that had independently discovered the Transformer architecture.</span></p><p>When completely separate paths lead to the same profound truth, you have to consider that they're both discovering something real.</p><p>So what are those ideas? I’ll try to make some of the connections.</p><p><strong>Asher describes the universal consciousness as a field of information that we feed through our lived experience and knowledge, and describes our lives as our souls exploring this consciousness.</strong></p><p><span>That sounded a lot like the place where I started this journey into consciousness almost two years ago. Specifically, Dan Simmons’ </span><em>Hyperion Cantos. </em><span>More specifically, the fourth and final book in the series: </span><em><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/52775e22-507e-4ddc-9f76-ad0a8c4cf119?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">The Rise of Endymion</a></em><span>, which he wrote in 1997 and I read early in 2023.</span></p><p><span>Near the end of the book, Aenea, the protagonist prophetess, reveals the secret of the Void Which Binds, the underlying fabric of reality that connects all points in space time: </span><strong>it “is a minded thing–it comes from minded things,” is structured from thought and feeling, “an artifact of the universe’s consciousness of itself,” bound by love.</strong></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/53d261da-caea-4735-a110-6452e053f087?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1796,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3826c414-69a8-49e9-be9b-383d5145a64f_898x214.png\"></a><figcaption><em>SPOILER: The Rise of Endymion</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>A lot of readers </span><em>hated </em><span>that explanation. </span><em>Amor Ex Machina</em><span>.

It </span><em>felt </em><span>true. But it was sci-fi; a good starting point, not an answer.</span></p><p><span>Through </span><em>Hyperion</em><span>, I also discovered Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. One of the characters in the first book, the Priest, mentions de Chardin. It took me a while to realize that he was real and that much of the world Simmons had created was based on de Chardin’s concept of the </span><strong>Noosphere</strong><span>.</span></p><p>If the Catholic Church were any good, I would have known about de Chardin. He’s the kind of person who might have kept me Catholic in the first place. He was a French Jesuit priest – my parents and siblings all went to Jesuit colleges – a scientist, paleontologist, theologian, philosopher, teacher, and author. A religious man who combined science and mysticism.</p><p><span>In his 1955 masterwork, </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man</em><span>, de Chardin wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>The time has come to realise that an interpretation of the universe—even a positivist one—remains unsatisfying unless it covers the interior as well as the exterior of things; mind as well as matter. </span><strong>The true physics is that which will, one day, achieve the inclusion of man in his wholeness in a coherent picture of the world.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>His contribution to this effort was the aforementioned Noosphere:</span><strong> a planetary layer of human thought and consciousness that would eventually converge in what he called the Omega Point, where humanity achieves complete spiritual unity with the divine.</strong></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/eb5bc810-d8bd-4f31-b516-e05d18befbce?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1816,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c3a52c-22de-45ea-88bc-5edeac1ad4b8_908x547.png\"></a><figcaption><em>De Chardin’s Layers of Experience, Integral City</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Through this lens, </span><strong>human consciousness and love aren't byproducts of evolution but its driving forces</strong><span>, moving everything toward greater unity and complexity.

Humans have been the possessor of knowledge and only when the growth of knowledge stops does expansion cease.”</p><p>That’s the same thing Asher said.</p><p><span>OK, I know you’re not going to believe me, but now I just re-opened </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man</em><span> to find a quote, and I found this at the end of the Introduction: “We, mankind, contain possibilities of the earth’s immense future, and can realise more and more of them </span><strong>on the condition that we increase our knowledge and our love</strong><span>. [author’s note: are you kidding me!?] That, it seems to me, is the distillation of </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man.”</em></p><p><span>The Introduction wasn’t written by de Chardin himself. It was written, in London in December 1958, by Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldous Huxley, who I quoted above before re-opening </span><em>The Phenomenon of Man</em><span> and re-discovering that a Huxley wrote the introduction. [author’s note: are you fucking kidding me!?]</span></p><p><span>Let’s keep going, back to Asher’s assertion that </span><strong>“each new piece of information that we come up with then goes into this library of his and becomes available for everybody else.”</strong></p><p>If, for whatever reason, you watched the whole American Alchemy video I linked earlier, this might sound familiar.</p><p>Start here, at 23:02, and watch until about 26:40 when Wim Hof says “Kings”:</p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/46c6e20c-2914-4faa-8bb1-08df117a1485?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/aKZ_MUbuk_Q\"></a><p>Here’s the most relevant quote, although the whole clip is fascinating:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>When one person learns a new concept or achieves a breakthrough they might make it incrementally easier for others to reach these new heights.</strong><span> It's like Rupert Sheldrake's Morphic Resonance where if 100 people do a crossword puzzle, and you do a crossword puzzle tomorrow, you're a little more likely to do it accurately.</span></em></p><p><em>Where you're pushing information to the server as well it's almost as if all scientific and material world accomplishments get uploaded to a central repository once that upload occurs a new node downloading that information becomes that much easier.</em></p></blockquote><p>Morphic Resonance is almost exactly what Asher said! Are you KIDDING me?!</p><p>The universe that Asher describes – a network of souls exploring consciousness and building it up through the information they generate – also mirrors the cutting-edge work that UC Irvine’s Donald Hoffman is doing to mathematically derive the universe from a network of conscious agents (like humans).</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7c808089-329d-48e3-9a27-5fb1e2d52966?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1524,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa58f3244-5170-469b-8e2d-7efbe2ac6047_762x647.png\"></a><figcaption><em>Fusions of Consciousness, Hoffman et. al</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>This consciousness, Hoffman argues, is more fundamental than matter, more fundamental than spacetime.

But in all 300 pages, this is the one that is </span><em>most </em><span>aligned with </span><em>The Telepathy Tapes:</em><span> human broadcasting stations, “transferred his thoughts effectively to another person,” “antenna of intuition,” “all thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos,” “detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead.” Come on! </span></p><p>Like de Chardin, Paramahansa Yogananda even talks about communications technology as an intimation that man is an all-pervading spirit! Come ON!</p><p><span>The one line on the page that I didn’t highlight, the last one which spills over to the next page, I didn’t think was </span><em>as</em><span> relevant until I started writing this piece. Now that I’m re-reading it, here it is:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“</span><strong>Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena may yet appear, which, when once established, will not astonish us more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us during the last century,</strong><span>” Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in physiology, has declared.</span></em></p><p><em>“It is assumed that the phenomena which we now accept without surprise, do not excite our astonishment because they are understood. But that is not the case. If they do not surprise us, it is not because they are understood, it is because they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to surprise us, we should be surprised at everything—the fall of a stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet.</em></p><p><em><span>The science of today is a light matter....Those amazing truths that our descendants will discover are even now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak; and yet we do not see them. </span><strong>But it is not enough to say that we do not see them; we do not wish to see them—for as soon as an unexpected and unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of the commonplaces of accepted knowledge, and are indignant that anyone should dare to experiment further.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>I giggled when I read that. Nearly a century later, and we’re still saying the same thing.</p><p>So that’s my experience. Some synchronicities, a podcast, and a lot of connections. An abundance of arguments, none of which would hold much water individually, but all of which have combined to make me believe in something bigger and more magical.</p><p>Less than a month in, I am obviously at the beginning of that infinite journey, but it’s fun and very, very different from my experience growing up Catholic. I’d almost describe it as looking for magic all around.</p><p><span>Beyond myself, though, I get the sense that we’re at the beginning of a societal awakening, a </span><strong>Return of Magic.</strong></p><p><span>This year, 2024, set the stage. It’s the year the Vibe Shifted. In his In his year-defining essay, </span><span>Santiago Pliego wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Fundamentally, the Vibe Shift is a return to—a championing of—Reality, a rejection of the bureaucratic, the cowardly, the guilt-driven; a return to greatness, courage, and joyous ambition.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is the refusal to subordinate yourself and your family to the whims and anxieties of activists and bureaucrats and relearning to trust your eyes and ears.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is the rejection of secular liberal materialism and a return to the Christian foundations of the West.</em></p><p><em>The Vibe Shift is a healthy suspicion of credentialism and a return to human judgment.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>The Vibe Shift, in other words, is the return to believing your own experience and intuition instead of delegating truth to the experts.</strong></p><p><span>I think looking back, we’ll see that this year was the beginning of the Downfall of Dogma, or what </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/04a28121-9592-4af4-8f7f-0e70015c5d69?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Iain McGilchrist</a><span>, whose gold-plated academic credentials include Oxford and Johns Hopkins, would call “Left-Brained Thinking.” In a 2023 interview with UnHerd, </span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>I happen to believe our science is not scientific enough. It’s too dogmatic. I happen to believe our reason is not reasonable enough, it’s too dogmatic — and it’s dogma that’s always the problem. </span><strong>We need science, we need reason, but we also need to see that they can’t answer all our questions. Love is very real. </strong><span>Anyone who’s experienced it knows that it’s one of the realest things that can happen to you — but according to science, for it to be real, you’ve got to be able to see it in the lab, measure it, manipulate it.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>A couple of years ago, The Telepathy Tapes may not have broken through to the mainstream.

Should we make these, 🤔?</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Joshua Sussberg (Partner and Member of the Firm’s Executive Committee at Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Creativity. Restructuring professionals continue to evolve and be even more creative year over year. The desire for companies to avoid chapter 11 filings and the attendant costs (and long drawn out battles), has forced professionals to think even more outside of the box to solve problems. Anyone can get a company into chapter 11. But keeping a company out takes significant creativity and deal making skills that necessitate an acute sense of awareness of the overall situation, business goals and stakeholder base. From locking up creditor support early through aggressive NDAs, to managing to salvage free-fall cases on the verge of liquidation, the restructuring industry has been adapting to this changing landscape and only getting better.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Scott Greenberg (Partner and Global Chair of Business Restructuring and Reorganization at Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>LME LME and LME. This was definitely the year that saw a massive uptick in liability management exercises which far outnumbered the amount of traditional filings we saw on our plate.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Sean O’Neal</strong><span> (</span><strong>Partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Continued focus on LME transactions rather than formal proceedings</em><span>.”</span></p><p><strong>David Meyer (Partner, Head of Restructuring and Reorganization, and Member of Management Committee at Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>The continued expansion and evolution of LME and extended use and scope of cooperation agreements. LME is now the expectation rather than the exception, creating opportunities for companies, sponsors, and creditors to achieve out-of-court transactions. This trend impacts and will continue to impact the entire industry, including the way in which smart restructuring leaders staff and train their practice groups.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Eisenband (Global Segment Leader of FTI Consulting’s Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring Group)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Creditors’ willingness to ‘kick the can’ with many distressed exposures to avoid a formal restructuring. Distressed debt exchanges (DDE) will account for nearly 55% of all default events this year per S&amp;P — an all-time high — and it has been close to 50% for the last few years. Creditors continue to take a flyer on teetering credits with these DDEs despite the demonstrated tendency of many of them to subsequently re-default and the diminished recovery prospects of another DDE or bankruptcy filing. Hope dies hard, and so the pipeline of future restructuring activity continues to build.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Brian Bolin (Partner at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>The “offered to all” version of the non-pro rata uptier transaction. The first iteration of non-pro rata uptiers (e.g., Serta, Trimark, Boardriders, etc.) involved a majority lender group exchanging its debt into priming debt in return for new-money financing, debt discount, or other concessions, with the minority lenders being left out of the transaction. Beginning in 2023 with Robertshaw and Rodan + Fields, and accelerating in 2024 with GoTo Group, Apex Tool, EyeCare Partners, United Site Services, and others, issuers have been following this initial exchange with a second-step exchange offer to the minority lenders, albeit often on less advantageous terms. In some cases issuers have been able to obtain nearly 100% participation in the second-step exchange, allowing them to maximize debt discount, extend maturities, minimize litigation risk, and ultimately avoid (or at least delay) the need for a full-blown restructuring.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Cullen Speckhart (Partner and Chair of Business Restructuring at Cooley LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Upswing in issues related to uptiers. In 2024 we’ve learned quite a bit about strengths, weaknesses, and questionable characteristics of various LME transactions (in particular, uptier exchanges and similar transactional permutations). We’ve received some mixed messages on how to predict the outcome of litigation challenges (Serta, Robertshaw, Incora), and we continue to await guidance from the Fifth Circuit regarding applicability and meaning of open market purchase provisions in credit agreements. Meanwhile, new blocking provisions are popping up in loan contracts purporting to prohibit uptiers, while cooperation agreements mandating that all participating creditors act as a group in restructuring negotiations are becoming more common.”</em></p><p><strong>Damian Schaible (Partner and Co-Head of Restructuring at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Liability Management 2.0 — Gone are the days of the “left behind” non pro rata deal. Like a troublesome toddler who grows into a precocious and crafty pre-teen, LM has grown up from its litigious and messy roots to become more strategic and organized (but no less problematic). The transactions are almost always driven opportunistically by sponsors and the non pro rata elements (differential economics and exchange ratios) are designed to coerce full participation and avoid litigation.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Ryan Preston Dahl (Partner and Chair of Business Restructuring at Ropes &amp; Gray LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>The proliferation, if not ubiquity, of the co-op agreement and its continued evolution. At the risk of making an obvious point, co-op agreements were far and away the exception, not the rule, 4 or 5 years ago. Now, co-ops, and their limitations, are almost ‘the’ defining feature of the liability management process: Who gets to sign the co-op? Who gets to extend the co-op? Under what conditions? What other rights do co-op parties have? Are co-op parties even able (or willing) to enforce those rights? Those questions are becoming much more relevant by the day, and that is not stopping.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Handler (Partner at King &amp; Spalding LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>In the syndicated loan space, Cooperation Agreements have evolved to play a significant role in setting table for restructuring transaction. This was a major talking point in 2024.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Sanjeev Khemlani (Chairman of Senior Lending Advisory at Lazard)</strong><span>: “</span><em>While not emergent, the acceleration of liability management transactions and the role of private credit as the proverbial bid away are key themes of 2024. Companies no longer just view their credit agreements as an obligation, but at times, an asset that allows it to extend the runway and preserve optionality. Furthermore, as capital allocated to private credit continues to grow, the market has served as the bid away for issuers as their advisors open negotiations around discount capture, maturity extension, rate reduction, and raising incremental liquidity.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Erica Weisgerber (Partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Liability management, of course! Notwithstanding continued litigation in the background, the market has made it clear that liability management transactions are here to stay. In typical restructuring industry fashion, when an idea works, it is iterated on — mechanics and structures tweaked, bells and whistles added — until the concept is pushed to its logical extreme. Only when ensuing litigation outcomes conclusively and decisively suggest that the risk outweighs the reward will the pendulum swing back in the other direction. We don’t appear to be there yet.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Brett Miller (Partner and Co-Chair of Restructuring at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP)</strong><span>: </span><em>“The quickie bankruptcy — file with an RSA but have a sale process immediately teed up under which the parties to the RSA can decide whether to go forward with a sale or do a debt/equity deal. In and out in under 120 days.”</em></p><p><strong>Jeffrey Cohen (Partner and Chair of Bankruptcy &amp; Restructuring at Lowenstein Sandler LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>It’s not every year that the restructuring industry needs to “slip and move” in response to a SCOTUS ruling that impacts nearly every large chapter 11 filing. In 2024, courts began to set post-Purdue parameters on what qualifies as consent to a third party release. So “creditor consent” is the biggest theme emerging out of 2024 … who knew?</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Andy Dietderich (Partner and Co-Head of Global Finance &amp; Restructuring at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>The return of workouts driven by buy-and-hold lenders with giant AUM and modest return expectations, rather than opportunistic funds with modest AUM and giant return expectations. We used to call those types of lenders “banks.” And they had internal workout departments for a reason. In the near future several funds with massive AUM and boring-but-safe workout teams will dominate the creditor side on all the vanilla credits. Cooperation agreements are so old school. When I see a cooperation agreement, I think commercial bankers circa 1970. No one was going to do a drop down on those dudes. They’d turn off your market access with a wink at each other between Martini Two and Martini Three.</em><span>”</span></p><h4><strong>PETITION: What would be your selection for the most </strong><em><strong>impactful</strong></em><strong> restructuring matter of the year and why (don't shamelessly list your own work)?

The decision will alter chapter 11 practice and strategy, at least in the mass tort context, and can be expected to change the dynamics in negotiations with committees and future claims representatives in mass-tort bankruptcy cases. Moreover, follow-on litigation has begun to (and will continue to) proliferate: including issues relating to whether opt-out or opt-in plan provisions constitute a ‘consensual’ release, exculpation, whether a plan provides for the ‘full satisfaction of claims’ against a third-party non-debtor, and more.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Brett Miller</strong><span>: </span><em>“Purdue Pharma (still) - we need to figure out what we are going to do about 3rd party releases.”</em></p><p><strong>Rachael Albanese (Partner and Co-Chair of US Restructuring at DLA Piper LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Purdue for the second year in a row. It’s continuing to impact case strategy, the definition of consent, Congress’s and the public’s view of bankruptcy, etc.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Brian Resnick (Partner and Head of Liability Management &amp; Special Opportunities at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Purdue for another year. Market is watching to see what comes next for resolving mega mass tort situations.</em><span>” </span></p><p><strong> Joshua Sussberg:</strong><span> “</span><em>The impact of the Purdue ruling. It is coming up in every single case. And it is the ripple effects of Purdue -- rather than the decision itself -- that is most impactful. The opinion’s ruling is narrow, but some of the lower courts have been reexamining related issues that practitioners thought were fairly settled law. This means more contested confirmation hearings and litigation surrounding release issues even if the economic stakeholders are all supportive of the Plan.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Scott Greenberg</strong><span>: “</span><em>I would say the Purdue decision over the summer was the most important ruling of the year. Its not every year the Supreme’s touch a bankruptcy related case—and the impact on third party releases definitely had a significant impact on the way restructuring professionals looked at chapter 11 as a solution to clean up claims.”</em></p><p><strong>David Meyer</strong><span>: “</span><em>Purdue. Every restructuring matter considers the applicability and fall-out of the Supreme Court’s decision when structuring key points of the restructuring transaction. While it would be an overstatement to say it changes the way deals get structured or the negotiating dynamics in most (but not all) deals, restructuring professionals need to address its impact in every single in-court restructuring over the past calendar year. And we will continue to see similar objections and litigation over the next calendar year.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Eisenband</strong><span>: “</span><em>It seems like old news by now, but the Supreme Court’s June decision prohibiting non-consensual releases of claims against non-debtors in a plan of reorganization makes Purdue Pharma the most impactful case of the year, as the decision will impact bankruptcies for years to come, even beyond mass tort cases, and sent the proposed Sackler settlement back to the drawing board. For all the anticipation around the time of the SCOTUS decision and the immediate reaction, it has gone relatively quiet since.”</em></p><p><strong>Andy Dietderich</strong><span>: “</span><em>Anything using the ridiculously favorable new scheme arrangement in London. On the right facts, that statute rocks. It’s going to be part of the option set for lots of cross-border cases — and clients are going to want firms with real credentials on both sides of the pond.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Michael Handler</strong><span>: “</span><em>Incora.</em><span>” </span></p><p><strong>Sean O’Neal</strong><span>: “</span><em>Situations involving LME transactions (e.g., Incora, Pluralsight, and the like).”</em></p><p><strong>Damian Schaible</strong><span>: “</span><em>Maybe Pluralsight. Liability management (lite) enters the private credit market to much fear and trembling in the market.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Joshua Feltman (Partner and Chair of Restructuring &amp; Finance at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz LLP)</strong><span>: “</span><em>Incora, for two reasons. First, despite the turnover on the bench, the SDTX has remained a go-to venue for its efficient proceedings, and Incora suggests that this efficiency is not inconsistent with a thoughtful approach to challenging issues arising from prepetition LM transactions. Second, the new money tranche of an LM deal taking it on the chin is just inherently big news that will necessarily sober the market some, likely driving participants toward deals with broader participation and consensus.”</em></p><p><strong>Cullen Speckhart</strong><span>: “</span><em>WeWork. It’s impacts were both general in nature at the commercial real estate and coworking industry levels, and also specific as to a large number of stakeholders with direct involvement with the Debtors (to include lenders, landlords, employees and trade). Hard to fathom a case of more sweeping direct and indirect implications in 2024.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Ryan Preston Dahl</strong><span>: “</span><em>Most impactful restructuring, in my mind, is the pending Alex Jones/InfoWars bankruptcy and related sale process. The issues coming out of that case present so many very real tensions we are seeing as a society: the responsibilities and duties associated with free speech, the societal impact of gun control (or the limits of such controls), victims’ rights, the relationship between money and speech, the list goes on. Much as I think uptiers, prepacks, and the like are professionally interesting, those issues are much more important.</em><span>”</span></p><h4><strong>PETITION: What would be your selection for the most </strong><em><strong>clever</strong></em><strong> restructuring matter of the year and why (don't shamelessly list your own work)?

Understanding the potential implications, par investors – at the time holding a minority of the loans – partnered with the revolver banks to launch a transaction with barely 50.1% to protect their interests and advantage their longer-dated bonds.

A great example of clever collaboration to achieve a solid outcome for the company and its stakeholders.</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>Brett Miller</strong><span>: “</span><em>To quote Spinal Tap, ‘there is a fine line between stupid and clever….’ Some of the quickie bankruptcies have failed miserably (no bids and the lenders really don’t want to own the company) while others have worked out well.”</em></p><p><strong>David Meyer</strong><span>: “</span><em>AMC.

UVA was always well coached, ready to play, disciplined, and a contender to win the ACC and the national championship in any given year. In many ways, their program reflects how any strong professional services organization should be run, and I have great admiration (based on what I know) for how Bennett managed his team and developed players to be both successful basketball players and people. It is devastating to that program to lose him, particularly on the eve of the start of the college basketball season.

The company’s latest chip quantum chip, Willow, represents a major leap forward in the field of quantum computing. And, if we crack quantum computing…basically any problem that can be solved, will be solved. Cryptography. Materials science. Drug discovery. Point a quantum computer at these extremely complex topics, and a question that would take previous generations of supercomputers extremely (extremely) long periods of time to answer, can be in answered almost instantly. </p><p>There were three big takeaways from Google’s announcement of Willow.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong><span> Willow effectively reduces error rates as the number of qubits increases, overcoming a major hurdle in quantum computing and paving the way for practical, large-scale quantum machines.</span></p><p><strong>(2)</strong><span> Willow, can perform in under five minutes computations that would take today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, showcasing unprecedented processing power.</span></p><p><strong>(3)</strong><span> The founder of Google Quantum AI, Hartmut Neven, wrote that that Willow’s performance was so powerful that it “had to have 'borrowed' the computation from parallel universes.” The chip is so powerful that it implies the existence of the multiverse.</span></p><p>By the way, this is Hartmut Neven… </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fa381c30-ca6a-49cd-a810-3c8bfbc530e8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61770993-4a4e-4e70-8a9e-e350fe9b9e67_2228x1255.png\"></a></figure></div><p><span>We’re not technical enough to understand whether Willow is </span><em>the </em><span>breakthrough that unlocks quantum, but we’re practiced enough vibe readers to suspect that this is the dude who’s going to make it happen. </span></p><p>We’re extremely excited to watch this space as quantum computing moves out of the lab and into practical real-world use cases.

The release marks a significant step forward in the development of agentic AI, systems that can think, plan, and take action on behalf of users. Gemini 2.0 can understand context, generate creative text formats, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions informatively.

Every week there is some big, splashy advancement that pulls forward innovation across the industry. OpenAI launches new product? Cool. The next week Google launches a similar product, but faster. The next week Meta launches an open sourced version of that product. The following week Anthropic launches a more thoughtful version of the product. And then finally OpenAI (or any of the players) just totally start the cycle again with another big release. What’s happening in AI is the most legible, public display of innovation I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. That’s not only good for AI development, but I’m guessing it also pulls forward innovation in other industries — AI is just setting the example that you can move industries forward both thoughtfully and quickly. </p><p><strong>(4)</strong><span> </span><strong>Trump Permitting Reforms</strong></p><p><em>From Donald J.

That this policy comes from a former real estate developer, a class of entrepreneur that is particularly weary of permitting regulations and environmental approvals, is not exactly surprising. But in Trump’s America, IT’S TIME TO BUILD, and a policy like this could accelerate large-scale infrastructure and energy projects and attract substantial domestic and foreign investments.</p><p>To be clear, some people really don’t like this plan. They argue this violates NEPA and prioritizes corporate interests over community and environmental impacts. The critics are not exactly wrong — the plan not only likely violates NEPA, but is an outward challenge of it. Whether or not that’s a bad thing, I guess depends on your perspective on NEPA. We’ll see if and how the plan is actually implemented over the coming months. There’s going to be an interesting balance between regulatory oversight and economic growth over the next four years, but who doesn’t like some good ol’ fashioned common sense permitting reform?</p><p><em>From Caltech</em></p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/401b7edc-d906-458f-82c3-e3cac29e9ffb?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/Pafe793c1H4\"></a><p>Wham! Bam! Thank you, Ma’am!</p><p>Caltech researchers developed bioresorbable acoustic microrobots (BAMs)—tiny, hydrogel-based spheres capable of delivering drugs directly to targeted areas within the body. These microrobots can navigate bodily fluids, be directed precisely via external magnetic fields, and release their therapeutic payloads upon reaching specific sites. </p><p>The precise and targeted drug delivery, combined with the fact that the BAMs can safely degrade after use, should reduce side effects and improve treatment effectiveness for various diseases. And the early results are promising: in mouse studies, BAMs effectively reduced bladder tumor sizes. Targeted, precise, safe and effective drug delivery? Yeah, I’ll take that!</p><p>Packy here with a quick ask. We’re two weeks in to Boring News and having a blast.

The problem? The Mithaq led “restructuring” is doing nothing to improve PLCE’s sales decline or, more importantly, cash burn.</p><p>Net sales fell 7.5% in 2Q’24 and then 18.8% in 3Q’24 and while adjusted EBITDA was positive for the two quarters, the company burned through $239mm for the first three quarters of FY’24. That leaves $5.7mm in cash by 3Q’24, a decrease from $13.6mm in 4Q’23. And this is after accounting for all the new money injections from Mithaq.</p><p><span>PLCE’s balance sheet is currently sporting $362.4mm of debt under the revolver and $168.6mm in the new Mithaq term loans, bringing total indebtedness to $531mm. The company thinks the new $40mm Mithaq credit facility and $48.3mm of availability under the revolver will cover the next twelve months of </span><s>cash burn</s><span> operations, but the Mithaq loan doesn’t come for free. It seems the Saudi firm has wised up a bit and started charging an interest rate (SOFR+5%).</span></p><p>We love this comment from the 3Q’24 earnings press release:</p><pre><code><code>“Net interest expense was $10.1 million in the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to $7.9 million in the three months ended October 28, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s revolving credit facility due to the impact of refinancings, and higher interest-bearing borrowings from loans entered into with the Company’s majority shareholder, Mithaq Capital SPC (‘Mithaq’).”</code></code></pre><p>Imagine getting your hands on INTEREST FREE financing along with deferred interest payments, AND THEN STILL COMPLAINING ABOUT INTEREST EXPENSE.** 🙄</p><h5>*Remaining $90mm worth of term loans carry a SOFR+4% interest rate that is deferred until April 30, 2025.</h5><h5>**Deferred interest expense for the Mithaq term loan was $2.1mm for 3Q’24, basically exactly the same as the YoY differential.</h5><div><div><p><span>Thank you for reading </span><strong>PETITION</strong><span>.

That meant that the 286 and 386 processors that followed were backwards compatible with the 8088 in the IBM PC; in other words, Intel, too, had lock-in, and not just with MS-DOS: while the majority of applications leveraged operating system-provided APIs, it was much more common at that point in computing history to leverage lower level APIs, including calling on the processor instruction set directly. This was particularly pertinent for things like drivers, which powered all of the various peripherals a PC required.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s CISC Moat</h3>\n<p>The 8086 processor that undergirded the x86 instruction set was introduced in 1978, when memory was limited, expensive, and slow; that’s why the x86 used Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC), which combined multiple steps into a single instruction. The price of this complexity was the necessity of microcode, dedicated logic that translated CISC instructions into its component steps so they could actually be executed.</p>\n<p>The same year that IBM cut those deals, however, was the year that David Patterson and a team at Berkeley started work on what became known as the RISC-1 processor, which took an entirely different approach: Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) replaced the microcode-focused transistors with registers, i.e. memory that operated at the same speed as the processor itself, and filled them with simple instructions that corresponded directly to transistor functionality. This would, in theory, allow for faster computing with the same number of transistors, but memory access was still expensive and more likely to be invoked given the greater number of instructions necessary to do anything, and programs and compilers needed to be completely reworked to take advantage of the new approach.</p>\n<p>Intel, more than anyone, realized that this would be manageable in the long run. “Moore’s Law”, the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years, was coined by Gordon Moore, their co-founder and second CEO; the implication for instruction sets was that increased software complexity and slow hardware would be solved through ever faster chips, and those chips could get even faster if they were simplified RISC designs. That is why most of the company wanted, in the mid-1980s, to abandon x86 and its CISC instruction set for RISC.</p>\n<p>There was one man, however, who interpreted the Moore’s Law implications differently, and that was Pat Gelsinger; he led the development of the 486 processor and was adamant that Intel stick with CISC, as he explained in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKkY2kZuEw\">an oral history</a> at <a href=\"https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2019/06/102781029-05-01-acc.pdf\">the Computer Museum</a>:</p>\n<div><div><a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/k9yIgNfM?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata\"><img src=\"https://assets.stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-k9yIgNfM.png\"></a></div></div>\n<p>\n  <strong>Gelsinger:</strong> We had a mutual friend that found out that we had Mr. CISC working as a student of Mr. RISC, the commercial versus the university, the old versus the new, teacher versus student. We had public debates of John and Pat. And Bear Stearns had a big investor conference, a couple thousand people in the audience, and there was a public debate of RISC versus CISC at the time, of John versus Pat.</p>\n<p>  And I start laying out the dogma of instruction set compatibility, architectural coherence, how software always becomes the determinant of any computer architecture being developed. “Software follows instruction set. Instruction set follows Moore’s Law. And unless you’re 10X better and John, you’re not 10X better, you’re lucky if you’re 2X better, Moore’s Law will just swamp you over time because architectural compatibility becomes so dominant in the adoption of any new computer platform.” And this is when x86– there was no server x86. There’s no clouds at this point in time. And John and I got into this big public debate and it was so popular.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Brock:</strong> So the claim wasn’t that the CISC could beat the RISC or keep up to what exactly but the other overwhelming factors would make it the winner in the end.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Gelsinger:</strong> Exactly. The argument was based on three fundamental tenets. One is that the gap was dramatically overstated and it wasn’t an asymptotic gap. There was a complexity gap associated with it but you’re going to make it leap up and that the CISC architecture could continue to benefit from Moore’s Law. And that Moore’s Law would continue to carry that forward based on simple ones, number of transistors to attack the CISC problems, frequency of transistors. You’ve got performance for free. And if that gap was in a reasonable frame, you know, if it’s less than 2x, hey, in a Moore’s Law’s term that’s less than a process generation. And the process generation is two years long. So how long does it take you to develop new software, porting operating systems, creating optimized compilers? If it’s less than five years you’re doing extraordinary in building new software systems. So if that gap is less than five years I’m going to crush you John because you cannot possibly establish a new architectural framework for which I’m not going to beat you just based on Moore’s Law, and the natural aggregation of the computer architecture benefits that I can bring in a compatible machine. And, of course, I was right and he was wrong.\n</p>\n<p>Intel would, over time, create more RISC-like processors, switching out microcode for micro-ops processing units that dynamically generated RISC-like instructions from CISC-based software that maintained backwards compatibility; Gelsinger was right that no one wanted to take the time to rewrite all of the software that assumed an x86 instruction set when Intel processors were getting faster all of the time, and far out-pacing RISC alternatives thanks to Intel’s manufacturing prowess.</p>\n<p>That, though, turned out to be Intel’s soft underbelly; while the late Intel CEO Paul Ottelini claimed that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/paul-otellinis-intel-can-the-company-that-built-the-future-survive-it/275825/\">he turned down the iPhone processor contract</a> because of price, Tony Fadell, who led the creation of the iPod and iPhone hardware, told me in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-father-of-the-ipod-tony-fadell/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2FuLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWZhdGhlci1vZi10aGUtaXBvZC10b255LWZhZGVsbC8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczNjM0MTUyNywiaWF0IjoxNzMzNzQ5NTI3LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.nnQr2ebeh7yLNY-2dCQ7-Ifnz2tvvfBP-c39MgYQNU-9QWUMD33rlEr3tsycBxsYMc63_4CI9fCV6xlxzkfncTxxn0rap6IXsKMRIGcb2Z9MlEsS3EbHswYBv33z3Ri6Budn_6nGORcRnDS1fSCfIsvJMeHd-2ZLexNoSAa3DzBdnx9m43lDh7ut-69avDJPEhYPKzXucUArEbQg8zCGwlUyunewNFgI4Z-p3pkf4b69V9UQhACEtgM4THO7sJ2T9T_8W9siIRCQA4o9qwMyiki9ORGEJJ_0Kr77gUaO5CXFaAkUxGSuyMCrDmFrK2yfX6tZVEAce0S25i92Nh1Q2Q\">a Stratechery Interview</a> that the real issue was Intel’s obsession with performance and neglect of efficiency.</p>\n<p>\n  The new dimension that always came in with embedded computing was always the power element, because on battery-operated devices, you have to rethink how you do your interrupt structures, how you do your networking, how you do your memory. You have to think about so many other parameters when you think about power and doing enough processing effectively, while having long battery life. So everything for me was about long, long battery life and why do we do what we do? David Tupman was on the team, the iPod team with me, he would always say every nanocoulomb was sacred, and we would go after that and say, “Okay, where’s that next coulomb? Where are we going to go after it?” And so when you take that microscopic view of what you’re building, you look at the world very differently.</p>\n<p>  For me, when it came to Intel at the time, back in the mid-2000s, they were always about, “Well, we’ll just repackage what we have on the desktop for the laptop and then we’ll repackage that again for embedding.” It reminded me of Windows saying, “I’m going to do Windows and then I’m going to do Windows Mobile and I’m going to do Windows embedded.” It was using those same cores and kernels and trying to slim them down.</p>\n<p>  I was always going, “Look, do you see how the iPhone was created? It started with the guts of the iPod, and we grew up from very little computing, and very little space, and we grew into an iPhone, and added more layers to it.” But we weren’t taking something big and shrinking it down. We were starting from the bottom up and yeah, we were taking Mac OS and shrinking it down, but we were significantly shrinking it down. Most people don’t want to take those real hard cuts to everything because they’re too worried about compatibility. Whereas if you’re just taking pieces and not worrying about compatibility, it’s a very different way of thinking about how building and designing products happens.\n</p>\n<p>This is why I was so specific with that “27 year” reference above; Apple’s 2007 launch of the iPhone marked the end of both Microsoft and Intel’s dominance, and for the same reason. The shift to efficiency as the top priority meant that you needed to rewrite <em>everything</em>; that, by extension, meant that Microsoft’s API and Intel’s x86 instruction set were no longer moats but millstones. On the operating side Apple stripped macOS to the bones and rebuilt it for efficiency; that became iOS, and the new foundation for apps; on the processor side Apple used processors based on the ARM instruction set, which was RISC from the beginning. Yes, that meant a lot of things had to be rewritten, but here the rewriting wasn’t happening by choice, but by necessity.</p>\n<p>This leads, as I remarked to Fadell in that interview, to a rather sympathetic interpretation of Microsoft and Intel’s failure to capture the mobile market; neither company had a chance. They were too invested in the dominant paradigm at the time, and thus unable to start from scratch; by the time they realized their mistake, Apple, Android, and ARM had already won.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s Missed Opportunity</h3>\n<p>It was their respective response to missing mobile that saved Microsoft, and doomed Intel. For the first seven years of the iPhone both companies refused to accept their failure, and tried desperately to leverage what they viewed as their unassailable advantages: Microsoft declined to put its productivity applications on iOS or Android, trying to get customers to adopt Windows Mobile, while Intel tried to bring its manufacturing prowess to bear to build processors that were sufficiently efficient while still being x86 compatible.</p>\n<p>It was in 2014 that their paths diverged: Microsoft named Satya Nadella its new CEO, and his <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/microsofts-mobile-muddle/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE0L21pY3Jvc29mdHMtbW9iaWxlLW11ZGRsZS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczNjM0MTUyNywiaWF0IjoxNzMzNzQ5NTI3LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.btDRnBNqhLK7dpu2ZN5XYOkieCgv3wEsSg8U5HmO5YNlwyTfQzD-BGLzgFuqps5M_bFYHgspH5TURw4DmqFUqAadF1OuiifylrE9ZGW7628MnLb-7qPYOdSiXFvrAhhYObeczN8t-1gioytv7H6DQeGgka0AFxmGWGCJe07YV5m-_OGuInMdalwgDgkTrGBAi9ZcsaaaA39SG4b2RgjL6F1dw4r3vzKBdphD0mv0yeMH6l2KQR9olje_4M-mA0egDIoaorNLaMA_NCRP8MiiqLKBaxU6O9-vLpesmvWPZBZrdsHO-hHsZ9CAvwOIn0kZJLlfckwObW4Z0mvmknFKCg\">first public decision</a> was to launch Office on iPad.

In fact, today there are only four major foundries: Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Intel. Only four companies have the capacity to build the chips that are in every mobile device today, and in everything tomorrow.</p>\n<p>  Massive demand, limited suppliers, huge barriers to entry. It’s a good time to be a manufacturing company. It is, potentially, a good time to be Intel. After all, of those four companies, the most advanced, by a significant margin, is Intel. The only problem is that Intel sees themselves as a design company, come hell or high water.\n</p>\n<p>Making chips for other companies would have required an overhaul of Intel’s culture and processes for the sake of what was then a significantly lower margin opportunity; Intel wasn’t interested, and proceeded to make a ton of money building server chips for the cloud.</p>\n<p>In fact, though, the company was already fatally wounded. Mobile meant volume, and as the cost of new processes skyrocketed, the need for volume to leverage those costs skyrocketed as well. It was TSMC that met the moment, with Apple’s assistance: the iPhone maker would buy out the first year of every new process advancement, giving TSMC the confidence to invest, and eventually surpass Intel. That, in turn, benefited AMD, Intel’s long-time rival which now fabbed its chips at TSMC, which not only had better processor designs but, for the first time, had a better process, leading to huge gains in the data center. All of that low-level work on ARM, meanwhile, helped make ARM in PCS and in the datacenter viable, putting further pressure on Intel’s core markets.</p>\n<p>AI was the final blow: not only did Intel not have a competitive product, it also did not have a foundry through which it could have benefitted from the exploding demand for AI chips; making matters worse is the fact that data center spending on GPUs is coming at the expense of traditional server chips, Intel’s core market.</p>\n<h3>Intel’s Death</h3>\n<p>The fundamental flaw with Pat Gelsinger’s 2020 return to Intel and his <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-unleashed-gelsinger-on-intel-idm-2-0/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxL2ludGVsLXVubGVhc2hlZC1nZWxzaW5nZXItb24taW50ZWwtaWRtLTItMC8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczNjM0MTUyNywiaWF0IjoxNzMzNzQ5NTI3LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.f8QlMk73uMQbfl5UgM_o_wnM3g6ZyygpzKwOBBp7ELkQqIjDqqKHNQUQjwHX6Cyubw8gmoPdEG6zbqG_eSJ24JCl9smoA1cVjJ3mcC4_YRlBIMXrbwtb333JK0bhkZvNzRqE_RTWsqc5PuT2H_ntHwdlcbfvZBCLID6WCPYrUevF3q9-bifunZXY42SFQYNav3yr7egwaA1brQH1ktNoeRkCldungRGrl0FD4ZjPYw_vN4lPyg43cnBrpN5r9xGQSsPm-6e2vPNpQwAbmah5ZY-tWrbSDw40U7Mpjk7qULkEhwsBFlQXp0lf1GkgrZe6T5briGOGoeppjSD96jIBfA\">IDM 2.0 plan</a> is that it was a decade too late. Gelsinger’s plan was to become a foundry, with Intel as its first-best customer. The former was the way to participate in mobile and AI and gain the volume necessary to push technology forward, which Intel has always done better than anyone else (EUV was the exception to the rule that Intel invents and introduces every new advance in processor technology); the latter was the way to fund the foundry and give it guaranteed volume.</p>\n<p>Again, this is <em>exactly</em> what Intel should have done a decade ago, while TSMC was still in their rear-view mirror in terms of processing technology, and when its products were still dominant in PCs and the data center. By the time Gelsinger came on board, though, it was already too late: Intel’s process was behind, its product market share was threatened on all of the fronts noted above, and high-performance ARM processors had been built by TSMC for years (which meant a big advantage in terms of pre-existing IP, design software, etc.). Intel brought nothing to the table as a foundry other than being a potential second source to TSMC, which, to make matters worse, has dramatically increased its investment in leading edge nodes to absorb that skyrocketing demand. Intel’s products, meanwhile, are either non-competitive (because they are made by Intel) or not-very-profitable (because they are made by TSMC), which means that Intel is simply running out of cash.</p>\n<p>Given this, you can make the case that Gelsinger was never the right person for the job; shortly after he took over I wrote in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxL2ludGVsLXByb2JsZW1zLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2MzQxNTI3LCJpYXQiOjE3MzM3NDk1MjcsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.XNqAJpxSRh_sPkXrbM9dPq4td6OyjHhD7Txtd1svCH6sP5aZGiM8aBLuUqPwCLfbBHgzzQKQqMPN8bn1Q945eZ2FOhhoPQ_vwrFQvm-0n1RCV4DBCXjKzWoeqX1PvwN5BUFuCXgJAoGV6X5LEVAm3_cE_xf1GSiQ0MdDkViJOpv_lr-XVAPKlYCJmoHhpsPWtHgwTTl9xfYihptE3BMw6CMZyJSvf1v0S1zX8nCQrhPbxW6gKbRGGFxEiqLy9lhMtY8Vp2DlPJSEJxJMH54yjPm8bS4gvHcX0RP4QscmJT45onNbn2GFsv7lvepa_Na7oiDEkNMwbRGzbx9DZlKn_g\">Intel Problems</a> that the company needed to be split up, but he told me in a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2FuLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWludGVsLWNlby1wYXQtZ2Vsc2luZ2VyLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2MzQxNTI3LCJpYXQiOjE3MzM3NDk1MjcsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.rSsmc2J7crZaPmTW12iEkW8gRBr-DXnxFzyeiNelM-Y94-oAru_BQo_CRhXIwu0xicdo8kDwnFFVOnIHLWdVa8Rlz3UNMQCHL14h086oxtYd6K9j6XPz-_pZohKVNWsYHtJeAZANe8mNDIPt_nq5VCxVfFEvftG-7yBn-xJMRN8By0P4KhW-tbX3uBJ43ojkyTdA2vnB8u-IKZ5psxsB2389bDg6xJu7B4CCP53U55SIhsQq8kWN8BGURea2uFovXwkfNiSIQT82yap1VipLAxScYT2xRNOGudeaNWsOnOlX_w18t77_RdVJ5i22mrvr_2TGNVzZjw_WzrWhAEIRhQ\">2022 Stratechery Interview</a> that he — and the board — weren’t interested in that:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>So last week, AMD briefly passed Intel in market value, and I think Nvidia did a while ago, and neither of these companies build their own chips.

Ultimately, though, the benefit to Apple has been profound: the company has the best supply chain in the world, centered in China, that gives it the capability to build computers on an unimaginable scale with maximum quality for not that much money at all. This benefit has extended to every tech company, whether they make their own hardware or not. Software has to run on something, whether that be servers or computers or phones; hardware is software’s most essential complement.\n</p>\n<p>The inverse may be the key to American manufacturing: software as hardware’s grantor of viability through integration. This is what Tesla did: the company is deeply integrated from software down through components, and builds vehicles in California (of course it has an even greater advantage with its China factory).</p>\n<p>This is also what made Intel profitable for so long: the company’s lock-in was predicated on software, which allowed for massive profit margins that funded all of that innovation and leading edge processes in America, even as every other part of the hardware value chain went abroad. And, by extension, the reason why a product focus is a dead end for the company is because nothing is preserving x86 other than the status quo.</p>\n<p>It follows, then, that if the U.S. wants to make Intel viable, it ideally will not just give out money, but also a point of integration. To that end, consider this report from <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-government-commission-pushes-manhattan-project-style-ai-initiative-2024-11-19/\">Reuters</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  A U.S. congressional commission on Tuesday proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart or smarter than humans, amid intensifying competition with China over advanced technologies. The bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stressed that public-private partnerships are key in advancing artificial general intelligence, but did not give any specific investment strategies as it released its annual report.\n</p>\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024_Comprehensive_List_of_Recommendations.pdf\">the report’s recommendation directly</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  The Commission recommends:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Congress establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capability. AGI is generally defined as systems that are as good as or better than human capabilities across all cognitive domains and would surpass the sharpest human minds at every task. Among the specific actions the Commission<br>\n  recommends for Congress:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide broad multiyear contracting authority to the executive branch and associated funding for leading artificial intelligence, cloud, and data center companies and others to advance the stated policy at a pace and scale consistent with the goal of U.S. AGI leadership; and</li>\n<li>Direct the U.S. secretary of defense to provide a Defense Priorities and Allocations System “DX Rating” to items in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to ensure this project receives national priority.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem with this proposal is that spending the money via “public-private partnerships” will simply lock-in the current paradigm; I explained in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L2EtY2hhbmNlLXRvLWJ1aWxkLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2MzQxNTI3LCJpYXQiOjE3MzM3NDk1MjcsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.fTuj0Vt6rPfotrVw7WWuf3h5Vpkh5qA-7FJFnRxoDRyx_tVpJ84P8FWFjno6IPVPtpIfpwZW1y-zh67hgiFDCIGef4Wx3I0Ju145beEkR3Y3UadH2J6cuBaie8_87UTKlW8aZClIxYhhOm3QQe7Gw-ya4ZTu0l7AZWAPUHllc8nZZH3RYM28KPLmGx6-ZjcbGcKemmI8LlY4uvA6pPYI-JVuEDseYxEUyYjgBlHt16sak6DvEiaD74c3sMhZpt_fbnXp1q0HjoSKHsUXE4_eUAlyZdraYYSqiquNdbud4FX_nFd_KwS3Zeg_KipBtYMcyOrqj7j19mef9SBYu8Frjg\">A Chance to Build</a>:</p>\n<p>\n  Software runs on hardware, and here Asia dominates. Consider AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chip design, a zero marginal cost activity, is done by Nvidia, a Silicon Valley company.</li>\n<li>Chip manufacturing, a minimal marginal cost activity that requires massive amounts of tacit knowledge gained through experience, is done by TSMC, a Taiwanese company.</li>\n<li>An AI system contains multiple components beyond the chip, many if not most of which are manufactured in China, or other countries in Asia.</li>\n<li>Final assembly generally happens outside of China due to U.S. export controls; Foxconn, for example, assembles many of its systems in Mexico.</li>\n<li>AI is deployed mostly by U.S. companies, and the vast majority of application development is done by tech companies and startups, primarily in Silicon Valley.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  The fact that the U.S. is the bread in the AI sandwich is no accident: those are the parts of the value chain where marginal cost is non-existent and where the software talent has the highest leverage. Similarly, it’s no accident that the highest value add in terms of hardware happens in Asia, where expertise has been developing for fifty years. The easiest — and by extension, most low-value — aspect is assembly, which can happen anywhere labor is cheap.\n</p>\n<p>Given this, if the U.S. is serious about AGI, then the true Manhattan Project — doing something that will be very expensive and not necessarily economically rational — is filling in the middle of the sandwich. Saving Intel, in other words.</p>\n<p>Start with the fact that we know that leading AI model companies are interested in dedicated chips; OpenAI is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-builds-first-chip-with-broadcom-tsmc-scales-back-foundry-ambition-2024-10-29/\">working on its own chip with Broadcom</a>, after flirting with the idea of building its own fabs. The latter isn’t viable for a software company in a world where TSMC exists, but it is for the U.S. government if it’s serious about domestic capabilities continuing to exist. The same story applies to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta.</p>\n<p>To that end, the U.S. government could fund an independent Intel foundry — spin out the product group along with the clueless board to Broadcom or Qualcomm or private equity — and provide price support for model builders to design and buy their chips there. Or, if the U.S. government wanted to build the whole sandwich, it could directly fund model builders — including one developed in-house — and dictate that they not just use but deeply integrate with Intel-fabricated integrated chips (it’s not out of the question that a fully integrated stack might actually be the optimal route to AGI).</p>\n<p>It would, to be sure, be a challenge to keep such an effort out of the clutches of the federal bureaucracy and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-gregory-allen-about-transforming-u-s-defense/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L2FuLWludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWdyZWdvcnktYWxsZW4tYWJvdXQtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLXUtcy1kZWZlbnNlLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2MzQxNTI3LCJpYXQiOjE3MzM3NDk1MjcsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiV1JDWFY3TjVWVnNaWnplbmJFZzdIRSIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.QQeb_r4qSHURgFa_eBQyDIYoYS2XhpWkjjtN7cLkS0aA_p8cqM7HJFnJfBOr2BE8NzgU5kHzPiIhuJq89fohslHFfbIFQ8N3MkAHcHNwUdR9mTTSf27qJagiwNAEeU2MwK-DL8bEZlS0dmty5YhKPxAdb-l0XBEojtzPh6_rFHpLY29HnhamlM0njHJVRO2nJ5Pa5yLHUTFwTdMer9eon0SF1gS6gZx26xFjm2ZOcqa6GWkNo6Om7HaggClyoxbkV4VsxA92gwSiI9fPeOlwQ3uhXpKtmKnhSDaGdRuwty3-qUqHXWDbXMYdsvk-u0QXLHl0SUZeX1L53O-V1j2Uog\">the dysfunction that has befallen the U.S. defense industry</a>. It would be essential to give this effort the level of independence and freedom that the original Manhattan Project had, with compensation packages to match; perhaps this would be a better use of Elon Musk’s time — himself another model builder — than DOGE?</p>\n<p>This could certainly be bearish for Nvidia, at least in the long run. Nvidia is a top priority for TSMC, and almost certainly has no interest in going anywhere else; that’s also why it would be self-defeating for a U.S. “Manhattan Project” to simply fund the status quo, which is Nvidia chips manufactured in Taiwan. Competition is ok, though; the point isn’t to kill TSMC, but to stand up a truly domestic alternative (i.e. not just a fraction of non-leading edge capacity in Arizona).

Inc.💥</a></h4><div>Oct 29</div><span>Read full story</span></div><p><span>The debtors filed their cases “</span><em>...with a line of sight to successfully consummate a going concern sale</em><span>” with a bit more than $30mm in cash on hand and an expectation to burn another $95mm of liquidity during the first 13 weeks of the cases.</span><span>¹</span><span> At risk of stating the obvious, the debtors needed a beefy DIP to fund the process, and an ad hoc group of DIP term lenders (the “DIP Term Lenders”)</span><span>²</span><span> was more than willing to graciously lend a hand — and by “graciously lend a hand,” we mean (i) pony up $250mm in new money (with $125mm available during the interim period) (ii) </span><em>while also getting the benefit</em><span> of a roll up of approximately $75mm in 2024 Delayed Draw FILO Loans (iii) </span><em>and</em><span> $750mm (of $975mm) of prepetition term loans on a </span><em>non-pro rata</em><span> basis. Significantly, the DIP Term Lenders hold 100% of the 2024 Delayed Draw FILO Loans and approximately 90% of the prepetition term loans.</span></p><p><span>As our readers undoubtedly remember, way back in June ‘20, </span><strong>Serta Simmons Bedding LLC</strong><span> (“SSB”) attempted something similar in an out of court transaction and closed a “</span><em>liability management exercise</em><span>” that allowed a subset of its lenders to both infuse new capital into SSB and roll up certain of those lenders’ existing debt obligations into new “</span><em>super priority obligations</em><span>” that primed the other lenders in the same facility — in other words, those other non-participating lenders would be left holding the bag if (read: when) the transaction didn’t work and SSB found itself in a formal in-court restructuring proceeding.</span><span>³</span><sup> </sup><span>Shocking no one, the transaction precipitated a significant amount of litigation, both prior to and during SSB’s bankruptcy, and became synonymous with SSB itself — “uptier” and “Serta” are used interchangeably to describe this kind of priming transaction generally. Following similar transactions by other companies and ever-more fallout, lenders started contracting around these issues, requiring, for example, consent from all lenders to subordinate a credit facility’s existing debt to a new tranche (aka a “Serta blocker”) or to provide for a non-pro rata distribution. However, an exception to the Serta blocker also developed where, in the context of DIP financing specifically, unanimous lender consent wasn’t necessary.</span><span>⁴</span></p><p><span>Turning back to our debtors, that exception and its interplay with the prepetition term loan facility’s pro-rata paydown requirements, which are not referenced in the exception, are at the heart of a dispute that’s since arisen in the debtors’ bankruptcy. While the first day hearing proceeded unremarkably,</span><span>⁵</span><span> the following weeks got a lot more interesting: an ad hoc group representing losers … uh, we mean … “excluded lenders” (the “Excluded Lenders”), holding about 7.6% of the debt under the prepetition term loan facility and none too thrilled by being excluded from the party and the resulting prospect of a non-pro rata roll-up in which they wouldn’t be participating, appeared and immediately started lobbing grenades at the DIP.</span><span>⁶</span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6fddfa32-3523-460d-b847-16900ee08568?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_480,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56cf084f-8c3d-433e-9090-51a50bb7fb1c_480x270.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY. The Excluded Lenders on their way to court.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Boiled down, their argument was simple: the roll-up of the prepetition term loans under the DIP violated the prepetition term loan agreement’s pro-rata distribution rules — that is, under that agreement, each lender is entitled to its ratable slice of amounts received on account of the prepetition term loans and to permit otherwise, including as part of a roll-up, would violate those rules.</span><span>⁷</span><span> But they had a simple solution: cut them into the deal and allow them to fully participate in the DIP, extravagant fees and all.</span><span>⁸</span></p><div><figure><a

The brain tissue, in essence, has built-in labels of its various structures and paths of wiring.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d3f916a6-a05c-48b8-acf7-b9d017f434af?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a7d223c-3a21-4267-a597-66aba7fd34ad_2200x1467.webp\"></a></figure></div><p>E11 Bio, a research organization backed by Eric Schmidt, is redefining brain mapping by injecting mouse brains with viruses that label neurons with unique protein barcodes. Basically the approach is like teaching mouse brains to barcode themselves so they can scan their neurons like groceries.</p><p><span>This brain mapping method drastically reduces time and cost, slashing the need for millions of microscope slices and tedious AI proofreading. E11 Bio injects viruses into the brain to create protein barcodes for neurons, enabling researchers to trace neural connections using colorful optical imaging </span><em>(see image above!)</em><span>. This method skips the need for slicing the brain into thousands of pieces and avoids costly, time-consuming manual proofreading and electron microscopy.</span></p><p>If they’re successful, we could have detailed brain maps that unlock breakthrough neurological treatments, advance AI by mimicking brain function, and uncover the fundamental workings of the human mind. Long way to go — brain mapping has traditionally been costly, timely, and too static to provide real-time value — but if teams like E11 are successful, we might finally have a much deeper understanding of how these brains of ours work.</p><p><em>Cho et al in Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em><span>A pilot clinical study showed that DBS</span><sup>LH</sup><span> immediately improved walking in two participants with incomplete SCI and, in conjunction with rehabilitation, mediated functional recovery that persisted when DBS</span><sup>LH</sup><span> was turned off.

A new study revealed a breakthrough approach to restoring walking after spinal cord injuries (SCI) by targeting the brain's lateral hypothalamus (LH) with deep brain stimulation (DBS). In plainer language, the research uncovered a \"walk switch\" in the brain’s lateral hypothalamus, where targeted stimulation can restore walking after spinal cord injuries.</p><p>In animal trials, the research found that activating specific neurons in the LH dramatically improved walking by reorganizing the spinal cord’s remaining neural connections. Excitingly, limited human trials showed that DBS of the LH not only immediately enhanced walking but also led to long-term improvements when combined with rehab, even after the stimulation was turned off.</p><p>About 15M folks worldwide have some form of spinal chord injury and suffer varying degrees of paralysis as a result. Trials are early and the treatment won’t restore walking for everybody, but this is a big…step…toward using precise brain stimulation to repair movement after paralysis.</p><p><em>From Anduril</em></p><blockquote><p><em>By bringing together OpenAI’s advanced models with Anduril’s high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation’s defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b63ae163-afbf-420a-b2cb-eb32644331d4?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1408,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F453586cc-10af-4ad3-90a1-a64082fe9408_704x977.png\"></a></figure></div><p>Technology and Defense.

We’ve covered Isaacman a few times in the Weekly Dose, but if you’re not familiar with him, here’s the quick background: he made billions founding payment processor Shift4 Payments, parlayed that into founding aerospace defense contractor Draken International, and then famously commanded the first all-civilian spaceflight, Inspiration4…and most recently led the Polaris Dawn mission, becoming the first private citizen to perform a spacewalk. And now, in what you can only imagine is a boyhood dream come true, Isaacman has been nominated by President Trump to lead NASA.</p><p><span>Without knowing all of the politics around and nuances of NASA Administration, I feel confident in saying the Isaacman pick was a good one, for a couple of reasons. First, Isaacman is the perfect combination of successful businessman and passionate explorer — which hopefully means he’ll be able to not only run NASA more efficiently and effectively, but will also do so with the zeal of an astronaut missionary. Second, Isaacman has a very, very close relationship with Elon Musk. Musk has been, and likely will continue to be given his new role in the Trump Administration, NASA’s most important partner. If Isaacman can avoid obvious conflicts of interest traps and leverage this relationship with Musk properly, it should mean a much deeper relationship with the world’s most important private space company. And finally, Isaacman just seems like a legitimately great guy — the kind of guy that you look at and think “man, they don’t really make them like that any more.” Family-oriented, seemingly very kind (</span><em>watch the Netflix doc and then tell me otherwise</em><span>), financially successful, patriotic, and…a groundbreaking astronaut? He really is like Iron Man, but if Iron Man was from a middle-class family in Jersey and way less douchey.  </span></p><p>After basically being stagnant for a couple of decades, NASA has started to get its mojo back with more ambitious and inspiring programs. Isaacman could be the man to cement the comeback and restore NASA’s glory. </p><p>Have a great weekend y’all.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/b8da0bf5-b88a-44f2-b7b6-069abe9120d8?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">AlphaSense</a></strong><span> for sponsoring!

But it also seems to be more accurate.</p><p>That said, most people won’t check the charts every day. We’re used to neatly packaged stories that provide the context behind the headlines. If those packaged stories come with bias and sensationalism, well, that’s just the trade we make.</p><p><span>One of the things that technology is best at, however, is eliminating trade-offs.

You could pull from Polymarket, run it through LLMs, and deliver it practically autonomously. Self-driving news: insert market, get full story that changes as the odds do.</p><p><strong>Technically, this is something that could not have been built until this year.</strong></p><p>Prediction markets were too illiquid to be accurate. AI wasn’t powerful or internet-connected enough to provide the relevant context, turn it into a script, or deliver the script in audio format with a realistic voice clone. The tools will only get better, and we expect Boring News to continue to get better as they do (and as we do).</p><p><strong>This is also not something that I could have built myself, even with AI’s help.</strong></p><p>I keep saying “we.” I have a lot of ideas like this, and I execute on basically none of them.</p><p><span>But in late October, 19-year-old Indian cousins </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7f00c71d-4760-4c1e-acc7-c1e91247900f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Aman Matreja</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/3d64fc5e-45c0-4747-a0ff-77dbf3a5b6c2?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Sehaj Pasricha</a><span> cold emailed me about a (different) project they wanted to work on under Not Boring.

There will always be crucial roles for investigative reporting, long-form analysis, and the kind of deep work that helps us understand not just what's happening, but why it matters. What we're trying to do is make the day-to-day news delivery more accurate and less sensational, freeing up human resources and attention for the kind of journalism that truly requires human insight and expertise.</p><p>To that end, Boring News is still very much a work in progress. We're going to try to put out a short, five minute video every weekday and continue to refine it based on your feedback. You might listen to some stories and think, “wtf that’s not what happened!” or “I don’t agree with that explanation!” First: blame the AI. Then: let us know so we can improve it.</p><p>If people like it, we'll work with Polymarket to put more resources behind making it as good as it can be.</p><p>I believe in David Deutsch's Principle of Optimism: \"All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.\" And I believe in Joy's Law: \"No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.\" Prediction markets leverage the latter to solve the former – they incentivize anyone with valuable information to contribute it.</p><p>That's what makes me optimistic about the future of news. Not because of any one project, but because the tools to find truth are getting better and more open. Going direct is open. Markets are open. Smart 19-year-olds anywhere in the world creating with powerful tools is open.</p><p>We won’t be the only ones who try to build something like this, and that’s awesome.</p><p>We're having fun experimenting with these tools to try to make the news a little more boring, and hopefully a little more true.</p><p>The news is dead. Long live the news.</p><p><em>Thanks to Aman, Sehaj, and Mike for building Boring News with me, and to Claude for editing!</em></p><p>That’s all for today.

Indeed, we’ve seen plenty of debtors drop the old Russia/Ukraine war excuse in their bankruptcy papers but never quite like this. Let’s get this party started: </span></p><pre><code><code>“Pursuant to an executive order of Russian President Vladimir Putin, issued in March 2000 shortly after his coming to power, prescribing to “reinstate and protect the state’s rights” in vodka trademarks privatized in the 1990s, the Stoli Group has been defending its rights to the Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya vodka trademarks against Russian state enterprise FKP Sojuzplodoimport over more than twenty-three (23) years in courts of multiple jurisdictions, including the United States. The Stoli Group has been forced to spend dozens of millions of dollars on this long-term court battle across the globe with the Russian authorities.”</code></code></pre><p>“Dozens of millions of dollars” is an odd way of framing that but you get the idea. There’s more: </p><pre><code><code>“In connection with that ongoing litigation and his criticism of the Putin regime, the founder and beneficial owner of the Stoli Group, Mr. Yuri Shefler, has been the subject of personal persecution by the Putin regime. Mr. Shefler was forced to leave Russia in 2002 and has been unable to return since then due to fabricated criminal charges (all of which were eventually dropped). In the 2010s, Russia made extradition requests to the United Kingdom and Switzerland concerning Mr. Shefler, both of which were rejected as unjustified and politically motivated. Mr. Shefler was subsequently granted asylum by Switzerland and UK nationality by the UK government.”</code></code></pre><p><span>For the uninitiated, </span><strong>Shefler</strong><span> is a billionaire whose net worth is estimated, according to the ever-more-</span><em>un</em><span>reliable </span><strong>Wikipedia</strong><span>, at $1.5b as of March ‘22. This dude is something else. You may have heard of him back in 2015 when he offloaded one of the world’s biggest yachts, the </span><em>Serene</em><span>, to </span><strong>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</strong><span> for a piddling $550mm.

Each debtor is a party to a credit agreement with secured lender </span><strong>Fifth Third Bank NA </strong><span>(“Fifth Third”). As of the petition date, Stoli owes ~$41mm under its revolver and KO owes ~$37.3mm under </span><em>its</em><span> revolver (total ~$78.4mm). Starting on July 17, 2024, and then again four times thereafter, Fifth Third driooed default notices on the debtors like their hot, alleging and asserting “</span><em>ongoing defaults</em><span>.” Is being “wanted” by Putin a default? Dating too many models? The bankruptcy papers don’t clarify what the alleged defaults were but clearly Fifth Third was on the warpath: it sent ten letters to KO’s trade vendors, suppliers and storage providers airing all kinds of beef. Suffice it to say, this was disruptive to the business. </span></p><p><span>The debtors efforts to negotiate a resolution with Fifth Third — represented by </span><strong>Goldberg Kohn Ltd.</strong><span> (Steven Wickman, Jeremy Downs) and </span><strong>Holland &amp; Knight LLP</strong><span> (Brent McIlwain, Christopher Bailey)  — stalled. They then hired </span><strong>Riveron Consulting LLC</strong><span> (Steven Wybo) as restructuring and financial advisor to assist*** but, alas, the debtors and Fifth Third failed to see eye to eye and the war continued. Luckily in this war, there are no suicide drones. </span></p><p>Yet. </p><p>Upon a read of the first day papers, our Johnny — about a half bottle deep into some Stoli of his own by that point — questioned whether the debtors had Fifth Third’s consent to use cash collateral. It seemed ‘not,’ but he wondered if that might be the vodka impairing his read of the material. The papers seemed strangely vague on the point. </p><p><span>On December 2, 2024, Fifth Third clarified things; it lobbed in a “limited” objection and reservation of rights with respect to the debtors’ cash collateral motion. “</span><em>This is not a case where the parties were aligned on a chapter 11 filing, much less the specifics of cash collateral consent</em><span>,” they say. </span></p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/d9dfded9-373b-4e11-80a4-628951d2ae55?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_352,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec97146-8c40-4d89-8b60-29e2e54ee871_480x366.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>But it may not be as bad as that banger sentence might suggest. Hence the “limited” objection. Fifth Third adds: </p><pre><code><code>“Generally, Lender does not object to the Debtors using cash collateral to maintain their current operations while the parties conduct expedited diligence, discussions and possibly discovery. However, Lender believes that Debtors’ proposed cash collateral use—even on an interim basis—is likely to consume a material amount of Lender’s collateral. The Budget for the proposed interim cash collateral order and related detail shared with Lender since the Petition Date indicate that the Debtors are requesting to spend cash collateral and sell inventory without sufficient replacement collateral for the foreseeable future. Replacement liens and adequate protection claims against Lender’s existing collateral do little to address this; Lender already has prepetition liens on substantially all of the Debtors' assets. The Debtors’ Declaration gives the impression that they should be allowed to impact the collateral this way because Lender is significantly over-secured. The extent of Lender’s equity cushion is speculative at this point, and nothing in the Debtors’ pleadings addresses the end to which they are asking to erode it. Absent a clear showing of adequate protection of Lender’s interests by the Debtors and alignment around an agreeable path forward in these cases (neither of which presently exist), any support from Lender to an interim cash collateral order will likely turn into a contested hearing.”</code></code></pre><p>Or, in short, “f*ck you, pay me” (adequate protection for principal, interest, fees or otherwise). You know who they don’t want to see paid? RX pros, that’s who. </p><pre><code><code>“To be clear, the Lender has not consented and does not consent to a carveout in these cases for the Debtors’ professional fees and expenses, and it does not otherwise consent to the use of cash collateral under an interim order to pay any such amounts. Lender recognizes that carveouts are a typical feature of complex chapter 11 cases, but that is because the vast majority of such cases result in consensual cash collateral or DIP financing arrangements between debtors and lenders – often driven, in large part, by the need for the debtor’s professionals to be assured payment for months’ worth of services.”</code></code></pre><p><span>Hot damn! Lender on RX pro violence, lol!! Did Putin put Goldberg Kohn up to this?! Debtors’ counsel, </span><strong>Foley &amp; Lardner LLP</strong><span> (Holland O’Neil, Stephen Jones, Mary Rofaeil, Zachary Zahn, Ann Marie Uetz, Michael Small), surely loves the prospect of no pro fee carveout, right?

Is it time to cue the Joker-incinerates-cash meme yet? </span></p><p><span>The ratings agencies have been having a field day with this company. And for good cause. Mavenir missed an interest payment in September. On November 22, 2024, </span><strong>Moody’s Ratings </strong><span>downgraded the company’s corporate rated to Caa3 from Caa1 with a matching downgrade for the first lien credit facility; it also changed the company’s outlook from stable to negative. This is a pretty savage summary of the current state of affairs (per Moody’s): </span></p><pre><code><code>“The downgrade … to Caa3 reflects the high risk of default given the company's weak liquidity, specifically very limited cash, revolver capacity or alternate sources of capital. After investing over $1.5 billion, the company's equity sponsors have turned definitely uncommitted to providing any additional capital support, leaving no certain back-stop. This was evident in the recent default when the company missed an interest payment in September. The company continues to burn cash which we estimate to be approximately $45 million quarterly, and has limited liquidity ($21.5 million at the end of Q2 and little to no RCF availability). As a result, the equity sponsors are working to raise bridge financing nearly quarterly to shore up liquidity and provide working capital while seeking to raise longer-term equity capital from new investors. As a result, we project leverage, which is already very high to further increase and the risk of another default to remain very probable if the company and or the equity sponsors fail to raise additional capital to improve the liquidity profile. Likewise, any restructuring of the debt at a discount is likely to be considered a distressed exchange, also considered a default under our definition. Without a material recapitalization, the capital structure is untenable given the very high leverage, weak liquidity profile, and poor operating performance.”</code></code></pre><p>Moody’s doesn’t take kindly to the company’s sponsors: </p><pre><code><code>“Mavenir's credit profile is negatively impacted by governance risk … which reflects highly concentrated ownership with private equity sponsors that are pursuing a very aggressive, venture-capital-like growth strategy in parallel with a core business which produces at least 85% of consolidated revenue. The company spends substantial funds on research and development (near 50% of revenue) for new business opportunities, producing very low profitability, negative free cash flows and very high leverage. This business model requires the sponsors to regularly pre-fund the business with capital including both debt and equity to maintain liquidity.”</code></code></pre><p>Well hot damn. Moody’s is bearish all over the place. Sh*te governance? ✅. Too much R&amp;D? ✅. No scale? ✅. Falling revenues? ✅. High customer concentration? ✅. Limited market share in a “very large market”? ✅. Strained and diminishing liquidity? ✅. Negative EBITDA? ✅. Free cash flow deficits? ✅. Are you still even reading this? ✅. Moody’s doesn’t expect the sponsors to pony up another dime here which means the term lenders have their work cut out from them. Should they expect a good recovery in this situation? Not according to Moody’s: </p><pre><code><code>“We rate the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Caa3 … reflecting a Caa3-PD Probability of Default Rating and our expectation for an average recovery of approximately 50% in a default scenario.”</code></code></pre><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/33dd7bd8-96ca-494b-8a03-0f73f8279aa6?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_320,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab14e924-32ce-437d-abd6-ce61c51bfb24_233x200.gif\"></a><figcaption>Source: GIPHY</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let’s see how this one plays out. </p><h3><strong>📤 Notice📤</strong></h3><h3>🍾Congratulations to…🍾</h3><p><strong>FTI Consulting Inc.</strong><span> (Conor Tully) for securing the financial advisor mandate on behalf of the official committee of unsecured creditors in the </span><strong>Gritstone bio Inc.</strong><span> bankruptcy case. </span></p><p><strong>Proskauer LLP</strong><span> (Brian Rosen, Ehud Barak, Daniel Desatnik, Paul Possinger) and </span><strong>Stinson LLP</strong><span> (Nicholas Zluticky, Zachary Hemenway, Lucas Schneider) for securing the legal mandate on behalf of the “statutory unsecured claimholders’ committee” in the </span><strong>Wellpath Holdings Inc.</strong><span> chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. </span></p><h3><strong>📚Resources📚</strong></h3><p><span>We have compiled a list of a$$-kicking resources on the topics of restructuring, tech, finance, investing, and disruption. 💥</span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/87d94bd3-0be6-49a0-ae96-e4dc42b72ddc?j=eyJ1IjoiOW95azAifQ.3I-y5PDezjo-i0ls31AGTIH4E8sNNl31puiktHvNIm8\">You can find it here</a></strong><span>💥. </span></p></div>",

government built ENIAC, an acronym for <em>E</em>lectronic <em>N</em>umerical <em>I</em>ntegrator <em>a</em>nd <em>C</em>omputer, to do ballistics trajectory calculations for the military; World War 2 was nearing its conclusion, however, so ENIAC’s first major job was to do calculations that undergirded the development of the hydrogen bomb. Six years later, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who led the development of ENIAC, launched UNIVAC, the Universal Automatic Computer, for broader government and commercial applications. Early use cases included calculating the U.S. census and assisting with calculation-intensive back office operations like payroll and bookkeeping.</p>\n<p>These were hardly computers as we know them today, but rather calculation machines that took in reams of data (via punch cards or magnetic tape) and returned results according to hardwired calculation routines; the “operating system” were the humans actually inputting the data, scheduling jobs, and giving explicit hardware instructions. Originally this instruction also happened via punch cards and magnetic tape, but later models added consoles to both provide status and also allow for register-level control; these consoles evolved into terminals, but the first versions of these terminals, like the one that was available for the original version of the IBM System/360, were used to initiate batch programs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-3.png?resize=1024%2C163&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>Any recounting of computing history usually focuses on the bottom two levels of that stack — the device and the input method — because they tend to evolve in parallel. For example, here are the three major computing paradigms to date:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-1.png?resize=1024%2C163&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>These aren’t perfect delineations; the first PCs had terminal-like interfaces, and pre-iPhone smartphones used windows-icons-menus-pointer (WIMP) interaction paradigms, with built-in keyboards and styluses. In the grand scheme of things, though, the distinction is pretty clear, and, by extension, it’s pretty easy to predict what is next:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-2.png?resize=1024%2C163&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>Wearables is an admittedly broad category that includes everything from smart watches to earpieces to glasses, but I think it is a cogent one: the defining characteristic of all of these devices, particularly in contrast to the three previous paradigms, is the absence of a direct mechanical input mechanism; that leaves speech, gestures, and at the most primitive level, thought.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there is good progress being made on on all of these fronts: the quality and speed of voice interaction has increased dramatically over the last few years; camera-intermediated gestures on the Oculus and Vision Pro work well, and Meta’s Orion wristband uses electromyography (EMG) to interpret gestures without any cameras at all. Neuralink is even more incredible: an implant in the brain captures thoughts directly and translates them into actions.</p>\n<p>These paradigms, however, do not exist in isolation. First off, mainframes still exist, and I’m typing this Article on a PC, even if you may consume it on a phone or via a wearable like a set of AirPods. What stands out to me, however, is the top level of the initial stack I illustrated above: the application layer on one paradigm provides the bridge to the next one. This, more than anything, is why generative AI is a big deal in terms of realizing the future.</p>\n<h3>Bridges to the Future</h3>\n<p>I mentioned the seminal IBM System/360 above, which was actually a family of mainframes; the first version was the Model 30, which, as I noted, did batch processing: you would load up a job using punch cards or magnetic tape and execute the job, just like you did with the ENIAC or UNIVAC. Two years later, however, IBM came out with the Model 67 and the TSS/360 operating system: now you could actually interact with a program via the terminal. This represented a new paradigm at the application layer:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-4.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>It is, admittedly, a bit confusing to refer to this new paradigm at the application layer as Applications, but it is the most accurate nomenclature; what differentiated an application from a program was that while the latter was a pre-determined set of actions that ran as a job, the former could be interacted with and amended while running.</p>\n<p>That new application layer, meanwhile, opened up the possibility for an entirely new industry to create those applications, which could run across the entire System/360 family of mainframes. New applications, in turn, drove demand for more convenient access to the computer itself. This ultimately led to the development of the personal computer (PC), which was an individual application platform:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-5.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>Initial PCs operated from a terminal-like text interface, but truly exploded in popularity with the roll-out of the WIMP interface, which was invented by Xerox PARC, commercialized by Apple, and disseminated by Microsoft. The key point in terms of this Article, however, is that Applications came first: the concept created the bridge from mainframes to PCs.</p>\n<p>PCs underwent their own transformation over their two decades of dominance, first in terms of speed and then in form factor, with the rise of laptops. The key innovation at the application layer, however, was the Internet:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-6.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>The Internet differed from traditional applications by virtue of being available on every PC, facilitating communication between PCs, and by being agnostic to the actual device it was accessed on. This, in turn, provided the bridge to the next device paradigm, the smartphone, with its touch interface:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-7.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>I’ve long noted that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/microsofts-mobile-muddle/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE0L21pY3Jvc29mdHMtbW9iaWxlLW11ZGRsZS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczNTc0NTA2MCwiaWF0IjoxNzMzMTUzMDYwLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.nU-k6evfOsoZEKWjOjuUM-gGRvicnUdD0QuNPqpwHu4yq1Bk2K_QcYxWvMhsx52kM3z0MWewaximmfdwgDjS_DCsoDBS90zAk8Grjvv53exnExGTbq_ojxi8zTzLZgXvtMjBa1OFUoKwXf0OcuSrPzKLH2gd-Om__L183FQc6cm77k6o9_tJjSMNDWDTIxFMBRLcyBW2zb6AUW8lvEe_GIgIRMouJrgQ90Ci_Hwj8WL4DfODkb1zuOnYXcJUI0Nyw-buUVH0u0wEI7X4zo1NDIXQZJveCnstSkZs2YsTdAzrZJtKK9qOLfTcudhi30G22jvSAEO8G2274ce2IDXIAA\">Microsoft did not miss mobile</a>; their error was in trying to extend the PC paradigm to mobile. This not only led to a focus on the wrong interface (WIMP via stylus and built-in keyboard), but also an assumption that the application layer, which Windows dominated, would be a key differentiator.</p>\n<p>Apple, famously, figured out the right interface for the smartphone, and built an entirely new operating system around touch. Yes, iOS is based on macOS at a low level, but it was a completely new operating system in a way that Windows Mobile was not; at the same time, because iOS was based on macOS, it was far more capable than smartphone-only alternatives like BlackBerry OS or PalmOS. The key aspect of this capability was that the iPhone could access the <em>real</em> Internet.</p>\n<p>What is funny is that Steve Jobs’ initial announcement of this capability was met with much less enthusiasm than the iPhone’s other two selling points of being a widescreen iPod and a mobile phone:</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/3OlG8bv1?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata\"><img src=\"https://assets.stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-3OlG8bv1.png\"></a></div>\n<p>\n  Today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a wide-screen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. The third is a breakthrough Internet communications device…These are not three separate devices, this is one device, and we are calling iPhone. Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.\n</p>\n<p>I’ve watched that segment hundreds of times, and the audience’s confusion at “Internet communications device” cracks me up every time; in fact, that was the key factor in reinventing the phone, because it was the bridge that linked a device in your pocket to the world of computing writ large, via the Internet. Jobs listed the initial Internet features later on in the keynote:</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://videopress.com/embed/yYR6Pz3q?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata\"><img src=\"https://assets.stratechery.passport.online/assets/vpress-yYR6Pz3q.png\"></a></div>\n<p>\n  Now let’s take a look at an Internet communications device, part of the iPhone. What’s this all about? Well, we’ve got some real breakthroughs here: to start off with, we’ve got rich HTML email on iPhone. The first time, really rich email on a mobile device, and it works with any IMAP or POP email service. You’ve got your favorite mail service, it’ll likely work with it, and it’s rich text email. We wanted the best web browser on our phone, not a baby browser or a WAP browser, a real browser, and we picked the best one in the world: Safari, and we have Safari running on iPhone. It is the first fully-usable HTML browser on a phone. Third, we have Google Maps. Maps, satellite images, directions, and traffic. This is unbelievable, wait until you see it. We have Widgets, starting off with weather and stocks. And, this communicates with the Internet over Edge and Wifi, and iPhone automatically detects Wifi and switches seamless to it. You don’t have to manage the network, it just does the right thing.\n</p>\n<p>Notice that the Internet is not just the web; in fact, while Apple wouldn’t launch a 3rd-party App Store until the following year, it did, with the initial iPhone, launch the app paradigm which, in contrast to standalone Applications from the PC days, assumed and depended on the Internet for functionality.</p>\n<h3>The Generative AI Bridge</h3>\n<p>We already established above that the next paradigm is wearables. Wearables today, however, are very much in the pre-iPhone era. On one hand you have standalone platforms like Oculus, with its own operating system, app store, etc.; the best analogy is a video game console, which is technically a computer, but is not commonly thought of as such given its singular purpose. On the other hand, you have devices like smart watches, AirPods, and smart glasses, which are extensions of the phone; the analogy here is the iPod, which provided great functionality but was not a general computing device.</p>\n<p>Now Apple might dispute this characterization in terms of the Vision Pro specifically, which not only has a PC-class M2 chip, along with its own visionOS operating system and apps, but can also run iPad apps. In truth, though, this makes the Vision Pro akin to Microsoft Mobile: yes, it is a capable device, but it is stuck in the wrong paradigm, i.e. the previous one that Apple dominated. Or, to put it another way, I don’t view “apps” as the bridge between mobile and wearables; apps are just the way we access the Internet on mobile, and the Internet was the old bridge, not the new one.</p>\n<p>To think about the next bridge, it’s useful to jump forward to the future and work backwards; that jump forward is a lot easier to envision, for me anyways, thanks to <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-meta-cto-andrew-bosworth-about-orion-and-reality-labs/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.szFZXUb1J4mswmaZAX3bOWcAxu-XdPylZKnkgUZ8h-j-cmuoRZ-ratz8ItF1-VUJawSY5vqAeRfQwmn7bAj1Ht3XyJftW_I0bp3aEvulUnHRvbCM8VGdIBbwdE5gBDo6VMtkAGAbidcpQi9cVsnCaxjsjd3BDUVmfZ-xGTJk3UrbMCbSg5d_G0Kv6zBmoePMqhyBD8NLOavaoCTR7EaGGiyrGaCHsN7E11QEHIk42plisbIaseAY58Gawgz22l-x99I3nxKxlgGM-NA9kcuw_GupQft-5L4GjYQB_ToHG26A48fI6U1mGLtyrQ3jzUCmLR3nDJR5TAS-9xXWFuPlDw\">my experience</a> with Meta’s Orion AR glasses:</p>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1839065543766429926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1839065543766429926%7Ctwgr%5Efa0ce5ec7db0e8901d885513b57fb2896e93a5a7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fchrome-headless.local%3A9222%2Fatomic\"><img src=\"https://assets.stratechery.passport.online/assets/tweet-1839065543766429926.png\"></a></div>\n<p> </p></div>\n<p>The most impressive aspect of Orion is the resolution, which is perfect.

Orion has perfect field-of-view and infinite resolution because you’re looking at the real world; it’s also dramatically smaller and lighter. Moreover, this perfect fidelity actually gives more degrees of freedom in terms of delivering the AR experience: no matter how high resolution the display is, it will still be lower resolution than the world around it; I tried a version of Orion with double the resolution and, honestly, it wasn’t that different, because the magic was in having augmented reality at all, not in its resolution. I suspect the same thing applies to field of view: 70 degrees seemed massive on Orion, even though that is less than the Vision Pro’s 100 degrees, because the edge of the field of view for Orion was reality, whereas the edge for the Vision Pro is, well, nothing.\n</p>\n<p>The current iteration of Orion’s software did have an Oculus-adjacent launch screen, and an Instagram prototype; it was, in my estimation, the least impressive part of the demonstration, for the same reason that I think the Vision Pro’s iPad app compatibility is a long-term limitation: it was simply taking the mobile paradigm and putting it in front of my face, and honestly, I’d rather just use my phone.</p>\n<p>One of the most impressive demos, meanwhile, had the least UI: it was just a notification. I glanced up, saw that someone was calling me, touched my fingers together to “click” on the accept button that accompanied the notification, and was instantly talking to someone in another room while still being able to interact freely with the world around me. Of course phone calls aren’t some sort of new invention; what made the demo memorable was that I only got the UI I needed when I needed it.</p>\n<p>This, I think, is the future: the exact UI you need — and nothing more — exactly when you need it, and at no time else. This specific example was, of course, programmed deterministically, but you can imagine a future where the glasses are smart enough to generate UI on the fly based on the context of not just your request, but also your broader surroundings and state.</p>\n<p>This is where you start to see the bridge: what I am describing is an application of generative AI, specifically to on-demand UI interfaces. It’s also an application that you can imagine being useful on devices that already exist. A watch application, for example, would be much more usable if, instead of trying to navigate by touch like a small iPhone, it could simply show you the exact choices you need to make at a specific moment in time. Again, we get hints of that today through deterministic programming, but the ultimate application will be on-demand via generative AI.</p>\n<p>Of course generative AI is also usable on the phone, and that is where I expect most of the exploration around generative UI to happen for now. We certainly see plenty of experimentation and rapid development of generative AI broadly, just as we saw plenty of experimentation and rapid development of the Internet on PCs. That experimentation and development was not just usable on the PC, but it also created the bridge to the smartphone; I think that generative AI is doing the same thing in terms of building a bridge to wearables that are not accessories, but general purpose computers in their own right:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p>This is exciting in the long-term, and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/metas-ai-abundance/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L21ldGFzLWFpLWFidW5kYW5jZS8iXX0sImV4cCI6MTczNTc0NTA2MCwiaWF0IjoxNzMzMTUzMDYwLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUvb2F1dGgiLCJzY29wZSI6ImZlZWQ6cmVhZCBhcnRpY2xlOnJlYWQgYXNzZXQ6cmVhZCBjYXRlZ29yeTpyZWFkIGVudGl0bGVtZW50cyIsInN1YiI6IldSQ1hWN041VlZzWlp6ZW5iRWc3SEUiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.u6TOgrYKIRO_EBx0m5oPOD7rl7BIoq9TF6K9uDSrln9ru1aRHo7rTjeqCyv9-RLC3PCecjmlnOFJVg1BJ5hsES_ndn8_bryXKIsfuZuv5Crj1BQ74Uuh_2aJfToyZbT7Tw3Bm8NyKGgAnu9HkG_VgfJpU70mfVlVJPtK08ZPxoekXogvAJlATbpcI1TIvDdUjc-T5s2PG9sKYJl8wdYfz7yLn6YqaLuQn5MW9BNXetd8VPuEsuPmJyqqoSmoVHsb6G-pgLr3HFY1u1GHmW3rjsZfRTl5Uwp_ZGNrbh2oWXLg2oSJe0AGbMpCYQzhS_zLNO3TL1kPCgoPlQLkCRKVOg\">bullish for Meta</a> (and <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2RhbGwtZS10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWFuZC16ZXJvLW1hcmdpbmFsLWNvbnRlbnQvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3MzU3NDUwNjAsImlhdCI6MTczMzE1MzA2MCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.HhxgtVoZ99lTftadlfb3beVCV3b6DiQT-1x2n0-o4MnIaIryCeISUCgaQniJD_RuQJybJ_sCZa-y4wBDA2Nc6kd0isBeIh8FYAsPFnw471eheUFGnDbsokr-9Oh7FJTvtqX7jGhYeYVBDjVE4_hjl_pqmVuGFbKHpwDG2CGrnPYwvFpre_xXTunh4i3tmod0HX0z2Axk3nfAgPq4HaIN2Hk3LmT_GRDi5jzQiBujxEqCF8J3QP9IjaVxwWDzEMzIRwhM5958cM5g7SRgnO10ZgtWwCICppc3CJPCV_VE42WducaV1_ixDNp2u03v2zv1-dYWhRkXpf48zLhjDfs__A\">I’ve previously noted how generative AI is the key to the metaverse, as well</a>). It’s also, clearly, well into the future. It also helps explain why Orion isn’t shipping today: it’s not just that the hardware isn’t yet in a production state, particularly from a cost perspective, but the entire application layer needs to be built out, first on today’s devices, enabling the same sort of smooth transition that the iPhone had. No, Apple didn’t have the App Store, but the iPhone was extraordinarily useful on day one, because it was an Internet Communicator.</p>\n<h3>Survey Complete</h3>\n<p>Ten years ago I wrote a post entitled <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/state-consumer-technology-end-2014/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDE0L3N0YXRlLWNvbnN1bWVyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZW5kLTIwMTQvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3MzU3NDUwNjAsImlhdCI6MTczMzE1MzA2MCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiJXUkNYVjdONVZWc1paemVuYkVnN0hFIiwidXNlIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.BvCYVd_tCZFa1118f7y2pfliy_Dh7VlgIfAWpSPQMNXQDcmM8JsqUk8hJX7i2pJ5C5X4L73oGWWqUdLAOiWOFFpvgB8b5dK6FnlgPCIvmt_TEGSW4-QSi5d36EVs067ORqxE256xRdz-PovXQ1OYmUhAiQB1ZNz2mRIUa1UBd1q3DQ0gQR4IQ7Dj24ErX6weLUlmnMvcucKN_T8kcQlJhRR7vg6srN9S2oQc1Ow25PTdiTeMnS5eQAfgpk5f0tmIaTOfyDHYe_z8eyrA_mLXqG1s90agvPSx16sHgOqKnOw4VjlVzgsgSZURTBtFbdTxuboeTf24c8jxMpy8DI53ZA\">The State of Consumer Technology in 2014</a>, where I explored some of the same paradigm-shifts I detailed in this Article.

Concerns are rising that we may have hit a data wall, and that there won’t be more intelligent AI without new fundamental breakthroughs in AI architecture.</p>\n<p>I, however, feel quite optimistic. To me the story of 2024 has been filling in those question marks in that illustration. The product overhang from the generative AI capabilities we have today are absolutely massive: there are so many new things to be built, and completely new application layer paradigms are at the top of the list. That, by extension, is the bridge that will unlock entirely new paradigms of computing. The road to the future needs to be built; it’s exciting to have the sense that the surveying is now complete.</p>\n\n                                                                            \n

That’s certainly seemed like the case since Richard Feynman and others proposed the idea in the early 1980s. But, we may actually be making some real progress, thanks to hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft dumping billions of dollars into research.</p><p>Now, Microsoft and Atom Computing achieved a major milestone in quantum computing by transitioning from physical to logical qubits using a neutral atom quantum processor. They entangled 24 logical qubits and performed computations on 28, leveraging advanced error-correction techniques to reduce errors—a critical step toward fault-tolerant quantum systems. Error reduction, a concept that always comes up when we write about quantum computing, is so crucial because quantum states are highly fragile, and even small errors can disrupt computations, making reliable, large-scale quantum processing and practical applications impossible without effective error correction.</p><p>This breakthrough from Microsoft and Atom underscores the potential of neutral atom platforms, offering scalability and robust error handling, and positions logical qubits as essential for practical quantum applications. And if we can unlock practical quantum computing, that means major breakthroughs in drug discovery, cryptography, materials design, and really any kind of super complex modeling. </p><p><span>If you believe that the </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/6162d9d2-0142-44e4-8520-20a6d559dfcc?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">brain is a quantum processor</a><span>, it may even bring us one step closer to true ASI. </span></p><p><em>Elizabeth Gibney for Nature</em></p><blockquote><p><em>PsiQuantum has ambitious goals to build a useful quantum machine by late 2027 — and has raised more than US$1 billion to do it.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/fd5d9abf-3d95-44b5-8fa4-b92016c6c5be?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1534,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272de84e-4f19-4fa5-b389-44364955b987_767x737.jpeg\"></a></figure></div><p>Ten years away from being ten years away? Ψuck that!</p><p>PsiQuantum raised over $1 billion to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2027.</p><p>To achieve that aggressive timeline, PsiQuantum is burning the boats. Unlike its competitors, it’s skipping small prototypes and aiming straight for a million-qubit quantum computer. All or nothing, baby!</p><p>PsiQuantum’s approach leverages photonic qubits—particles of light—manipulated within silicon chips. In doing so, the company can utilize existing semiconductor and photonics technologies to enable scalable, fault-tolerant systems, bypassing many of the noise and stability (it always comes back to error reduction!) challenges faced by other quantum platforms. If their bet pays off, it may allow them to leapfrog major quantum players like Google, Microsoft, and IBM. </p><p>Now that would be a quantum leap! (sorry, tryptophan…) </p><p><em>From Nabla Bio</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Today, we’re thrilled to share a major advance in our ability to design antibodies fully computationally. We developed a new AI protein design system, JAM, capable of designing high quality lead antibodies de novo given just a target protein sequence and/or structure.</em></p></blockquote><p>Nabla Bio, a biotech startup, unveiled Joint Atomic Modeling (JAM), an AI-based platform capable of designing antibodies from scratch using only a target protein’s sequence or structure. JAM can create antibodies for tough-to-target proteins, like GPCRs, which are important for making new medicines but are hard to work with using older methods. </p><p>As a quick reminder, an antibody is a protein made by your immune system that helps fight infections. It recognizes and binds to harmful invaders like bacteria or viruses, marking them for destruction or blocking their ability to cause harm. Today, finding new antibodies involves a slow, expensive process of trial-and-error, typically using lab testing on cells or animals to identify and optimize molecules that bind to specific disease targets. JAM’s AI-first approach could speed up finding new antibodies, make the process cheaper, and help treat more diseases.</p><p><em>Steve Bradt for MIT News</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting next fall, thanks to newly expanded financial aid.

MIT has long had financial aid programs that made attending the university accessible for most of the country’s brightest, young math and science minds. With this announcement, 80% of U.S. families are eligible for free MIT tuition. This year alone, the university has allocated nearly $170M to need-based financial aid, which means that 87% of students will graduate debt free.</p><p><span>We have a lot of hard, technical problems left to solve and we need the very best and brightest, from every socioeconomic background, to work on solving them.

Republican or Democrat, you should want your government to work both harder and smarter for you, for your tax dollars to go a bit further, and for there to be less unnecessary red tape.</p><p>We’re excited about what DOGE is going to do on this front: auditing and slashing costs, bringing government workers back to the office, and reducing unnecessary regulations. We think this will have a real, tangible impact on how well the government serves its people. The symbolic impact, however, may have an even larger impact: if DOGE can make efficiency a winning political value proposition, then you are going to see leaders from both sides of the aisle adopt it. You may even start to see politicians competing over, and then bragging on X about, who can be the most efficient. </p><p><span>Democratic Pennsylvanian Governor Josh Shapiro is already starting. Shapiro has been on the efficiency train since before it was cool — his </span><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/7bf0d828-e2fb-4f2c-baac-1bdc8c45aa99?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">record-breaking 1-95 reconstruction</a><span> put him on the map — and now he’s really leaning into it. That’ll force other Democrats to do the same.</span></p><p>And that’s a good thing for Americans. Efficiency should not be the end goal here. Ultimately, we’ll want not just an efficient government but an effective one, too. But in order to get there, there’s some fat that needs to be trimmed. The government cannot be effective until it is efficient.</p><p>Let’s Make Government Efficient Again! And I say that in the least partisan way possible.</p><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/08cdd6ba-f130-4f19-92da-406cfcdf911b?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/EvnJhwIwqds\"></a><p>Today is Black Friday, the most commercial day of the year. Many of you will be making a purchase from Apple today, and some of you will even be purchasing AirPods. I know this, you know this, and Apple certainly knows this. </p><p>Ahead of today, a nakedly commercial day, Apple dropped one of the more emotional ads I’ve ever seen to feature the AirPods new hearing aid feature. They know how to balance commercial marketing and emotional marketing better than just about any company in the world. And with this new ad, they nailed it. </p><p>Apple's AirPods Pro 2 now include a hearing aid feature that lets users take a hearing test and customize sound settings for better listening. It's designed for those with mild to moderate hearing loss, making it easier to hear in different environments.</p><p>The feature isn’t just an excuse for a heartstrings commercial either. About 60% of the US population over 70 years old has mild-to-moderate hearing loss. It’s a pretty massive market opportunity — it’s not hard to imagine the 20M Americans that fit that description to not only upgrade to the newest AirPods, but also spend an increasing amount of time with those AirPods in. Whether that’s a good thing I think is still pretty TBD. Our relationship with Apple is a confusing one, but boy do they know how to put out an ad that makes you feel something.</p><p>Have a great weekend y’all.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><strong><a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/bfaa79ed-8585-4013-b02e-26d88ab1468f?j=eyJ1IjoiOXAwZ3QifQ.gb8J5T7GnA_ZlNuaMZjmlXXepKbqOsa8-6m8ExkRNpU\">Baseten</a></strong><span> for sponsoring!
