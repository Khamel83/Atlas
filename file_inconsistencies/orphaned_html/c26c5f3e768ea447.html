A sense of stubbornness, a singularity of vision, the willingness to be misunderstood.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But perhaps most of all, it requires patience. All four of this year’s Greats — the artists Theaster Gates and Lorna Simpson, the fashion designer Jonathan Anderson and the musician Florence Welch — found early success according to one metric or another. But it wasn’t until later, sometimes years later, that their work started not just being seen or heard or worn but understood. Our impulse is always to view new talent in relation to their predecessors and forebears — that’s the way art history works. But critics (and audiences) can be slow to admit when something is actually sui generis.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sometimes this is because of age-old reasons: sexism and racism. Simpson, whose work spans many genres, recalls presenting her 1985 graduate-school project to the thesis board — “Gestures and Reenactments,” six photographs of an unnamed Black male model paired with her now-signature gnomic pronouncements — and being greeted with silence. They didn’t fail her but, she says, “It taught me I just have to persevere with my own agenda, and I don’t need to be in conversation.” Or look at Welch, whose first, transformative album with her band Florence and the Machine, “Lungs” (2009), confounded many critics, who, the novelist Lauren Groff writes in her profile of the singer-songwriter, “struggled to place her,” comparing her to other artists whose sounds didn’t really resemble hers but who were, after all, women.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But sometimes the artist stands alone because what they’re doing has no modern or popular precedent. Think of Gates: a truly uncategorizable artist who early in his career was an arts administrator at the University of Chicago and whose work now comprises real estate, performance, sculpture and, most passionately, ceramics. Or consider Anderson, whose restless curiosity makes us rethink what clothes are — nothing so simple or straightforward as sexy or wearable, his fashion challenges the point of fashion itself.

When we met for the first time, in May at his studio in Chicago’s Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood, he had just returned from opening exhibitions at the <a href="https://www.mori.art.museum/en/exhibitions/theastergates/">Mori Art Museum</a> in Tokyo and the <a href="https://camh.org/event/theaster-gates-the-gift-and-the-renege/">Contemporary Arts Museum Houston</a>. His practice is all-encompassing. He is known for installations that use supplies and furnishings from old buildings, paying tribute to their past lives — as homes, stores, churches. These installations serve double or even triple duty: They are works of art in themselves, but they can also become venues for parties or performances. His sculptures and paintings employ construction materials like wood, rubber and roofing tar. He’s a master ceramist and a musician and singer who performs with his experimental group, the Black Monks, in which he’s known as the Abbot.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For years, Gates has acquired archives, and he sees their stewardship as integral to his work. Many preserve Black American cultural memory, like the roughly 20,000-volume library that once belonged to the Johnson Publishing Company, publisher of Ebony and Jet, and the 5,000-record vinyl collection of Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago D.J. at whose late ’70s parties house music was born. He is currently advising an arts-led redevelopment project in Philadelphia and an initiative to preserve Houston’s Freedmen’s Town, a historically Black district in the city’s Fourth Ward. He chairs the diversity council at Prada, where he runs a mentorship program for designers of color, and he is developing partnerships in Japan with small family-owned businesses to produce incense and sake. In his studio, a 30,000-square-foot compound that occupies two former factories that he bought in 2019, he served me tea from Horii Shichimeien, a venerable Kyoto maker, in a stoneware cup.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7" style="" aria-label="video">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-hidden="true">   <script src="https://static01.nyt.com/video-static/vhs3/vhs.min.js"></script> <div class="g-vhs-video svelte-rohdkl"></div></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The artist discusses the ceramics of the Japanese craftsman Shiro Tsujimura, whose work he sees as setting a high standard for his own pottery.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Video by Jon Henry<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In his hometown, Gates is recognized as an entrepreneur who buys and restores properties on Chicago’s South Side. He puts these properties to unusual, sometimes less than practical use. The core of his holdings is a quiet half-mile stretch of South Dorchester Avenue, where he started acquiring run-down houses in 2006. He filled some with archives — thousands of art books purchased from a shuttered bookshop; LPs from a defunct record store. One house became his residence.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates’s business dealings and art making are not at odds: Salvage from the buildings goes into his art installations; proceeds from his art sales fund his building renovations and community programs. But they also stem from shared soil — his upbringing as the son of a roofer on Chicago’s West Side, his training as an urban planner — and commingle in his projects to the point where it would be artificial to separate them. Gates himself draws no distinction: He hopes to demonstrate, he told me, “an open model for what an artist can be.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates took a highly unusual path into the art world and, as an artist, though inspired by multiple movements and histories, he’s created something sui generis. He rebuffs categories like “social practice” — jargon for participative art with civic goals — but cites predecessors like Donald Judd, who made furniture as well as geometric objects, and the Fluxus movement, with its interest in everyday materials and spontaneous performances. He’s an inheritor of the legacy of Marcel Duchamp and his readymades, mass-produced and utilitarian objects that the French artist displayed as art. In a sense, Gates has scaled up the method. Duchamp’s readymades include a snow shovel and a bicycle wheel; Gates’s are old factories and homes. To some extent, he doesn’t think of them as property at all. “The beauty of these buildings gives me a tremendous amount of joy,” he said. “It’s an artistic idiom of its own.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-slideshow-wrapper svelte-xzcuaq" data-id="100000009750314"><div class="g-slideshow-viewer svelte-xzcuaq"><button class="prev svelte-xzcuaq" style="display: none;" data-svelte-h="svelte-7qwb7w"><img src="https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2024-09-27-tmag-greats/b2a0c71a-d1c2-47fb-ae32-7d568437bc5c/_assets/prev.svg"></button> <button class="next svelte-xzcuaq" style="display: none;" data-svelte-h="svelte-1empjig"><img src="https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2024-09-27-tmag-greats/b2a0c71a-d1c2-47fb-ae32-7d568437bc5c/_assets/next.svg"></button> <swiper-container style="--swiper-navigation-color: #fff;

After that, he began investing in Grand Crossing when he moved to the South Side to become an arts administrator at the University of Chicago, where he’s now a professor. “The neighborhood had stigma, but the people were great and interesting,” he said. He recognized the terrain: Black neighborhoods that faced disinvestment and crime but were once self-contained and self-possessed — places where, he said, “the Black doctor and lawyer and bus driver and maid were all on the same block, and they all went to the same church.” By revitalizing these quotidian spaces — homes, a bank, a school, hardware stores that he has bought, often with their contents, when they were going out of business — he is summoning a kind of utopian memory in the service of new functions. “It’s not just the bourgeois dimension of ‘He owns a building,’” Gates’s friend the artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa, 63, told me. “It’s more about a transgression of some primary interdictions with regard to Black people, which is that you cannot manage material. You will be material. But to manage material is a whole other thing.” Through his investments in Grand Crossing — even when they take unconventional forms — Gates sees himself as helping Chicago to “hold its Black self together.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid19" class="place-ad" data-position="mid19" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->He took me down a side street edged by commuter rail tracks where in 2021 he opened Kenwood Gardens, a sanctuary with lawns, wildflowers and a pavilion that hosts house-music parties in the summer. It occupies 13 lots that were in decline — notorious, he said, for burned-out cars and prostitution. A wall encircling the garden is made partly from bricks that he saved from St. Laurence Catholic Church, a neighborhood anchor that the archdiocese sold and that was razed in 2014.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“When I built the perimeter wall, I didn’t own the property,” Gates said. “I built the wall to stop the bad stuff.” He then bought the lots, many loaded with tax arrears. “The city was quite happy to help us negotiate the land sales,” he said, “because they would finally have a steward.” Building his unauthorized wall, Gates said, was a case of tactical urbanism, as citizen initiatives that bypass city bureaucracy or goad it to action are called in the planning business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates is compact, with a shaved head and salt-and-pepper beard, and he dresses comfortably in collarless shirts, loose pants and leather loafers. When he gets excited about a topic, he can take on the tone of a minister addressing his congregation. He is too obviously sincere, even earnest, to come across as an operator. And yet he has both an aptitude and an appetite for policy and negotiations. In a famous deal, he purchased the former Stony Island State Savings Bank, a 1920s edifice facing demolition, from the city in 2012 for $1 and the commitment to restore it — which he funded in part by selling salvaged marble slabs at Art Basel for $5,000 each. It now hosts collections, exhibitions and events. “You learn policy, you know the rules, you play with it,” he said. “Then you can make a case.” Romi Crawford, 58, a professor of visual and critical studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, described how Gates enfolds transactions into his art as “contract aesthetics.” Gates has fielded periodic criticism that he is too amenable to the rich and powerful. He rejects this, returning to the word “tactical.” “If you’re talking about protesting, there are people who are better protesters,” he said. “If you’re talking about getting [things] done in the city, I can do it better than most artists. I can do it better than most developers.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We arrived at the bank building. Outside was the gazebo where the 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014; working with Rice’s mother, Gates brought the structure to Chicago to save it from demolition. (It belongs back in Cleveland, he’s said, but its temporary care is his “duty as a Black man,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/22/tamir-rice-killed-police-theaster-gates-black-artist-gazebo">he told the Guardian in 2019</a>.) Inside the bank some 50 people had gathered for happy hour — including Frederick Dunson, the president of the Frankie Knuckles Foundation; Yaw Agyeman, one of the Black Monks, who performed with the musician Sharon Udoh; and the D.J. Celeste Alexander, a house-music veteran.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates greeted the assembled in his preacher mode. “I was telling the sisters in the congregation, ‘I want to be free from the things that hinder me,’” he said. He likes his gatherings “underprogrammed,” like his buildings. “There is absolutely no agenda,” he continued. All he wanted was someplace “where we can just be together.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A painting with the text &quot;we will save ourselves&quot; in a gallery space." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1200" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A painting with the text &quot;we will save ourselves&quot; in a gallery space." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1200" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-P4W9-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“We Will Save Ourselves” (2024), one of the artist’s paintings made with roofing materials and recently on view at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->© Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and Theaster Gates Studio.

He still lives on the South Side, although now in an apartment closer to Hyde Park. He travels constantly. He has never married or had children, but he is in a relationship that he and his partner prefer to keep out of the spotlight. “I have love in my life and I’m extremely happy,” he said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->He was born in 1973, the sole boy after eight girls. He describes a close and dense family life in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side shaped by the labor and small property acquisitions of his father, Theaster Gates Sr., and by the devout values of his mother, Lorine, a schoolteacher. His parents had bought their four-apartment home amid late ’60s white flight for $23,000, paying installments to the seller, who eventually forgave the balance.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates toggled between worlds, as he has done ever since. He was bused to the North Side starting in fifth grade, then attended Lane Tech, a selective public high school; in that respect, he told me, “I’m a child of integration and affirmative action.” In the neighborhood, he said, “every summer, more of my friends were in gangs.” He was different: churchy, charismatic, coddled by his big sisters. In lieu of an allowance, his father paid him to help on roofing jobs and fixing buildings. “I was around serial entrepreneurship and prayerful way-making,” Gates told me. “It wasn’t a way to get rich. It was a way to look out for your family and have control of the emotional environment, not have an outside force telling you what to do.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Summers in Mississippi reinforced that idea. In a classic Great Migration pattern, his parents had come up from the Delta — his father from Yazoo City, his mother from Humphreys County nearby. Most of her siblings remained there, and Gates would spend summers with his uncle Herbert, who owned a 500-acre farm, growing corn, cotton and soy beans and raising cattle and hogs. It was an education in the land and its stakes: Other Black families lived on the farm — “The only word we have for it is ‘sharecroppers,’” Gates said — and the surrounding white farmers were trying to squeeze Herbert out. Mississippi, Gates said, is where he learned to appreciate scale: “I understand square blocks because I understand acres.” It’s also a recurring reference in his art. For <a href="https://www.msmuseumart.org/the-great-migration/">a 2022 exhibition</a> of contemporary takes on the Great Migration at the Mississippi Museum of Art, he designed an installation called “Double Wide” inspired by the trailer on his uncle’s land that was a candy store by day and a juke joint after dark.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Arriving at Iowa State University in 1992, Gates decided to major in urban planning (in which he’d later earn a master’s degree) with a double minor in studio art and religious studies. He learned about nonconformists like Samuel Mockbee, the architect who in 1993 co-founded the Rural Studio program, known for designing homes from recycled materials in the Alabama Black Belt. On the side, he discovered pottery, becoming close with a ceramics professor, Ingrid Lilligren, who would remain a mentor.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->After college, Gates won a scholarship to study for a master’s degree in traditional African religion at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Then, following a brief stint in Seattle, he returned to Chicago in 1999 when he was hired by the transit authority. After hours, he’d rent kilns at the Lillstreet Art Center. He wanted, he said, to become good at something. “I went to my day job, and I would come home, go to the studio and make pots,” he said. “That unromantic development was very helpful for me. I was gaining skill in darkness, with no one interested.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once, he recalled, he made three soda-fired bowls to sell at the DuSable Museum’s market devoted to Black artisans. A customer offered $75, less than Gates thought they were worth in view of his costs, leading to an epiphany. “I decided I would no longer sell the vessel,” he said. “If you believe in my world, then you might get a vessel free. But believing in my world is a greater investment than the cost of a bowl.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In 2004, Gates took an unpaid leave and traveled to Japan to attend a summer workshop in Tokoname, a coastal city in the central region and one of the country’s designated Six Ancient Kiln towns, with a nearly thousand-year ceramics history. He lived with a host family and learned from master potters. “I wouldn’t call it instruction, though instruction was part of it,” he said. “I got something more akin to what the Bible would call impartation, where it felt like I was touched or moved.” He added: “It was permission to be a better potter, and that’s really what I needed.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the United States, his instruction on ceramics history had privileged European and American decorative arts. Japan, to which he’d return many times, presented a rich ceramics tradition. He was particularly interested in the Mingei movement, which started in the 1920s and celebrated the beauty of everyday craft objects and advocated support for folk artisans, joining Buddhist precepts with a critique of industrial mass production. The potters Kanjiro Kawai and Shoji Hamada, who were key Mingei figures, embraced solid, rustic forms, local clays and natural glazes, and welcomed imperfections in the finished work.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->All of this gave Gates an idea that would prove pivotal for his own development as an artist. What if, he imagined, following World War II, a Japanese potter had found his way to the United States and landed in Mississippi, drawn to its soil and possibilities? What if he had married a Black woman there, perhaps a civil rights activist? What if, years later, they had died in a crash, leaving behind his body of work?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At his first major exhibition, at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago in 2007, Gates served a soul food dinner for 50 on his stoneware plates that he attributed to the potter, whom he named Shoji Yamaguchi in tribute to Hamada. The guests were a mix of wealthy Chicagoans, artists, South Side neighbors. He hired a biracial actor to play Yamaguchi’s son. Only later would Gates reveal that the work was his own.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gates’s friend Hamza Walker, 58, the director of the alternative art space the Brick in Los Angeles who was living in Chicago at the time, told me that back then Gates called himself a “confused potter-performer.” But if anything, the show, titled “Plate Convergence,” proved his seriousness about ceramics. And it revealed Gates, suddenly, as a full-fledged conceptual artist, not averse to a little sleight of hand. Yet far from a gimmick, the story of Yamaguchi would blossom into a larger synthesis of Black and Japanese folk aesthetics that he now calls Afro-Mingei. “I imagined Yamaguchi as a speculative theory,” Gates told me. Afro-Mingei, he added, “has been a self-fulfilling proposition.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A wooden shoe shine stand in a gallery." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2405" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A wooden shoe shine stand in a gallery." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2405" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-RFDP-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Shoe Shine Stand” (2012) is part of a series of sculptures featuring materials sourced from abandoned homes that Gates purchased on the South Side of Chicago.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Courtesy of Theaster Gates Studio<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><div class="g-heading3-wrapper g-theme-news svelte-yxbget" style="--g-heading3-text-align: left;--g-heading3-margin-left: 0"><h3 class="g-heading3 g-heading3block svelte-yxbget"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->THE HOST<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->THIS PAST JULY, I met Gates in Arles, France, where he’d organized the Black Artists Retreat, a gathering that he has hosted annually at various venues since 2013, and that overlapped this year with his exhibition at LUMA Arles, a sprawling art complex in a former railway yard.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In its early years, BAR, held at Gates’s studio in Chicago, was a chance for established and rising, mostly Black American, artists to connect more or less privately. It grew and eventually traveled — to the Park Avenue Armory in New York for a large, semipublic edition in 2019, and to the Serpentine Pavilion in London in 2022. But in Arles it tacked small again, with some 40-odd artists. Most were European, recommended by the London-based curators Jareh Das and Bianca A. Manu; several barely knew Gates at all. His underprogrammed spirit was back: loose scheduling, good meals, dancing. The French Ghanaian artist Eden Tinto Collins, attending BAR for the first time, told me the vibe felt like “<em>faire foyer</em>” — creating a hearth or home.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At LUMA, Gates had set up a pottery workshop where he and a small team were making works in public to exhibit on-site — a kind of accumulative installation that would fill the hangarlike space by the show’s closing in early November. They included tall, urnlike vessels and abstract, almost gnomic clay works. “It’s very ancestral,” the Nigerian artist Ranti Bam, 42, said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Maja Hoffmann, 68, the Swiss contemporary-art collector and LUMA’s founder, had invested in two kilns — including an <em>anagama</em> (a Japanese “cave kiln”), hand-built on the grounds of La Chassagnette, the restaurant that she owns in the countryside. There, at rosé hour, Gates gathered his guests to witness him unloading the anagama after its inaugural, seven-day-long firing. The kiln, 20 feet deep with an arched fire mouth, resembled a brick dragon. Gates, in blue workwear, sang a gospel tune as pots of various shapes came out, glazed by the ash in ocher, gray and green hues: “You who are weary, stop by the potter’s house. … The potter wants to put you back together again.” There were broken shards, too, which he extracted with equal reverence.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid20" class="place-ad" data-position="mid20" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->During the early years of Gates’s rise, his ceramics were largely unknown, eclipsed by his property acquisitions and works like “Civil Tapestries” — wall-mounted sculptures made from strips of decommissioned fire hoses — and his so-called tar paintings, created from roofing materials in homage to his father. Hoffmann, now a major patron, met him in 2013 at Art Basel, around his installation of a sloping wood surface covered with tar. “I saw him more as a carpenter, a roofer,” she told me. “I didn’t realize the ceramics thing. And then we went to Chicago and I understood.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In fact, he had been making ceramics all along, including in his own anagama in Chicago. At his studio there, Gates had shown me rooms of ceramics and pointed out techniques — cobalt-and-red iron shino glazes, mustard washes, manganese stains. There were vessels and abstract sculptures, utilitarian black bricks and even figurative warrior protectors inspired by African statuary. His recent exhibitions have increasingly featured pottery. “<a href="https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2020/theaster-gates-black-vessel/">Black Vessel</a>,” at Gagosian gallery in New York in 2020, included a room of ceramics, many set directly on the floor. His 2022 New Museum survey in New York, “<a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/theaster-gates-young-lords-and-their-traces">Young Lords and Their Traces</a>,” whose signal theme was mourning — for his mother and father, and for his friends the curator Okwui Enwezor and the writer bell hooks — made space for a large display of ceramics, as well.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->His first craft, Gates suggested, had forced him to work with rigor at times when his career felt too permissive. “After you get to a certain point of ascendancy in the art world, you’re just making up your own truth,” he said. “You don’t have the burden of people even liking you. You’re entering a free fall.” He added: “I’m after a world of rules. I want somebody to say, ‘Your tea bowl is too heavy, Theaster. You can trim a little bit more off the foot. It doesn’t have the depth and dimension that it should. Keep working.’”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-full svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="Long shelves displaying ceramics." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/523" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Long shelves displaying ceramics." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="523" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-F4B2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As part of a recent solo exhibition at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, Gates displayed nearly the entire archive of surviving works by Yoshihiro Koide, a potter from the city of Tokoname, which is known for its master ceramicists.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Courtesy of Theaster Gates Studio.

We were on the mezzanine of Farmoon, a tea salon and chef’s table on a side street in Kyoto. It was hot out, and the chef Masayo Funakoshi had sent up corn ice cream with tomato-infused orange blossom water, ricotta and lemon basil. Funakoshi had cooked a meal at BAR in Arles with the chef Armand Arnal; now she was preparing sweets for a tea ceremony to be held the next day inside Gates’s exhibition in Tokyo and led by Reijiro Izumi, an heir of the centuries-old Urasenke tea ceremony tradition. For the show, Gates also commissioned 30,000 bricks from the Mizuno Seitoen Lab, a company in Tokoname, plus sake from a Kyoto-based company.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We took the Shinkansen train to Nagoya, then drove to Tokoname on the Chita Peninsula. In the Meiji era, the town’s ceramics tradition, its robust high-iron-content clay and harbor location had made it a manufacturing hub for earthenware sewer pipes. But the transition to industrially manufactured metal pipes undercut Tokoname’s clay-based economy. Craft ceramics, however, endured.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The town gave off an air of permanent quiet. “When I go back to Tokoname, it’s like going back to the West Side of Chicago,” Gates said. “What’s there for me are memories and ghosts. Places that used to be open. Clay supply stores. People’s studios that, when you walk along the pottery path, you could just stop in and say hello.” Japan’s aging population has meant fewer successors and more empty workshops. “In a place that’s as culturally significant as Tokoname, there’s a need for a kind of cultural infrastructure,” he said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Not long ago, Gates took over a seven-building compound in town and, in 2022, as part of the Aichi Triennale, he welcomed visitors to a listening room there. “I didn’t want to bring pots to Tokoname; that would be like bringing sand to the beach,” he said. “So I decided to bring my other wheels” — turntables, plus the record collection of Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly, the Chicago potter who died in 2012. “She always wanted to go to Japan,” he said. “And so I brought her albums so that she could be here with me.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Driving up the hill, Gates spotted a neighbor, Mr. Matsushita, 66, a bonsai artist and potter, shirtless in the window of his ground-floor study. He invited us in. Around his desk were his plants and writings, along with old fliers for exhibitions involving the German social-sculpture artist Joseph Beuys.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="Various large black pots in a gallery space." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2699" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Various large black pots in a gallery space." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2699" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A/17tmag-gates-artwork-slide-CH2A-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some of Gates’s own stoneware pots, on view in an installation called “Doric Temple” in a 2022 solo show at the New Museum in New York.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Courtesy of Theaster Gates Studio.

That’s a beautiful thing.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Through a back door lay a vast ceramics workshop with two kilns. “In Tokoname there’s no wind,” Matshushita said. “For me, Theaster brings the wind.” He added, “It’s not easy to live freely like Theaster.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Tokyo at the Mori Art Museum, wall text by Gates explained that Afro-Mingei was “a speculation.” In Mingei’s assertion of pride in folk craft, Gates recognized an impulse that felt similar to the Black Is Beautiful movement of the 1960s and ’70s. But the show was also his expression of thanks for Japan and its potters. “I’m a different artist in Japan,” he told me. “And I love myself here.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The exhibition mixed familiar forms from Gates’s repertoire — ceramics, tar paintings, salvaged-wood installations — with neon sculptures and slate boards marked with names of Black and Japanese artists and movements. There were shelves laden with thousands of small sake jars. Most strikingly, on racks of wooden shelving he’d placed one of his readymade archives — almost the entire body of work that Yoshihiro Koide, a Tokoname potter, left behind at his death in 2022. The nearly 20,000 ceramic pieces, many wrapped in paper or contained in boxes, were a monument to labor and to the duty of care.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The exhibition’s organizers, Mami Kataoka and Hirokazu Tokuyama, had wanted to show a selection of these works in vitrines, Gates said. He insisted otherwise. “They were being museological,” he said. “I was being propagandistic. I’m trying to show you a world, and you can’t show a world through four objects, or taking the best specimens and presenting them. If you want to have a Theaster show, you bring all 20,000 things.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But despite the busy world Gates has built for himself, its center is paradoxically calm. At the studio in Chicago, I’d been struck by the quiet. His operation has downsized, he said — from 65 employees at its peak, around 2016, which he admitted overwhelmed him, to just 15.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Next to go might be his collection of buildings, though it could take a while. “I did not attempt to amass a real estate holdings situation,” he said. “I was simply trying to prove the point that artists can change a place.” Now, he added, “I have to learn how to shed. In the same way that I spent two decades accumulating, I feel like I’m going to spend two decades shrinking.” At that point, he fantasized, we might find him in Kenwood Gardens, giving tea bowls away.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“As a 30-year-old, buying a building meant something,” he said. “It meant, ‘I’m a man, I’m a mature person, I can stand on my own feet.’ The second building was like, ‘I can have a studio, I can contribute to a block, I can be useful to my people.’ Now I can be useful by giving it away. I don’t need any footprint.” The goal for the next stage of his career, he said, “will be that no one needs me anymore.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p> </div> </article><article id="welch" class="svelte-1jpygiz"><div id="17tmag-welch"><div class="g-greats-header svelte-7xfxiv"><div class="g-greats-header-inner svelte-7xfxiv"><div class="g-greats-header-art svelte-7xfxiv"><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A black and white image of Florence Welch wearing a long dress." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1789/2250" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 894.5px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 815px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 816px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A black and white image of Florence Welch wearing a long dress." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1789" height="2250" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-R056-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The musician Florence Welch, photographed in London on July 5, 2024. <strong>Valentino</strong> dress, price on request, (212) 772-6969; and Welch’s own shawl and jewelry.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

When I rang the Camberwell, South London, doorbell of Florence Welch, I held a tribute: “The Penguin Book of Spiritual Verse” (2022), edited by Kaveh Akbar. It has a poem in it by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/arts/enheduanna-author-morgan.html">Enheduanna</a>, the first named poet in written historical records, a Sumerian princess and priestess who lived over 4,000 years ago. Ancient priestesses made their bodies a conduit for collective transcendence and, now that the old gods have abandoned us, we secular souls tend to find our collective transcendence at concerts. I’ve never seen Welch’s band, Florence and the Machine, perform live, only on YouTube, I’ve only heard her music streaming on repeat for years, and yet I often find myself carried out of my body by Welch’s enormous voice, her rage and power. There’s a sizzling line that starts with Enheduanna and runs all the way to Welch; they’re both performers of spiritual enormity who, through incantation of words, open a channel to vast mysteries.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What was I expecting? Impossibilities. A modern Madame Blavatsky all dressed in gauze, trembling shadows, eyes like dark whirlpools. Instead, on that July day, after her assistant let me in, Welch ran up from her garden a creature of flesh and blood, wearing a prim prairie dress with flowers speckled all over it. She is tall — somewhere near 5-foot-10 — ardent and elegant, with long red Pre-Raphaelite hair and the strong-boned face of a medieval saint. She has an incredible vigor to her speech, which is frequently crowded with images. She was talking even before coming into the room and spoke nonstop for hours, thoughtfully, in loops and circuits; I only interjected a few times. With other people, being monologued at like this might have been hellish, but Welch was a little goofy, quite funny — her laugh is deep, sudden, frequent and startlingly loud. On multiple occasions during our hours together, she paced in excitement. Once she sped off upstairs to fetch something, coming down the staircase with such fast footsteps that I was briefly afraid she’d tumble the rest of the way.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Poems!” said Welch, flipping through the book I brought. “Great!” And then in a flash the book vanished, never to be seen again.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7" style="" aria-label="video">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-hidden="true">    <div class="g-vhs-video svelte-rohdkl"></div></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The singer on the Fleetwood Mac song that feels like riding a roller coaster.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Video by Jerome Monnot<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In fairness, a single book would be easily lost among the stuffed bookshelves everywhere in her house. Welch is a real reader: She presides over a book club called Between Two Books and, in full disclosure, drew from my 2018 short story collection, “Florida,” when she was writing lyrics for the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEssK8o3jKg">Florida!!!</a>,” her 2024 collaboration with Taylor Swift. Her rooms replicate her maximalist, ecstatic music: high ceilings; many paintings and drawings; thick woolen Oriental rugs. Everything is layered and made of complex patterns, with William Morris prints and hand-marbled boxes in intense colors like peacock blue, goldenrod, raspberry sorbet.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Because the best way is often straight through, I tried to start our conversation with a question about mysticism, but she refused to be boxed in. She said, laughing, that she can read tarot, but she refused to define her spirituality, beyond repeating a quip of her mother, Evelyn Welch’s, a Renaissance expert and currently the vice chancellor of the University of Bristol, who called her daughter “an animist.” Maybe she meant that, to her daughter, things like sunlight and the ocean have a soul. Welch’s earliest spiritual moment came when she was an imaginative small child in Camberwell — where her parents lived, not far from her current house — just looking at beams of light coming through her bedroom window and feeling connected to something larger.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="Florence Welch, barefooted, jumps in the air.

It allows her to change and grow in public. But it’s an equal source of confusion to critics, who’ve struggled to place her since the first of her five albums, 2009’s “Lungs.” Of course, no artist is truly sui generis — art is built out of other art — but it’s odd that Welch so confounds critics with her mix of soul and goth-punk and ethereal power ballads, as well as the way that she presents herself as closer kin to 1960s rock goddesses than to the hyperproduced pop stars of today, that the aforementioned critics have only rarely likened her to the musicians who’ve been her truest influences. Among these are Nick Cave, Patti Smith, Stevie Nicks, Tom Waits, Jeff Buckley, Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, whose live version of 1967’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ9n2_5mbig">Try a Little Tenderness</a>” Welch watched obsessively on YouTube in her early 20s when she was teaching herself how to perform, his energy building as the song goes until, she said, “he just tears the stage apart.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Perhaps it’s enough to say that Welch has one of the most distinctively powerful voices in popular music. My friend the 33-year-old performer Ganavya Doraiswamy, who’s trained in both jazz and South Asian devotional singing — the only other person I’ve ever met with a voice whose power and distinctiveness could match Welch’s — said that she has <em>uyir</em>, Tamil for “life breath,” in her voice, which Doraiswamy was trained to listen for as the soul of vocal art. “It sounds sometimes like [she] is singing to herself and we get to listen in, like we are privy to someone singing to themselves, and they’re making the world less unbearable,” she said. Uyir seems to be something like Federico García Lorca’s <em>duende</em>, of which the great Spanish poet said <a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Spanish/LorcaDuende.php">in a 1933 lecture</a>, “All that has dark sounds has duende. … The duende is a force not a labor, a struggle not a thought. I heard an old maestro of the guitar say: ‘The duende is not in the throat: the duende surges up, inside, from the soles of the feet.’ Meaning, it’s not a question of skill but of a style that’s truly alive: meaning, it’s in the veins: meaning, it’s of the most ancient culture of immediate creation.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Uyir and duende may be lofty claims to make of a creator and performer of pop songs, but we have all been brainwashed to discount popular culture because of its very popularity, to believe that anything beloved by the masses is inherently lesser than esoteric art. This is a begging-the-question fallacy disproved all the time by great popular geniuses like Shakespeare, Mozart, Toni Morrison, Lorca himself. The music of Florence and the Machine is ubiquitous — the night before I left Florida for London, some stranger covered 2008’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOyfLBYtuU">Dog Days Are Over</a>” at karaoke; the band’s 2011 “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbN0nX61rIs">Shake It Out</a>” was piped over the loudspeakers while I waited for my plane in the airport — <em>and</em> it is excellent. It’s absurd to have to insist that both popularity and excellence can coexist.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The music’s ubiquity is perhaps because of the fact that Florence and the Machine sound like nothing else out there in the musical landscape. It’s also, perhaps, because of the spooky vastness of Welch’s vision. Jack Antonoff, the 40-year-old producer and musician with whom Welch worked on her last album, 2022’s “Dance Fever,” said that she might be “literally clairvoyant.” And it’s true: Over and over, her songs predict the world to come. For instance, she wrote the lyrics for several of the album’s songs in 2019, including those of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1VYwALPKE">Choreomania</a>,” a song that Welch based on the 1518 dancing sickness in Strasbourg, where people actually danced until they died. The lyrics, with their frantic repetition of “Something’s coming, so out of breath” became prophetic when Covid-19 started spreading in 2020. “I didn’t know exactly what was coming,” Welch said, “but I knew it was dark.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid21" class="place-ad" data-position="mid21" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Welch may not call herself spiritual, but the thing she kept pulling herself away from speaking about is the thing at the center of her, which she sometimes calls “the monster,” sometimes “the beast.” She struggles to control it, but it seems to be the source of her creative energy. “The beast is very good when it’s onstage. The monster is really useful and full of rage and glory and power,” she said. But as soon as she began talking about the beast, she grew agitated; it felt wrong. Her spiritual sense “doesn’t feel like something I should advertise, because it’s really sacred,” she told me, and changed the topic once more.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When an oracle hears the voice of God and shares what she heard with others, she’s doing the same thing that an artist does while making art. Art is the alchemy by which grand abstractions become material. More than anything else, art requires the body of the artist, readied through time and practice and effort and some sort of innate spark, to become a sort of portal. Welch steps onstage and this portal is immediately available to her. To have the kind of transparency and vulnerability that allows such immediate access to the eternal, mysterious energy requires a great deal from the artist. Which is to say that art so powerful and immediate is demonic in its demands on the small, fleshly human that holds it.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A black-and-white portrait of Florence Welch wearing a large hat." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1792/2250" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 896px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 816px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 817px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A black-and-white portrait of Florence Welch wearing a large hat." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1792" height="2250" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OX8Y-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Ferragamo</strong> dress, $5,000, <a href="http://ferragamo.com/">ferragamo.com</a>; <strong>Chanel</strong> hat, $4,500; and Welch’s own shawl.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

Welch was born like ordinary humans in August 1986; she’s currently 38. Her father, Nick Welch, is a former British advertising executive and, as his daughter called him, “bohemian”; he was the one who introduced her to bands like the Ramones and the Smiths when she was little. Through her mother’s specialty in Renaissance history, as well as family visits to ancient churches, Welch was deeply impressed as a child by the glorious, gory, vermilion-and-gold Catholic imagery, with its St. Sebastians pierced by arrows and St. Agathas with breasts on platters. She loved Greek mythology, she loved history. But nightmares plagued even her daylight hours, and her only escape from the monsters, ghosts and demons that her anxiety summoned was into books. Her mother wanted her to be an academic, but Welch was a daydreamer and had difficulty at school, having dyslexia, dyspraxia and something close to dyscalculia, and she would sneak out of the classroom to sing in the school hallways where the acoustics were good.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Even when Welch was small, she had a Big Voice. She showed me a photo of herself as this little girl in a gingham dress, clutching a trophy for singing. The voice that “came out of that was oddly adult, sensual,” she said. Her mother was always yelling at her to shut up because she’d be singing at the top of her lungs while her mother was trying to write her books. It turns out that the Big Voice is as much a physiological gift as it is a vocation: Welch has a strong diaphragm, a large rib cage with huge lung capacity — which makes finding the vintage dresses that she loves tricky — as well as vocal cords of titanium. Once, fearing that she was losing her voice on tour, she went to see a specialist in Toronto, who looked down her throat only to respond, “Oh, yeah, your vocal cords are like a tank. You’re never gonna lose your voice,” she said. Music was the only thing she ever wanted to do, “Like, I will die if I don’t do it,” she said; singing was the companion that kept her from being alone with the terror. She longed to be in musical theater, but her mother was “the opposite of a stage mom,” Welch added dryly, and only reluctantly conceded to classical voice lessons. The singer trained in opera as a soprano and was only allowed to belt out a Disney song or show tune at the end of her lessons.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The first time she appeared onstage, it was in a school performance of the musical “Bugsy Malone” (1976), and she blew everyone out of the water. “From a really young age, probably like 10, we knew that she was going to be really famous,” said her sister, Grace, who is younger than Welch by three years. (They have a brother, as well, and three stepsiblings.) Welch was hurt after their parents divorced when she was 10, the couple suffering from “simmering, silent resentment but no fights,” she said. She developed an eating disorder when she was a young adolescent. Then, when she was 14, she had her first taste of vodka and felt herself rise, transcendent, out of her anxieties. “Somehow alcohol allowed me to expand, to have freedom from the constraints of the body,” she said. “The first time I had hard spirits, it <em>felt</em> spiritual. I felt warm, I felt free, I felt at peace. It freed me from the relentlessness of thoughts.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-subhed-wrapper g-theme-news svelte-vgydn0" style="--g-subhed-text-align: left;--g-subhed-margin-left: 0"><h2 class="g-subhed g-heading2block svelte-vgydn0"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->All Welch wants is the grace that male performers get. The grace to age in public; the grace to put art at the center of one’s life and not have to be a woman or a mother first.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Suddenly she was a party girl, dancing barefoot over broken glass in nightclubs in ripped vintage dresses. She bartended for a year after secondary school and got deeper into the “doomed Dickensian pirate ship,” as she described it, that was the South London music scene in the early 2000s, when rebellious young artists lived in squats. Welch, like the rest of them, drank to excess and screamed onstage in punk bands. She entered Camberwell College of Arts but dropped out after one year. As a teenager, she also experimented with folk, country and hip-hop-influenced rock. She got her first gig by singing in a nightclub bathroom — more good acoustics — and called her band the Machine after the nickname of one of its long-term members, Isabella Summers, who was a close co-writer, producer and collaborator on the first few albums but hasn’t been involved in the most recent ones. While still a teenager, Welch co-wrote the first song — the punk-pop “Kiss With a Fist” — that, after the band was signed in 2008, became big for them worldwide.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Lungs,” released the next year, is very much a first album, exuberant in its range of styles. “Dog Days Are Over” was the second single, and the first song that would contain everything that Welch’s music has become known for: intense and pure feeling; elliptical lyrics; strange, catchy drums; a tune that starts soft and builds into a great crescendo of sound. Again, critics didn’t get the album — they likened Welch to Fiona Apple, Kate Bush, Regina Spektor, Annie Lennox, Joanna Newsom, Sinead O’Connor, artists whose music has very little to do with one another’s but, well, they’re songwriters and women at the same time, so they must be similar! Some critics were weirdly condescending in their incomprehension: One wrote in Rolling Stone that the “best bits feel like being chased through a moonless night by a sexy moor witch,” which … what is that supposed to sound like? Screaming in terror while trying to run with an erection?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The pressure of new fame was so intense that the singer kept dancing with self-destruction. “In order to protect myself from the public gaze,” she said, “I shrank myself offstage.” When she and her band were working on what would become their first singles, her partying was so out of hand that she nearly blew it with the record company; she was too much of a liability, disappearing for three days into a bender and showing up at a pub mysteriously covered in blue paint. She was also in thrall to an eating disorder, a way to try to impose control on a life that felt uncontrollable. Grace became her personal assistant, and a great deal of the burden of the singer’s bad behavior fell on her. Grace loved her sister, looked up to her and now regrets bitterly how she enabled her. Welch lost days partying, blackout drunk, on drugs. Grace says now that the family has “this joke, like, ‘Thank God she was famous.’ She’s always been supercreative and supercomplicated and supertroubled, and if she didn’t have all that money and, like, a team of people propping her up in her 20s, she’d totally be dead.” Back then, Welch still lived at the family home in Camberwell; she’s an artist who needs to be rooted in place to make her art and hasn’t ever moved away from the neighborhood. Still, no matter how drunk or brutally hung over she was, she was always able to get up onstage and perform.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There’s a rigid cycle in music making: One starts in the studio, creating the songs, which at this point with streaming are practically given away for free; to make money, one has to embark on a grueling two- to three-year schedule of performances, a lifestyle that lends itself easily to drugs and alcohol. Performing in massive venues is hugely physically taxing, particularly when one does it with Welch’s commitment. She throws her entire body into her songs, dances barefoot because she needs to feel the ground beneath her. She has twice broken her foot midway through her concerts but never stopped, instead singing through the pain. A great performer is something of an energy worker, creating a collective experience through her voice and body, and energy needs to be rebuilt before it’s expended again. She tried to control her alcoholism by not drinking when she was performing, but that was worse: She began to binge when she wasn’t on tour.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In 2011, the band released the album “Ceremonials,” which Welch described as a “wall of sound, a wall of aesthetic,” a tumultuous wrestling with her addiction. “I was wandering around like a superhigh Gustav Klimt painting,” she said. The recurrent imagery is that of drowning; in the single “Shake It Out,” the line “It’s hard to dance with a devil on your back” repeats so often it becomes almost frantic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid22" class="place-ad" data-position="mid22" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Not long after, on the singer’s 27th birthday, her mother gave a moving speech, begging her daughter not to join the 27 Club, the group of tormented artists who’d died as a result of addiction, the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle and the radical exposure it requires to be an artist at that age: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain. Welch had shown up to her birthday party drunk and high. Perhaps because of the immensity of her shame, she smashed her whole face into her birthday cake.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There was a moment in the months afterward, lying on the floor of her room, that Welch began to tell me about, saying that she was praying, “Help me, please help me, help me, help me,” but then she trailed off. One doesn’t speak about the holy. “It feels like a betrayal to the thing that helped me,” she said. In any event, after that night, Welch became sober.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For a year, the singer was a “completely broken person,” she said. She’d always loved clothes, had delighted in her dresses onstage, but now she wore the same “horrible blue tracksuit” everywhere. Later on, she had treatment for her eating disorder. When I asked her what had taken the place of the addictions, she told me matter-of-factly, “The performance. The music.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The albums that came afterward were a kind of resetting. For 2015’s “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful,” Welch had just been broken up with and had herself broken up with drugs and alcohol. As a result, the music was stripped down instrumentally, the cover image was black and white and onstage she wore a more masculine suit instead of her previous flowy dresses. Welch was, perhaps not coincidentally, taken more seriously as an artist. When Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters broke his leg and the band had to pull out of headlining the 2015 Glastonbury Festival, Florence and the Machine were asked to replace them. She began to write more poetry. In 2018, Florence and the Machine released “High as Hope,” which is even more stripped down and intimate, with Welch’s poetry becoming its lyrics.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In addition to her albums, the singer has been working for eight years on a musical version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel, “The Great Gatsby,” called “Gatsby: An American Myth,” which I saw in June at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. She was drawn to the book, she said, by the drunkenness and hangover in it, the doomed romanticism, “the way the page sings.” The show got a standing ovation. I thought it was fine. At times, everything was so on the nose that I felt I was being hit with a soft right hook. The set is half nightclub, half car crash, just like the Roaring Twenties; all the characters’ costumes have dirty hems, as though to semaphore that none of them have quite risen above the muck of the American dream. The music is a collaboration between Welch and Thomas Bartlett, who, in addition to being a co-producer and co-writer on some songs on Florence and the Machine’s “High as Hope,” is a gifted musician who’s worked with everyone from Nico Muhly to Yoko Ono and Sufjan Stevens. The songs they made are excellent and surprising, with exciting and slithery Jazz Age rhythms. But art gets in trouble when it becomes polemical, which many of the songs were. I began to wonder if a musical would ever be the right vehicle for a story like “The Great Gatsby.” Musical theater is the most American art form that exists, all dazzle and jazz hands, but Fitzgerald’s novel draws its power from the lightness of its allusions. Things that are hinted at in the book — like Nick Carraway’s crush on Jay Gatsby, or Gatsby’s gangster past — get their own numbers. That said, songs are still being made and discarded. The version I saw, which might one day move to Broadway, hadn’t settled into its final form, and it’s a sin to judge art before it’s finished.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Welch’s most recent album, “Dance Fever,” is my favorite; I played it so often that my younger son began to call it “Mommy’s church.” I find it almost unbearably beautiful, a confirmation that Welch’s songwriting keeps getting more powerful. She had already written the first two songs — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62LtChAwww">King</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8kUKuLBaU">Free</a>” — and was in the studio in New York City in March 2020 with Antonoff when the pandemic hit, and they had to flee to their respective corners. The rest of the songs arrived as Welch’s anxiety spiraled in her London home, the project something of a diary of those years of isolation. Listening now, it feels like a wild, anxious, terrified, hedonistic catharsis of that awful time, a ritual cleansing of the collective grief that we still haven’t fully processed as a culture.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A portrait of Florence Welch wearing a sequined dress with her hair blowing in the air." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1793/2250" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 896.5px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 817px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 818px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A portrait of Florence Welch wearing a sequined dress with her hair blowing in the air." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1793" height="2250" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-OQL1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> dress, price on request, <a href="https://www.louisvuitton.com/">louisvuitton.com</a>; and Welch’s own dress (worn underneath) and jewelry.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

The turn-of-the-20th-century portraits were huge and dramatic and vividly emotional, the rooms thickly crowded. I said I loved the subjects’ expressions; Sargent was a master of distilling character in the subtle look on a face. “I love the fashion,” Welch responded and gestured at “Portrait of Miss Elsie Palmer” (1889-90), depicting a young American girl with reddish hair and bangs like Welch’s, wearing a layered pale pink dress with a pleated underskirt and bodice, her waist tightly cinched.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As we walked, astonishment took hold in me that nobody seemed to recognize the superstar beside me. I’d been sure we’d be so swarmed that I’d had fantasies I’d have to double as a bodyguard, fending fans off with my enormous Muji notebook. But no one did, despite the fact that Welch was on such a state of hyperalert that, when I once tried to take a photo of a stunning Sargent dress on a dummy and her head happened to be in the frame, she swiveled so fast toward me and gave me a look of such searing disdain that I felt flayed. The monster had risen up in her face for a moment. It was terrifying.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Perhaps people in crowds at art museums are deeply unobservant of those around them, only anxious to see the works on the wall; perhaps it was because, with her pale, thin elegance and her feminine dress — delicate flowers on a green field, discreet ruffles and a filigree of off-white lace — she looked as though she were herself a Sargent subject stepping out of the frame. Most likely, however, it was because Welch has built such a powerful public image, a glamorous pagan priestess hologram, that the human person behind it simply didn’t square. Maybe her fans didn’t recognize her because the performer is a giantess and the person is merely person-size.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The image of Florence and the Machine is a curious thing. It’s intricate and carefully constructed, vivid and clear in its referents and set intentionally outside of the contemporary moment, which allows the singer to change and refine the way she presents herself to the world. She seized on it early, after some industry people’s unhappy experiments with trying to market the young singer-songwriter in miniskirts and high-heeled shoes. But she couldn’t sell sex. “I’ve always looked like a haunted painting,” she said, and it’s true that, though she’s beautiful, a bad photograph would show her features as harsh, stern. She also didn’t <em>want</em> to sell sex: “I wanted to be scary when I was younger, not sexy.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To refuse to do so was intentional; it was also lucky. A female artist who’s marketed as sexy must stay at the same level of sexy even as she ages, which is increasingly hard to do, what with gravity and slipping hormones and the frankly fascinating processes of living beyond the body’s natural fertility. Britney Spears will never not exist in the public imagination as a nubile teen in a schoolgirl kilt. Dolly Parton is closing in on 80 with the same blond bouffant and enhanced breasts that she once, at an awards ceremony, called “Shock” and “Awe.” I’d never judge any performer for using her sexuality to sell records; trying to sell art at all is a grind, particularly at the beginning of one’s career, and if the universe has given you a gift of such reach and power, it would be difficult not to use it. But this form of beauty is something of a gilded cage, a safe place for a little time, though also a trap that a woman can’t escape.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="Florence Welch, wearing a brown dress, stands with her hands extended." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2245" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 822px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 823px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Florence Welch, wearing a brown dress, stands with her hands extended." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2245" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O/17tmag-florencewelch-slide-XV8O-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Chloé</strong> dress, $6,490, and dress (worn underneath), $3,990, <a href="https://www.chloe.com/us">chloe.com</a>; and Welch’s own crown, shawl and jewelry.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez. Styled by Vanessa Reid<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Instead of selling a sexualized image, Welch, with the collaboration of music video and photography directors, has created a visual world that’s been seized on by her fans and replicated at her concerts, which can resemble teeming fantasy fashion shows. From the stage, she can look out on a sea of bloody prairie maidens with flower crowns, mermaids with sharp teeth, weeping martyrs, witches in purple silken cloaks, Jesus, tattered ghosts, all images from her songs and videos. Autumn de Wilde, 54, first directed Welch in the 2018 music video for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kIrRooQwuk">Big God</a>,” which is shot as though in outer space, on a stark black stage in a shining one-inch pool of water pierced with high-contrast light. As Welch sings, the dancers’ colorful veils darken as they get wet, then are discarded, until at last Welch levitates the dancers with her voice. “Given the opportunity,” de Wilde said, “if you put her in any world, she will make it iconic and gigantic. You can’t have that without her vulnerability.” The Florence and the Machine aesthetic draws from Pre-Raphaelite tawny goddesses; photos by the 19th-century artist Julia Margaret Cameron; Surrealist 20th-century paintings by Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo; the modern dancer Loie Fuller; exhausted cancan dancers; pastel moths. All come from the same spiritual universe, as dark as true fairy tales tend to be, confections of extreme beauty with neon venom laced through.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It wasn’t until I spoke with de Wilde that I changed my mind about Welch’s image; at first I thought she wielded it like a shield, meaning that she’d constructed it purely to protect the fragility beneath. After, I saw it was something of a seashell, all spikes, dazzling colors, mother-of-pearl gleam. Both shield and shell are created in order to protect the tender flesh within, but a shield is the result of a huge amount of human labor, mining and refining and beating of the hot metal, and a shell is a natural emanation of the beast that builds it. Florence and the Machine is the singer’s true self, but writ large, her imagination allowed freedom to play. The child who spent hours gazing at the light in her room has taken her visions of monsters and saints and demons and graces and made them real.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One of the final portraits at the Sargent show was the well-known “Ellen Terry as Lady MacBeth” (1889), the actress bloody mouthed, with long red braids to her knees, wearing a shining green-and-gold dress, placing a crown upon her head. “We drew on this painting a lot to build our look for ‘Dance Fever,’” Welch told me quietly, smiling.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At this — seeing the queen, her face become a stark mask of ambition — I had a powerful moment of déjà vu. I thought of the lyrics to “King,” when, at the beginning, Welch sings in a low register: “We argue in the kitchen about whether to have children / about the world ending, and the scale of my ambition / And how much art is really worth / The very thing you’re best at is the thing that hurts the most.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Christ on a stick! Show me another popular song that speaks in such a compact way of such vast things: the moral burden of bringing children into the Anthropocene, huge ambition in a female artist, how it’s all complicated when one considers a baby’s hijacking of the body for 40 weeks — and beyond, if the mother is nursing. There are so few examples of female musicians who were able to uphold a rigorous touring schedule after they’d had children that Welch and I could only think of one: Beyoncé. Exacerbating the mixed craving for and fear of having a baby and what it would mean for her art, Welch feels the intense pressure of aging as a female performer. “At 40, what are you supposed to do? Die?” she asked, then laughed darkly. “King” goes on to insist, “I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king.” She isn’t a queen, accessory to power; she’s power itself. “I was also thinking of the King of Rock,” Welch said, referring to Elvis Presley; she was thinking of the right of male artists to let their art be separate from the body, to let the art be so central that everything else is peripheral. In the latter part of the song, Welch raises her voice in a long howl of rage. Maybe I revel in her work because so much of it is simply overflowing with rage, her perfect voice embodying all that subsumed rage that I swallow every day and allowing it to bloom out into the world, a gorgeous shining pitch-black flower.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->All Welch wants is the grace that male performers get. The grace to age in public; the grace to put art at the center of one’s life and not have to be a woman or a mother first. If the universe gives an artist the nearly unlimited ability to become a conduit to the astonishing eternal mysteries, what a grinding check to her momentum when she bumps up against human-imposed boundaries of misogyny. How much worse must be the body’s own betrayal! How enraging that, even as an artist earns more wisdom and depth and artistry — begins to understand how to pull the uncanny powers of the beyond down into constant display on the earth — the body begins to lose its vital energy, and the cost of being alive begins to wear you down.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Art begins in the body; art is limited by the limitations of the body; at some point, art exceeds the body and can live beyond the scope of flesh. I watched Welch look deeply at the gothic, gory Sargent painting of Ellen Terry, and I saw — or imagined I saw — the beast in her surfacing for a moment, hungry for the magic that Sargent enacted on his subjects, allowing them to be fully seen, to be held in the brightest of colors, to be shown to the world eternal in the moment of their greatest glory. Among the many other things Welch refuses to be defined by, she refuses to be defined by time. The tragedy of the Cumean Sibyl, according to the ancient Roman poet Ovid, was that, though the god Apollo did cede to her pleas to give her life beyond the scope of the mortal span, over a thousand years her body shrank until only her voice remained. This is the fate of all artists. All have to come to terms with it at some point. Welch, preternaturally gifted as she is, isn’t exempt.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But until then, oh, you gods who power her, oh, you humans who make her life hum, just let the woman sing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hair by Anthony Turner at Jolly Collective.

Ebony magazine — the chronicler of Black fashion and achievement whose issues were long a staple of Black households, including hers and mine — is a recurring source of material.

What struck Simpson about the story was that it didn’t name the man who found the meteorite but rather the white gentleman farmer who owned the land.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7" style="" aria-label="video">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-hidden="true">    <div class="g-vhs-video svelte-rohdkl"></div></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The artist discusses a film she saw only once but that had a lasting influence on her work.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Video by Kevin “GK” Frederick<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Simpson’s work is about a lot of big topics — race, gender, identity, language — but perhaps above all it is about who gets to be the storyteller.

Her father was a social worker and her mother a secretary. Her parents took her to museums and made sure that art was a part of her life. Initially a street photographer in college, she went on to earn an M.F.A. at the University of California, San Diego. By the time of her first solo exhibition in New York, at Just Above Midtown gallery in 1986, she had already begun to change the language of photography, creating a body of conceptual works that are often characterized by a combination of imagery and text. Sometimes she’d photograph braided hair against a black surface, including spare text panels that read “tug” or “weave.” “Waterbearer,” from 1986, is a black-and-white photograph of a Black woman in a white shift dress viewed from behind. She’s holding a pitcher in one hand and a plastic jug in the other, with water spilling out of both. Beneath the image are lines by Simpson addressing the marginalization of Black women in America: “She saw him disappear by the river, / They asked her to tell what happened, / Only to discount her memory.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a Black woman herself, Simpson knows what it’s like to be left out, undervalued, overlooked. But she turned this feeling of marginalization into a source of empowerment: With no assurance of success or even attention, anything was possible.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Simpson now splits her time between New York and Los Angeles. We met in July, two days after an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, at her cavernous studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, not far from her house in neighboring Fort Greene. The studio was surprisingly tidy given the work that goes on there. (We spoke a second time in August, three weeks after Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and was replaced on the ticket by his vice president, Kamala Harris.) Simpson’s studio was filled with paintings, some new, some old: Looking at them all, it was hard to imagine that she decided to paint for the first time only 10 years ago. (A survey of her paintings will go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in May 2025.) Indeed, her ability to move so successfully across genres is one of the reasons she is now regarded as an essential artist of her generation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7 g-needs-margin-block" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A large painting, predominantly blue, depicting a rocky cliff next to the sea, with a figure in profile in front of the cliff." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1375" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A large painting, predominantly blue, depicting a rocky cliff next to the sea, with a figure in profile in front of the cliff." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1375" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4/17tmag-simpson-artwork-slide-HPG4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Reoccurring” (2021).

I was in a film course and we were given a dilemma: You find tons of footage by an unknown filmmaker and you, as a class, have to restructure this material and make a film out of it. Everybody would then [go out and gather images and] put all of this footage and different things into a pot and we as a group would all edit it into a project and call that the project of an unknown director. So we’re going around the room and me and my New York ass, I have pictures from Harlem that I found and different things that are so New York.

I came from [the mentality of] if I can live through this, then the world is my oyster. And so when I think about my ambition or applying for grants or internships, it was done with the thought that if I got a no, it just didn’t matter. I wasn’t attached to outcomes, for some reason. The momentum was more important to me. I had to be very self-reliant.

Part of that to me is also occupying space in a particular way.

And because they were sloppy, they had clients coming in while they were talking to me because they couldn’t get their freaking schedules right.

It was the spring of 2023, and the fashion designer was watching a playback on a monitor at Cinecittà, the film studio on the outskirts of Rome where he and the director Luca Guadagnino had been working on an adaptation of “Queer,” the autobiographical novel by William S. Burroughs, written in the 1950s but published three decades later. Anderson, the Northern Irish creative director of Loewe and the founder of his own clothing line, JW Anderson, was overseeing the costumes. The two friends had worked together before on Guadagnino’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/movies/challengers-review-zendaya-mike-faist-josh-oconnor.html">Challengers</a>” (2024), about a love triangle set in the world of competitive tennis, but their second feature collaboration, which follows a gay American expat, played by Daniel Craig, from midcentury Mexico City into the Ecuadorean jungle on a search for ayahuasca, was more ambitious, requiring period clothing for hundreds of actors and extras. As they reviewed the footage, Anderson, who had stepped into the frame to fix something on Craig’s costume, realized that he’d been captured onscreen. What he saw disturbed him. The prodigy with tousled blond hair who’d started his brand in 2008 at age 23 had been replaced by a man on the verge of middle age. But it wasn’t just that he looked somewhat disheveled: Anderson had been so busy working that he’d lost track of time. “I was like, who <em>is</em> that person?” he recalls thinking. “And what have I done in the last 10 years?”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->On a crisp morning this past February, Anderson is recounting the experience in his townhouse in the East London borough of Hackney. Although he’s warm and self-mocking, he gives the impression that he’s never not at least a little on edge. “When you’re working all the time, you end up being addicted to the next show,” he says. “You’re so busy outdoing yourself that you don’t realize what you’ve done.” The early light cuts across a Le Corbusier stool, a white linen sofa by Axel Vervoordt and a pair of Georgian-style yellow armchairs in the living room. “You’re trying to be a normal person,” he adds. “And people are expecting you to be happy all the time and have an idea. But sometimes you just don’t.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Anderson’s restlessness seems particularly intense right now, perhaps because it’s the year he turns 40, or because, despite having more than a few fears, the thing that scares him most is feeling truly seen. “I’m more of a voyeur,” he says. “I’ve never wanted to be like, ‘Here I am!’” And yet, for the past couple of years, it’s been difficult to avoid hearing his name or Loewe’s, which, until quite recently, most people probably couldn’t pronounce. (In 2018, the brand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOL4fD3kUdg">released a video</a> of models struggling to get it right; it’s “Lo-WEH-vay,” the actor and filmmaker Dan Levy tells his co-star Aubrey Plaza in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihIZVg1-ztM">a recent promotional short</a>.) In February of last year, Anderson was in a motel in the Arizona desert dressing Rihanna for her Super Bowl halftime show. The performer, who used the occasion to announce her second pregnancy, wore a red Loewe boiler suit and leather breastplate. A few months later, Beyoncé kicked off her Renaissance World Tour in a bespoke Loewe bodysuit embellished with strategically placed sequined hands. And this past spring, the “Challengers” press tour felt like one long fashion show, with all three lead actors — Mike Faist, Josh O’Connor and Zendaya — wearing Loewe outfits, including, in Zendaya’s case, shoes made from 3-D-printed tennis balls. “Actors are strange people in a good way,” says Anderson, who once trained to be one himself. “They’re like vessels. You can pour in whatever you want.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The same might be said of his clothes. If some designers have become famous for introducing a new silhouette or landing on a signature look and then finding countless ways to reiterate it, Anderson has a reputation for being more mercurial. With each collection, he’s either adding a new layer to an existing idea (a mesh slip dress with a balloon motif one season; shoes made of real balloons the next) or rejecting it outright. His take on fashion isn’t exactly theatrical — some of the garments can be quite subtle — but his clothes tend to come with an element of performance. As the actress Greta Lee, who has appeared in multiple Loewe campaigns, says, Anderson’s creations have a way of activating “an elevated version of your essence.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Two days from now, he’ll present his fall 2024 JW Anderson women’s collection at a gymnasium in London’s Marylebone neighborhood. “The show we’re working on is very British woman in suburbia,” says Anderson, who’s in the process of rejecting his louder recent offerings and the attention they received. “When it gets too much, my natural reaction is to go for a silent year.” As he sets down a pot of coffee on an 18th-century oak dining table in his kitchen, he makes a face that reappears, not infrequently, whenever he’s feeling agitated: a look of dread cut with a smile, a sort of breaking of the fourth wall that indulges his neuroses while also attempting to undermine them.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In conversation, Anderson can be an exuberant and compelling catastrophizer, and the more time one spends observing him, the more one starts to feel that his own relationship to fashion might be read as a kind of performance, too: At the end of his runway shows, when he emerges to take a bow, it’s always with his head down and shoulders slumped, almost as if he’s been forced into receiving applause. Designers, he once told me, are “kind of biblically hated,” and his view of the entire industry can seem equally bleak, even if he’s stating it for effect: The magazines that once held such sway are increasingly irrelevant; connoisseurship is dead; everything is generic. But rather than dispirit him, all of this only pushes him to fight harder. “I feel like we’re in this amazing moment where it’s going to be survival of the fittest,” he says. His voice has intensified into a high-pitched whisper, every word delivered as if it were part of a lurid blind item. He smiles again.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->His ambition is clear: He’s determined to become the world’s best living fashion designer. What’s sometimes murkier is why he wants this. “I’m sure people would say that I’m arrogant,” he says. His goals, though, are simple and practical. “Bag sales need to get to here; the stores need to be like this. But these are just actions,” he says. “The big thing is, ‘What am I getting out of it creatively?’” Another question might be: How long can he keep it all up?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-slideshow-wrapper svelte-xzcuaq" data-id="100000009731261"><div class="g-slideshow-viewer svelte-xzcuaq"><button class="prev svelte-xzcuaq" style="display: none;" data-svelte-h="svelte-7qwb7w"><img src="https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2024-09-27-tmag-greats/b2a0c71a-d1c2-47fb-ae32-7d568437bc5c/_assets/prev.svg"></button> <button class="next svelte-xzcuaq" style="display: none;" data-svelte-h="svelte-1empjig"><img src="https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2024-09-27-tmag-greats/b2a0c71a-d1c2-47fb-ae32-7d568437bc5c/_assets/next.svg"></button> <swiper-container style="--swiper-navigation-color: #fff; --swiper-pagination-color: #fff" class="g-slideshow svelte-xzcuaq" thumbs-swiper="[data-id='100000009731261'] .g-slideshow-nav" space-between="10" navigation="true" navigation-next-el="[data-id='100000009731261'] .next" navigation-prev-el="[data-id='100000009731261'] .prev"><swiper-slide data-id="100000009731261" class="svelte-xzcuaq"><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-141yli7" style="" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-default svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" aria-label="A model poses in an oversized green, grey and black parka and yellow boots." role="img"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2169" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 850px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 851px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A model poses in an oversized green, grey and black parka and yellow boots." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2169" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O/17tmag-jw-fashion-shoot-slide-964O-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div> </div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-cu2gla"><p class="g-caption svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Loewe</strong> viscose circular-sleeve parka and lambskin bracelet ankle boots from the fall 2021 women’s collection.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-cu2gla"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photograph by Johnny Dufort.

hired by LVMH to revive Loewe, a fashion house established in Madrid in 1846 as a leather-making collective. When the French conglomerate, which also has a stake in JW Anderson, fully acquired Loewe in 1996, clothing was responsible for about 10 percent of sales, which hovered around $200 million. For four years beginning in 1997, the American designer Narciso Rodriguez repositioned it as a ready-to-wear label, delivering simple, sellable clothes. Later, the British designer Stuart Vevers would shift the company’s focus back to handbags. So, unlike Saint Laurent or Gucci — where, some have speculated, Anderson might one day end up — Loewe was a bit of a blank slate. There wasn’t much of a heritage to adhere to, and Anderson started running it as if he were operating an experimental gallery, presenting customers with things they didn’t know they wanted and couldn’t quite understand. His debut women’s collection for the brand, held in an Isamu Noguchi-designed sculpture garden outside of the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in June 2014, featured baggy leather pants in pale blue and bright yellow, macramé halter tops and latex T-shirts with a mallard motif. In the years since, he’s become an uncanny illusionist, producing trompe l’oeil garments and incorporating surprising materials — from makeup brushes to sink drain covers — that can feel almost like sleights of hand or, as one critic put it, “decidedly normal things made abnormal.” At his spring 2016 women’s show, he sent models out in pants covered with shards of mirrored glass; his spring 2023 women’s collection included dresses with bodices shaped like anthuriums. His interests, which are communicated through each garment, are varied. “He can discuss an inspiration trip to Naples — and, like, napkins — forever,” says Lee. “You could be talking about [the pop star] Charli XCX and then he’ll be like, ‘Look at this amazing Venetian artifact I found,’” says the actress and writer Ayo Edebiri. “The problem with the world,” Anderson says, “is that there are so many things to discover.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A decade in, Anderson has transformed the formerly sleepy Spanish label into one of fashion’s noisiest and most innovative hype machines — and, frankly, its most meme-able — almost single-handedly reinvigorating red-carpet showmanship and shaping online fashion discourse more than maybe any other designer of his generation. Some of the clothes almost seem to project hostility toward the enterprise at hand — models have struggled to walk in molded Plasticine shorts; one floor-length dress, pierced at the neck with a giant sewing pin, felt more like a dare than an outfit — but there’s a playfulness to them, too. Plaza, known for her deadpan humor, says she felt “spiritually connected” to the “soft, buttery gown with an aggressive spear cutting through it” that she wore this past January for the 2023 Emmys.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid23" class="place-ad" data-position="mid23" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->According to Anderson, Loewe is now a roughly $2 billion business. (He wants to grow the company to $3 billion. It’s “really American of me,” he says.) In his ability to make clothes that are both avant-garde and commercial, Anderson has something in common with Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese designer of Comme des Garçons. Pieter Mulier, the Belgian creative director of the brand Alaïa, says that the two designers also share a sense of modesty. “The public doesn’t know much about Jonathan’s private life,” says Mulier, who lives near Anderson in Paris. “And I think that’s much more respectable than, let’s say, the older generation, where designers were nearly as big as the brands they worked for.” Describing her first impression of Anderson, Lee says, “This sounds kind of insulting, but he was so <em>normal</em>,” and compares his look (he’s almost always in jeans and a T-shirt) to that of a “hot fraternity brother” from a Midwestern college. “He’s not one of those reclusive artists who’s in his own cave.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Levy, Anderson’s friend, says, “In an industry where test audiences and algorithms dictate a lot of what we do creatively, he’s somehow managed to work within the system but challenge it at the same time.” The Scottish stylist Joe McKenna, an early supporter of Anderson’s work, says, “The clothes weren’t repeating an idea, but you believed [they were] from the same hand as the previous collections you’d seen. A bit like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/19/t-magazine/miuccia-prada-fashion.html">Miuccia Prada</a>, he’s constantly rummaging through his own language box to pull out new things.” Also like Prada, a hero and former employer of his, he’s more interested in exploring different materials and fabrication techniques than in creating another pretty dress. (Whether a garment is flattering is often beside the point — awkwardness, if not the goal, is encouraged.) “For some people, their drug is the idea of continuity,” he says. “That is not my drug. We have bags for that.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But not everyone can pull off a stiletto with a cracked-egg heel (spring 2022) or a coat and shoes sprouting living grass (spring 2023), and Anderson also designs things for clients who aren’t quite so bold: The Loewe Puzzle, a handbag introduced in 2014 and made by jigsawing together geometric pieces of leather, has become the brand’s answer to the Hermès Birkin or Fendi Baguette; in 2022, a padded Loewe bomber jacket, shaped a bit like a leather-wrapped Hershey’s Kiss, sold out after Kendall Jenner posted a photo of herself wearing a green one. There are few designers who can exploit the internet so deftly: This past June, days after someone on social media described an heirloom tomato as being “so Loewe,” Anderson revealed a red leather Loewe handbag that looked much like the fruit in question. In 2022, the night before her album “Crash” came out, Charli XCX was photographed carrying the JW Anderson Bumper, a rectangular shoulder bag outlined with tubular padding; two months later, she became the face of the accessory. “The reason he’s able to attract all these different creative people,” she says, is because he’s one of them.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Designers have a long history of collaborating with artists, but what separates Anderson, who identifies as a snob, from some of his peers is that he’s genuinely curious about objects and other art forms, and deeply knowledgeable about the references he deploys in his work. A compulsive collector of art, he’s kept a portrait of a man sitting on a chair, by the mid-20th-century American photographer Peter Hujar, next to his bed in London; a large assortment of his other works — many of them by gay artists, including 1940s photographs of male nudes by George Platt Lynes and a 1960s Paul Thek wax-and-steel sculpture that resembles hunks of meat — will eventually reside at a house he’s been building in North London.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In 2016, Anderson, who’s also a trustee on the board of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, inaugurated the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, an annual award recognizing excellence among potters, textile artists and other makers. (The latest recipient was the Mexican-born ceramist Andrés Anza.) Over the years, he’s reinterpreted the work of other underappreciated or overlooked gay artists, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/arts/design/joe-brainard-tibor-de-nagy.html">Joe Brainard</a>, an informal member of the New York School in the 1960s, whose collages of pansies were printed on shirts and woven into cardigans for Loewe’s fall 2021 men’s collection; the homoerotic Finnish illustrator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/t-magazine/tom-of-finland.html">Tom of Finland</a>, whose estate has partnered with JW Anderson on a few occasions; and the American artist and AIDS activist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/magazine/the-rage-and-tenderness-of-david-wojnarowiczs-art.html">David Wojnarowicz</a>, who died of complications from the disease in 1992 and whose work, including “Untitled (One Day This Kid … )” (1990-91), was repurposed for a clutch and a custom suit with ballooning sleeves worn by Levy at the 2021 Met Gala, which was dedicated that year to American fashion.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A cynical reading of Anderson’s work might accuse him of cultural vampirism: By positioning himself alongside history’s great embattled artists, he makes his own output feel all the more subversive. But there’s a delicateness to his approach; few designers, if any, care or know enough to challenge the artists they’re working with to try something new. The 82-year-old American artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/13/t-magazine/lynda-benglis-art-greats.html">Lynda Benglis</a>, famous for her wax paintings and poured latex sculptures — and whose massive fountains dominated the set of the spring 2024 Loewe men’s show — ended up designing jewelry for the brand. The Los Angeles-based artist <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/seeing-things-richard-hawkinss-haunted-houses/">Richard Hawkins</a>, 63, whose collages of young heartthrobs, often either bloodied or sexualized, adorned sweatpants, beaded leather bags and knitted tunics for Loewe’s fall 2024 men’s collection, was skeptical when he was asked to collaborate. His concern, he says, was that his work would be reduced to “coffee cups and mouse pads.” Instead, Anderson added another dimension to Hawkins’s pinup universe, inviting the artist to create video works for the show featuring actors such as Jamie Dornan and Manu Rios, who sat nearby in the front row. He and Anderson included at least one actor with an OnlyFans page, but Hawkins says he was told to avoid depictions of masturbation. “I think Jonathan pushes [LVMH] as far as they’ll go when it comes to sexuality and queerness.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-slideshow-wrapper svelte-xzcuaq" data-id="100000009720198"><div class="g-slideshow-viewer svelte-xzcuaq"><button class="prev

Paris’s Ninth Arrondissement. When we last met, in London before the fall 2024 JW Anderson show — which ended up telegraphing an uneasy vision of English nostalgia, with models, some of them in curly gray wigs, wearing stodgy underwear and minidresses made from skeins of knitting wool — Anderson was edgy but focused, maybe even a little cocky. Now, three days after his fall 2024 women’s show for Loewe, he seems ready to murder someone.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“After a show, you don’t want to be near me,” he warns, smoking next to an open window on a cloudy afternoon in March. The Loewe collection, which offered a quirky take on aristocratic style with morning coats embroidered with tiny caviar beads and a crepe jersey shift dress with a blurry tartan motif, had been a success. (One of the three fashion critics whom he pays much attention to called the show “great” and “inspiring.”) But he’s standing next to his antique wooden desk — uncluttered except for a white vase of Creamsicle-hued buttercups and a mug with a drawing on it of a five-man orgy — trying not to explode. Before the pandemic, Anderson would fly to Miami or Argentina after his final show of the season; this year, he stayed in Paris with his boyfriend, the Catalan artist Pol Anglada, 33, with whom he frequently collaborates, succumbing to what he describes as nonverbal “death spirals.” That some of his fellow designers had gotten similar praise for work that Anderson sees as inferior to his — “You can’t just fake a formula”; “It’s the same product”; “It looked like Neiman Marcus” — infuriates him, as if the approval is meaningless when it’s not only his to receive.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As energized as he is by winning, Anderson feels like there’s no one to outdo. “I’m looking out there and there’s nothing,” he says. When that happens, he creates his own challenges. With “Queer,” for example, he decided that the cast would wear almost exclusively vintage clothing from the 1940s and ’50s. (“Down to my boxer briefs,” says the actor Drew Starkey, who plays Craig’s love interest. “It was nerve-racking,” says Craig. “If you spill coffee all over the suit, it’s ruined.”) One of the few times Anderson was jealous of someone else’s work — “It’s so amazing when you see a show and you’re like, ‘<em>Damn it</em>,’” he says — was in 2021, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/13/t-magazine/demna-balenciaga-greats.html">Demna</a>, the provocative creative director of Balenciaga, came out with his first couture collection. “I thought it was groundbreaking in terms of proportion and silhouette and nostalgia and non-nostalgia and angst,” he says, “and what couture could mean.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Andrew Webster, an old friend of Anderson’s and the brand image director at JW Anderson, says, “Jonathan is an overworker, to the point where, even if we’re all fatigued and exhausted, he’s like, ‘I’ve got another idea.’” Unlike many members of his generation, Anderson doesn’t feel a compunction to find <em>something</em> nice to say about others’ efforts in the office. More than once, he’s interrupted a design meeting to tell the team that “everything’s a disaster”; he’s also been known to scrap social media posts and entire campaigns. The French stylist Benjamin Bruno, one of Anderson’s most trusted creative partners, admits that they’ve had some “extremely fiery and dramatic” disagreements over the years. “If you don’t argue,” says Bruno, “it means you don’t care.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Each year, Anderson releases a total of eight runway collections for Loewe and JW Anderson, traveling between Paris and London. While it’s rare for a designer who runs a business the size of Loewe to still have their own label with a fully realized identity and fan base — Anthony Vaccarello suspended his brand after being hired at Saint Laurent in 2016; the late Virgil Abloh kept Off-White going following his Louis Vuitton appointment, but he didn’t design women’s wear there — Anderson treats JW Anderson as a kind of creative laboratory. If Loewe is eccentric and unpredictable, JW Anderson can feel downright volatile. The same year that a Loewe dress was structured into a car shape, BMX handlebars and broken skateboards were incorporated into JW Anderson tops and sweaters. “This is someone who has something quite bold to say,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/t-magazine/matthieu-blazy-bottega-veneta-inspirations.html">Matthieu Blazy</a>, Bottega Veneta’s creative director, recalls thinking after attending one of Anderson’s shows. “If you really want to push the boundaries of clothing,” says Anderson, “you have to be a bit obsessive.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->IN A WAY, Anderson was raised to win. He was born in 1984 in Magherafelt, a small town in Northern Ireland, during the Troubles, the sectarian conflict that lasted from the late 1960s to 1998 between the largely Protestant unionists, who wanted the province to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the mostly Roman Catholic nationalists, who wanted to secede. His mother, Heather, taught high school English. His father, Willie, was a star rugby player. (To this day, Webster, who describes the Anderson clan as “salt-of-the-earth people,” says, “It’s a very slow journey if you’re out with Willie because everyone wants to chat with him or buy him a drink.”) Before heading off to school, Anderson would check underneath the car for bombs. “I was so lucky that I grew up in that because [it makes] you realize you can lose everything in a heartbeat,” he says.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid24" class="place-ad" data-position="mid24" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a teenager, Anderson, who has an older brother, Thomas, now the operations director of JW Anderson, and a younger sister, Chloe, would trawl the racks of a local department store for dead-stock Jean Paul Gaultier. “In Ireland, the idea of standing out is a very unusual thing,” says Anderson, who nonetheless belongs to a long line of eccentrics who grew up there; like Oscar Wilde and Francis Bacon, who were antagonized or jailed for being gay, he’s learned how to wield his wit like a weapon. “Sometimes you can only reflect on how amazing a country is by getting out,” he says. “[James] Joyce had to leave Ireland to write about it.” At 18, Anderson relocated for a couple of years to Washington, D.C., to study performance at the Studio Acting Conservatory. Although his parents were supportive, he recalls their telling him, “Do what you want. Just don’t spend money you don’t have.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Back in Northern Ireland, Anderson was kind of a loner, but in Dupont Circle, the gay neighborhood where he was living in the basement of a George Stumpf-style townhouse, he felt like everyone was his best friend. Instead of focusing on honing his craft, Anderson says, “it was literally Girl Gone Wild.” Within a week of being there, he’d started drinking and smoking. On one occasion, he went to a party in Baltimore for what he thought was one night; only afterward did he come to realize that three days had passed. “I’d gone from being this polite child to being a mental person,” he says.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A couple of years later, Anderson, who’d run out of money, returned to Ireland. He moved into a rental apartment in Dublin with Willie, who had been commuting from home to coach the Leinster rugby team. (“My dad was only there two days a week,” says Anderson with a smirk. And at that point, “I know <em>exactly</em> who I am.”) He got a job as a sales associate in the men’s wear department at a clothing store. It was an exciting time in men’s fashion: Tom Ford was doubling down on louche glamour for Gucci; Hedi Slimane had been proposing a new superskinny silhouette at Dior Homme. After work, Anderson would borrow outfits to wear clubbing and hope that no one accidentally burned them with a cigarette; one assumes that even if they had, he’d have put the garments back on the rack the next morning.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Eventually, when the luster of late nights had mostly worn off, he put together what he calls “a weird mood board of stuff” and applied to various universities. The one school that accepted him was London College of Fashion. Between classes, he worked as a visual merchandiser under Manuela Pavesi, Miuccia Prada’s close friend and trusted colleague, at Prada. Pavesi, who died in 2015, liked to wear pajamas with diamonds; knowing this, Anderson arrived for his interview in a vintage paisley dressing gown that he’d cut above the knee — “almost sort of slutty,” says Webster, who would become his manager at Prada — with tight Dior jeans underneath and a pair of Prada boots. While they were working on a window display one day, Webster recalls, Anderson disappeared; he later found the designer on the street, wearing a long coat covered with accessories that he’d designed, getting his picture taken for i-D magazine. “Jonathan was always a bit of an opportunist, really,” says Webster, later adding, “He has this ability to wrap you up into his orbit, and you’re not quite sure how you got there sometimes, but you’re in it.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><div class="g-slideshow-wrapper svelte-xzcuaq" data-id="100000009720430"><div class="g-slideshow-viewer

he describes as “woeful” and “the most ridiculous” — at a London nightclub in 2005; the cabaret star Justin Vivian Bond, in an ermine stole and a headpiece made from netting and plastic flies, sang as the models came down the runway. (Anderson and Webster still play the recording of Bond and Kenny Mellman’s 2004 show at Carnegie Hall, “Kiki and Herb Will Die for You,” on a loop at the JW Anderson studio.) “Jonathan has the discernment to know that [the drag performer] Divine, although queer and much more contemporary than, say, [the 18th-century English painter Thomas] Gainsborough, is also, in their way, a masterpiece,” says Bond. “Knowing what’s extraordinary in many contexts — he’s really good at keying into that.” In his JW Anderson designs, some of which took inspiration from the early 20th-century Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin and William Gedney’s 1960s photographs of American teenagers, Anderson, who doesn’t sketch, laid the groundwork for what would become his pastiche approach. Even now, he says that the part of the process he loves most is “trying to get this weird thing — a color or a painting — out of my brain.” Seldom do the clothes come from something as straightforward as “shearling” or “sci-fi,” says Bruno, who has a background in art criticism and literature. “It’s a little more psychological than that.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Not coincidentally, Anderson’s closest friends and collaborators — among them Bruno, Guadagnino and the rapper and fashion designer ASAP Rocky, who shares, he says, an “innate search for the peculiar” — are magpies and polymaths with strong but ever-changing visual identities. “He’s the right kind of crazy,” says Rocky, who created a JW Anderson capsule collection in 2016. “Anytime I’m hitting a brick wall, my guy is always like, ‘Maybe you should do this, maybe you should do that.’ And if he needs some advice, like, ‘Maybe you should think twice about inviting these corny-ass celebs to your next show,’ I’m there to voice that, too.” Bruno observes, “Jonathan trusts people, but only if he thinks they excel at what they’re doing.” As a leader, Anderson believes in “turning up the temperature just enough without breaking people,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to get people to go down your vision hole, and you’ve got to hold their hand to make sure they don’t waver.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Things were much simpler all those years ago, when Anderson and Bruno would sit on the floor of Anderson’s London studio late at night, constructing what Bruno refers to as “ghosts of garments” with as many swatches of fabric as they could afford. Anderson was an early practitioner of genderless dressing — he has separate men’s and women’s lines, but the sense has always been that anyone should wear whatever they like — although that, too, was partly a practical decision. “We were just sharing the same patterns because he couldn’t afford to have the atelier make two,” says Webster. “His enthusiasm was so contagious and so naïve that you could only say yes to him,” Bruno says. “There was that kind of youthful hope that you have when you don’t know too much about life.” A decade into his time at Loewe, Anderson has learned some difficult lessons. “Nothing will ever be good enough,” he says, sounding just like an uncompromising artist. “It’s quite lonely working two jobs in two different countries every week for 10 years.” Still, the idea of giving up fashion seems just as impossible. It’s been the vehicle for all his creative explorations and collaborations. The product might be clothes; the point, though, is craft.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“FEEL IT, IT’S so hard,” says Josh O’Connor. In a suite at the Carlyle hotel on New York’s Upper East Side on the eve of the Met Gala this past May, the 34-year-old British actor is gesturing toward his custom Loewe white vest, which is covered with thousands of tiny caviar beads. But the 10 or so other people in the room, including Anderson, are distracted by his pants. Someone reports that Harry Lambert, O’Connor’s stylist, thinks his boots, which are also intricately beaded, with a floral motif, are too big, causing the pants to buckle at the ankles.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lambert’s assistant enters the room holding a pair of plain black boots. “Is she <em>kidding</em>?” says Anderson — flowers must remain on the footwear somehow to adhere to the gala’s theme — redirecting his attention to O’Connor, who looks down at his legs with an exaggerated display of shame. “Let’s add more satin,” says a member of Anderson’s team, instructing another to widen the pant legs. But it’s Sunday night, they’re told; all the fabric stores are closed. “Then cut the top of the boot,” says Anderson with a measured impatience. “Well, no,” the employee says. It would create too big of a mess. “But we could try buttons?”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Except for the faint sound of a Dolly Parton song playing in the background, the room goes silent. It’s almost like watching the final set of a tennis match; neither opponent is prepared to yield. After what feels like forever, Anderson is the first to relent. “Buttons on the back,” he says with a shrug. “But make sure they’re not too round.” In the end, they agree to tighten the top of the boot with a string. Having averted a crisis, the crew starts packing up. It’s time for dinner and then a meeting with Lee, who will be wearing what Anderson describes as a “new type of structure” at tomorrow’s event — a white Loewe gown with floral appliqués and a neckline that extends upward and outward like an aerodynamic shield.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Anderson’s phone buzzes: His mother has been reminding him to send her some pictures from the party. The following week, he’ll be needed back in Paris to award the winner of the 2024 Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. Then he’ll unveil his latest collaboration with the running brand On and, shortly after that, he’ll present his new men’s wear collections for JW Anderson and Loewe. (The latter, titled A Radical Act of Restraint, is partly inspired by the work of Hujar and Thek.) In the coming months, he’ll release new Loewe campaigns starring Craig and Starkey — an unofficial kickoff to the “Queer” press tour, which could be even bigger than that for “Challengers.” As he goes through his schedule, a look of foreboding washes across his face. “You’re trying to be the son and the brother and the boyfriend, and you want to be a nice person,” says Anderson, who’s been doing breathing exercises when he gets stressed out. Then a big, boyish smile spreads across his face. “I’ve never had so much fun in my life.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-urmhfi"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Model: Achol Ayor at Women Management.

They didn’t fail her but, she says, “It taught me I just have to persevere with my own agenda, and I don’t need to be in conversation.” Or look at Welch, whose first, transformative album with her band Florence and the Machine, “Lungs” (2009), confounded many critics, who, the novelist Lauren Groff writes in her profile of the singer-songwriter, “struggled to place her,” comparing her to other artists whose sounds didn’t really resemble hers but who were, after all, women."},{type:"text",value:"But sometimes the artist stands alone because what they’re doing has no modern or popular precedent.

Or consider Anderson, whose restless curiosity makes us rethink what clothes are — nothing so simple or straightforward as sexy or wearable, his fashion challenges the point of fashion itself.

He’s an inheritor of the legacy of Marcel Duchamp and his readymades, mass-produced and utilitarian objects that the French artist displayed as art. In a sense, Gates has scaled up the method. Duchamp’s readymades include a snow shovel and a bicycle wheel; Gates’s are old factories and homes. To some extent, he doesn’t think of them as property at all. “The beauty of these buildings gives me a tremendous amount of joy,” he said. “It’s an artistic idiom of its own.”"},{type:"scoopslideshow",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopSlideshow",assetSlug:"100000009750314",breakpointName:void

After that, he began investing in Grand Crossing when he moved to the South Side to become an arts administrator at the University of Chicago, where he’s now a professor. “The neighborhood had stigma, but the people were great and interesting,” he said. He recognized the terrain: Black neighborhoods that faced disinvestment and crime but were once self-contained and self-possessed — places where, he said, “the Black doctor and lawyer and bus driver and maid were all on the same block, and they all went to the same church.” By revitalizing these quotidian spaces — homes, a bank, a school, hardware stores that he has bought, often with their contents, when they were going out of business — he is summoning a kind of utopian memory in the service of new functions. “It’s not just the bourgeois dimension of ‘He owns a building,’” Gates’s friend the artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa, 63, told me. “It’s more about a transgression of some primary interdictions with regard to Black people, which is that you cannot manage material. You will be material. But to manage material is a whole other thing.” Through his investments in Grand Crossing — even when they take unconventional forms — Gates sees himself as helping Chicago to “hold its Black self together.”"},{type:"ad",value:{id:19,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"He took me down a side street edged by commuter rail tracks where in 2021 he opened Kenwood Gardens, a sanctuary with lawns, wildflowers and a pavilion that hosts house-music parties in the summer.

A wall encircling the garden is made partly from bricks that he saved from St. Laurence Catholic Church, a neighborhood anchor that the archdiocese sold and that was razed in 2014."},{type:"text",value:"“When I built the perimeter wall, I didn’t own the property,” Gates said. “I built the wall to stop the bad stuff.” He then bought the lots, many loaded with tax arrears. “The city was quite happy to help us negotiate the land sales,” he said, “because they would finally have a steward.” Building his unauthorized wall, Gates said, was a case of tactical urbanism, as citizen initiatives that bypass city bureaucracy or goad it to action are called in the planning business."},{type:"text",value:"Gates is compact, with a shaved head and salt-and-pepper beard, and he dresses comfortably in collarless shirts, loose pants and leather loafers. When he gets excited about a topic, he can take on the tone of a minister addressing his congregation. He is too obviously sincere, even earnest, to come across as an operator. And yet he has both an aptitude and an appetite for policy and negotiations. In a famous deal, he purchased the former Stony Island State Savings Bank, a 1920s edifice facing demolition, from the city in 2012 for $1 and the commitment to restore it — which he funded in part by selling salvaged marble slabs at Art Basel for $5,000 each. It now hosts collections, exhibitions and events. “You learn policy, you know the rules, you play with it,” he said. “Then you can make a case.” Romi Crawford, 58, a professor of visual and critical studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, described how Gates enfolds transactions into his art as “contract aesthetics.” Gates has fielded periodic criticism that he is too amenable to the rich and powerful. He rejects this, returning to the word “tactical.” “If you’re talking about protesting, there are people who are better protesters,” he said. “If you’re talking about getting [things] done in the city, I can do it better than most artists.

His parents had bought their four-apartment home amid late ’60s white flight for $23,000, paying installments to the seller, who eventually forgave the balance."},{type:"text",value:"Gates toggled between worlds, as he has done ever since. He was bused to the North Side starting in fifth grade, then attended Lane Tech, a selective public high school; in that respect, he told me, “I’m a child of integration and affirmative action.” In the neighborhood, he said, “every summer, more of my friends were in gangs.” He was different: churchy, charismatic, coddled by his big sisters. In lieu of an allowance, his father paid him to help on roofing jobs and fixing buildings. “I was around serial entrepreneurship and prayerful way-making,” Gates told me. “It wasn’t a way to get rich. It was a way to look out for your family and have control of the emotional environment, not have an outside force telling you what to do.”"},{type:"text",value:"Summers in Mississippi reinforced that idea. In a classic Great Migration pattern, his parents had come up from the Delta — his father from Yazoo City, his mother from Humphreys County nearby. Most of her siblings remained there, and Gates would spend summers with his uncle Herbert, who owned a 500-acre farm, growing corn, cotton and soy beans and raising cattle and hogs. It was an education in the land and its stakes: Other Black families lived on the farm — “The only word we have for it is ‘sharecroppers,’” Gates said — and the surrounding white farmers were trying to squeeze Herbert out. Mississippi, Gates said, is where he learned to appreciate scale: “I understand square blocks because I understand acres.” It’s also a recurring reference in his art. For \u003Ca href=\"https://www.msmuseumart.org/the-great-migration/\">a 2022 exhibition\u003C/a> of contemporary takes on the Great Migration at the Mississippi Museum of Art, he designed an installation called “Double Wide” inspired by the trailer on his uncle’s land that was a candy store by day and a juke joint after dark."},{type:"text",value:"Arriving at Iowa State University in 1992, Gates decided to major in urban planning (in which he’d later earn a master’s degree) with a double minor in studio art and religious studies. He learned about nonconformists like Samuel Mockbee, the architect who in 1993 co-founded the Rural Studio program, known for designing homes from recycled materials in the Alabama Black Belt. On the side, he discovered pottery, becoming close with a ceramics professor, Ingrid Lilligren, who would remain a mentor."},{type:"text",value:"After college, Gates won a scholarship to study for a master’s degree in traditional African religion at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Then, following a brief stint in Seattle, he returned to Chicago in 1999 when he was hired by the transit authority. After hours, he’d rent kilns at the Lillstreet Art Center. He wanted, he said, to become good at something. “I went to my day job, and I would come home, go to the studio and make pots,” he said. “That unromantic development was very helpful for me. I was gaining skill in darkness, with no one interested.”"},{type:"text",value:"Once, he recalled, he made three soda-fired bowls to sell at the DuSable Museum’s market devoted to Black artisans. A customer offered $75, less than Gates thought they were worth in view of his costs, leading to an epiphany. “I decided I would no longer sell the vessel,” he said. “If you believe in my world, then you might get a vessel free. But believing in my world is a greater investment than the cost of a bowl.”"},{type:"text",value:"In 2004, Gates took an unpaid leave and traveled to Japan to attend a summer workshop in Tokoname, a coastal city in the central region and one of the country’s designated Six Ancient Kiln towns, with a nearly thousand-year ceramics history. He lived with a host family and learned from master potters. “I wouldn’t call it instruction, though instruction was part of it,” he said. “I got something more akin to what the Bible would call impartation, where it felt like I was touched or moved.” He added: “It was permission to be a better potter, and that’s really what I needed.”"},{type:"text",value:"In the United States, his instruction on ceramics history had privileged European and American decorative arts. Japan, to which he’d return many times, presented a rich ceramics tradition.

The potters Kanjiro Kawai and Shoji Hamada, who were key Mingei figures, embraced solid, rustic forms, local clays and natural glazes, and welcomed imperfections in the finished work."},{type:"text",value:"All of this gave Gates an idea that would prove pivotal for his own development as an artist. What if, he imagined, following World War II, a Japanese potter had found his way to the United States and landed in Mississippi, drawn to its soil and possibilities?

And it revealed Gates, suddenly, as a full-fledged conceptual artist, not averse to a little sleight of hand. Yet far from a gimmick, the story of Yamaguchi would blossom into a larger synthesis of Black and Japanese folk aesthetics that he now calls Afro-Mingei. “I imagined Yamaguchi as a speculative theory,” Gates told me.

It grew and eventually traveled — to the Park Avenue Armory in New York for a large, semipublic edition in 2019, and to the Serpentine Pavilion in London in 2022. But in Arles it tacked small again, with some 40-odd artists. Most were European, recommended by the London-based curators Jareh Das and Bianca A. Manu; several barely knew Gates at all. His underprogrammed spirit was back: loose scheduling, good meals, dancing. The French Ghanaian artist Eden Tinto Collins, attending BAR for the first time, told me the vibe felt like “\u003Cem>faire foyer\u003C/em>” — creating a hearth or home."},{type:"text",value:"At LUMA, Gates had set up a pottery workshop where he and a small team were making works in public to exhibit on-site — a kind of accumulative installation that would fill the hangarlike space by the show’s closing in early November.

There, at rosé hour, Gates gathered his guests to witness him unloading the anagama after its inaugural, seven-day-long firing. The kiln, 20 feet deep with an arched fire mouth, resembled a brick dragon. Gates, in blue workwear, sang a gospel tune as pots of various shapes came out, glazed by the ash in ocher, gray and green hues: “You who are weary, stop by the potter’s house. … The potter wants to put you back together again.” There were broken shards, too, which he extracted with equal reverence."},{type:"ad",value:{id:20,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"During the early years of Gates’s rise, his ceramics were largely unknown, eclipsed by his property acquisitions and works like “Civil Tapestries” — wall-mounted sculptures made from strips of decommissioned fire hoses — and his so-called tar paintings, created from roofing materials in homage to his father. Hoffmann, now a major patron, met him in 2013 at Art Basel, around his installation of a sloping wood surface covered with tar. “I saw him more as a carpenter, a roofer,” she told me. “I didn’t realize the ceramics thing. And then we went to Chicago and I understood.”"},{type:"text",value:"In fact, he had been making ceramics all along, including in his own anagama in Chicago.

You’re entering a free fall.” He added: “I’m after a world of rules. I want somebody to say, ‘Your tea bowl is too heavy, Theaster. You can trim a little bit more off the foot.

It was hot out, and the chef Masayo Funakoshi had sent up corn ice cream with tomato-infused orange blossom water, ricotta and lemon basil. Funakoshi had cooked a meal at BAR in Arles with the chef Armand Arnal; now she was preparing sweets for a tea ceremony to be held the next day inside Gates’s exhibition in Tokyo and led by Reijiro Izumi, an heir of the centuries-old Urasenke tea ceremony tradition.

Impossibilities. A modern Madame Blavatsky all dressed in gauze, trembling shadows, eyes like dark whirlpools. Instead, on that July day, after her assistant let me in, Welch ran up from her garden a creature of flesh and blood, wearing a prim prairie dress with flowers speckled all over it. She is tall — somewhere near 5-foot-10 — ardent and elegant, with long red Pre-Raphaelite hair and the strong-boned face of a medieval saint. She has an incredible vigor to her speech, which is frequently crowded with images. She was talking even before coming into the room and spoke nonstop for hours, thoughtfully, in loops and circuits; I only interjected a few times. With other people, being monologued at like this might have been hellish, but Welch was a little goofy, quite funny — her laugh is deep, sudden, frequent and startlingly loud. On multiple occasions during our hours together, she paced in excitement. Once she sped off upstairs to fetch something, coming down the staircase with such fast footsteps that I was briefly afraid she’d tumble the rest of the way."},{type:"text",value:"“Poems!” said Welch, flipping through the book I brought. “Great!” And then in a flash the book vanished, never to be seen again."},{type:"video",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopVideo",assetSlug:"100000009757181",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Video",bylines:[{creators:[{bioUrl:"https://www.nytimes.com/by/jerome-monnot",description:"",displayName:"Jerome Monnot",familyName:"",givenName:"",honorificPrefix:"",honorificSuffix:"",promotionalMedia:null,uri:"nyt://person/6d2da3c7-2f13-5bb6-b870-2cc04d6be7fe",url:"https://www.nytimes.com/by/jerome-monnot"}],prefix:"Video by",renderedRepresentation:"Video by Jerome Monnot"}],headline:{default:"My Favorite Song | Florence Welch"},lastMajorModification:"2024-10-17T13:46:37.786Z",lastModified:"2024-10-17T13:46:37.786Z",promotionalImage:{image:{altText:"",caption:{text:""},credit:"Jerome Monnot",crops:[{bleed:null,box:{x1:0,x2:3000,y1:0,y2:1687},name:"MASTER",renditions:[{height:337,name:"articleLarge",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-articleLarge.jpg",width:600},{height:576,name:"jumbo",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-jumbo.jpg",width:1024},{height:1152,name:"superJumbo",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-superJumbo.jpg",width:2048}]},{bleed:null,box:{x1:0,x2:3000,y1:0,y2:1687},name:"SIXTEEN_BY_NINE",renditions:[{height:338,name:"videoSixteenByNine600",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg",width:600}]},{bleed:null,box:{x1:0,x2:3000,y1:58,y2:1629},name:"FACEBOOK",renditions:[{height:550,name:"facebookJumbo",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-facebookJumbo.jpg",width:1050}]},{bleed:null,box:{x1:0,x2:3000,y1:0,y2:1687},name:"MOBILE_MASTER",renditions:[{height:1012,name:"mobileMasterAt3x",url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/t-magazine/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG/17tmag-greats-videos-slide-WOAG-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg",width:1800}]}],imageType:"photo",legacyHtmlCaption:"",original:{height:1687,width:3000},summary:"",type:"image"}},renditions:[{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:3700000,fileSize:"38469300",height:1080,type:"video_1080p_mp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_1080p.mp4",width:1920},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:12000000,fileSize:"126587489",height:1080,type:"syndication",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_hd_synd.mov",width:1920},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:2500000,fileSize:"26376579",height:720,type:"video_720p_mp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_720p.mp4",width:1280},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:1500000,fileSize:"16284171",height:480,type:"video_480p_mp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_480p.mp4",width:854},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:1500000,fileSize:"16912638",height:480,type:"video_480p_webm",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_480p.webm",width:854},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:900000,fileSize:"10252653",height:360,type:"video_360p_mp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_360p.mp4",width:640},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:300000,fileSize:"4259852",height:240,type:"video_240p_mp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg_240p.mp4",width:426},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:0,fileSize:"0",height:0,type:"hls",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/hls/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg/master.m3u8",width:0},{aspectRatio:"16:9",bitrate:0,fileSize:"0",height:0,type:"hlsfmp4",url:"https://vp.nyt.com/video/hlsfmp4/2024/10/11/127799_1_17tmag-florence-welch_wg/master.m3u8",width:0}],sourceId:"100000009757181",summary:"The singer on the Fleetwood Mac song that feels like riding a roller coaster.",uri:"nyt://video/c2fa3148-069e-5eab-a130-070388680550",url:"https://www.nytimes.com/video/t-magazine/100000009757181/my-favorite-song-florence-welch.html",mediaComponent:"VideoPlayer"},controls:false,muted:false,loop:false,autoplay:false}},{type:"text",value:"In fairness, a single book would be easily lost among the stuffed bookshelves everywhere in her house.

It allows her to change and grow in public. But it’s an equal source of confusion to critics, who’ve struggled to place her since the first of her five albums, 2009’s “Lungs.” Of course, no artist is truly sui generis — art is built out of other art — but it’s odd that Welch so confounds critics with her mix of soul and goth-punk and ethereal power ballads, as well as the way that she presents herself as closer kin to 1960s rock goddesses than to the hyperproduced pop stars of today, that the aforementioned critics have only rarely likened her to the musicians who’ve been her truest influences. Among these are Nick Cave, Patti Smith, Stevie Nicks, Tom Waits, Jeff Buckley, Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, whose live version of 1967’s “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ9n2_5mbig\">Try a Little Tenderness\u003C/a>” Welch watched obsessively on YouTube in her early 20s when she was teaching herself how to perform, his energy building as the song goes until, she said, “he just tears the stage apart.”"},{type:"text",value:"Perhaps it’s enough to say that Welch has one of the most distinctively powerful voices in popular music. My friend the 33-year-old performer Ganavya Doraiswamy, who’s trained in both jazz and South Asian devotional singing — the only other person I’ve ever met with a voice whose power and distinctiveness could match Welch’s — said that she has \u003Cem>uyir\u003C/em>, Tamil for “life breath,” in her voice, which Doraiswamy was trained to listen for as the soul of vocal art. “It sounds sometimes like [she] is singing to herself and we get to listen in, like we are privy to someone singing to themselves, and they’re making the world less unbearable,” she said. Uyir seems to be something like Federico García Lorca’s \u003Cem>duende\u003C/em>, of which the great Spanish poet said \u003Ca href=\"https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Spanish/LorcaDuende.php\">in a 1933 lecture\u003C/a>, “All that has dark sounds has duende. … The duende is a force not a labor, a struggle not a thought. I heard an old maestro of the guitar say: ‘The duende is not in the throat: the duende surges up, inside, from the soles of the feet.’ Meaning, it’s not a question of skill but of a style that’s truly alive: meaning, it’s in the veins: meaning, it’s of the most ancient culture of immediate creation.”"},{type:"text",value:"Uyir and duende may be lofty claims to make of a creator and performer of pop songs, but we have all been brainwashed to discount popular culture because of its very popularity, to believe that anything beloved by the masses is inherently lesser than esoteric art. This is a begging-the-question fallacy disproved all the time by great popular geniuses like Shakespeare, Mozart, Toni Morrison, Lorca himself. The music of Florence and the Machine is ubiquitous — the night before I left Florida for London, some stranger covered 2008’s “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOyfLBYtuU\">Dog Days Are Over\u003C/a>” at karaoke; the band’s 2011 “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbN0nX61rIs\">Shake It Out\u003C/a>” was piped over the loudspeakers while I waited for my plane in the airport — \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> it is excellent. It’s absurd to have to insist that both popularity and excellence can coexist."},{type:"text",value:"The music’s ubiquity is perhaps because of the fact that Florence and the Machine sound like nothing else out there in the musical landscape. It’s also, perhaps, because of the spooky vastness of Welch’s vision. Jack Antonoff, the 40-year-old producer and musician with whom Welch worked on her last album, 2022’s “Dance Fever,” said that she might be “literally clairvoyant.” And it’s true: Over and over, her songs predict the world to come. For instance, she wrote the lyrics for several of the album’s songs in 2019, including those of “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1VYwALPKE\">Choreomania\u003C/a>,” a song that Welch based on the 1518 dancing sickness in Strasbourg, where people actually danced until they died. The lyrics, with their frantic repetition of “Something’s coming, so out of breath” became prophetic when Covid-19 started spreading in 2020. “I didn’t know exactly what was coming,” Welch said, “but I knew it was dark.”"},{type:"ad",value:{id:21,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"Welch may not call herself spiritual, but the thing she kept pulling herself away from speaking about is the thing at the center of her, which she sometimes calls “the monster,” sometimes “the beast.” She struggles to control it, but it seems to be the source of her creative energy. “The beast is very good when it’s onstage. The monster is really useful and full of rage and glory and power,” she said. But as soon as she began talking about the beast, she grew agitated; it felt wrong. Her spiritual sense “doesn’t feel like something I should advertise, because it’s really sacred,” she told me, and changed the topic once more."},{type:"text",value:"When an oracle hears the voice of God and shares what she heard with others, she’s doing the same thing that an artist does while making art. Art is the alchemy by which grand abstractions become material. More than anything else, art requires the body of the artist, readied through time and practice and effort and some sort of innate spark, to become a sort of portal. Welch steps onstage and this portal is immediately available to her. To have the kind of transparency and vulnerability that allows such immediate access to the eternal, mysterious energy requires a great deal from the artist. Which is to say that art so powerful and immediate is demonic in its demands on the small, fleshly human that holds it."},{type:"image",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopImage",assetSlug:"100000009733908",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Image",altText:"A black-and-white portrait of Florence Welch wearing a large hat.",bylines:[],caption:{text:"Ferragamo dress, $5,000, ferragamo.com; Chanel hat, $4,500; and Welch’s own shawl."},credit:"Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

Welch was born like ordinary humans in August 1986; she’s currently 38. Her father, Nick Welch, is a former British advertising executive and, as his daughter called him, “bohemian”; he was the one who introduced her to bands like the Ramones and the Smiths when she was little. Through her mother’s specialty in Renaissance history, as well as family visits to ancient churches, Welch was deeply impressed as a child by the glorious, gory, vermilion-and-gold Catholic imagery, with its St. Sebastians pierced by arrows and St. Agathas with breasts on platters. She loved Greek mythology, she loved history. But nightmares plagued even her daylight hours, and her only escape from the monsters, ghosts and demons that her anxiety summoned was into books. Her mother wanted her to be an academic, but Welch was a daydreamer and had difficulty at school, having dyslexia, dyspraxia and something close to dyscalculia, and she would sneak out of the classroom to sing in the school hallways where the acoustics were good."},{type:"text",value:"Even when Welch was small, she had a Big Voice. She showed me a photo of herself as this little girl in a gingham dress, clutching a trophy for singing. The voice that “came out of that was oddly adult, sensual,” she said. Her mother was always yelling at her to shut up because she’d be singing at the top of her lungs while her mother was trying to write her books. It turns out that the Big Voice is as much a physiological gift as it is a vocation: Welch has a strong diaphragm, a large rib cage with huge lung capacity — which makes finding the vintage dresses that she loves tricky — as well as vocal cords of titanium. Once, fearing that she was losing her voice on tour, she went to see a specialist in Toronto, who looked down her throat only to respond, “Oh, yeah, your vocal cords are like a tank. You’re never gonna lose your voice,” she said. Music was the only thing she ever wanted to do, “Like, I will die if I don’t do it,” she said; singing was the companion that kept her from being alone with the terror. She longed to be in musical theater, but her mother was “the opposite of a stage mom,” Welch added dryly, and only reluctantly conceded to classical voice lessons. The singer trained in opera as a soprano and was only allowed to belt out a Disney song or show tune at the end of her lessons."},{type:"text",value:"The first time she appeared onstage, it was in a school performance of the musical “Bugsy Malone” (1976), and she blew everyone out of the water. “From a really young age, probably like 10, we knew that she was going to be really famous,” said her sister, Grace, who is younger than Welch by three years. (They have a brother, as well, and three stepsiblings.) Welch was hurt after their parents divorced when she was 10, the couple suffering from “simmering, silent resentment but no fights,” she said. She developed an eating disorder when she was a young adolescent. Then, when she was 14, she had her first taste of vodka and felt herself rise, transcendent, out of her anxieties. “Somehow alcohol allowed me to expand, to have freedom from the constraints of the body,” she said. “The first time I had hard spirits, it \u003Cem>felt\u003C/em> spiritual. I felt warm, I felt free, I felt at peace. It freed me from the relentlessness of thoughts.”"},{type:"subhed",value:{value:"All Welch wants is the grace that male performers get.

She bartended for a year after secondary school and got deeper into the “doomed Dickensian pirate ship,” as she described it, that was the South London music scene in the early 2000s, when rebellious young artists lived in squats. Welch, like the rest of them, drank to excess and screamed onstage in punk bands. She entered Camberwell College of Arts but dropped out after one year. As a teenager, she also experimented with folk, country and hip-hop-influenced rock. She got her first gig by singing in a nightclub bathroom — more good acoustics — and called her band the Machine after the nickname of one of its long-term members, Isabella Summers, who was a close co-writer, producer and collaborator on the first few albums but hasn’t been involved in the most recent ones. While still a teenager, Welch co-wrote the first song — the punk-pop “Kiss With a Fist” — that, after the band was signed in 2008, became big for them worldwide."},{type:"text",value:"“Lungs,” released the next year, is very much a first album, exuberant in its range of styles. “Dog Days Are Over” was the second single, and the first song that would contain everything that Welch’s music has become known for: intense and pure feeling; elliptical lyrics; strange, catchy drums; a tune that starts soft and builds into a great crescendo of sound. Again, critics didn’t get the album — they likened Welch to Fiona Apple, Kate Bush, Regina Spektor, Annie Lennox, Joanna Newsom, Sinead O’Connor, artists whose music has very little to do with one another’s but, well, they’re songwriters and women at the same time, so they must be similar! Some critics were weirdly condescending in their incomprehension: One wrote in Rolling Stone that the “best bits feel like being chased through a moonless night by a sexy moor witch,” which … what is that supposed to sound like? Screaming in terror while trying to run with an erection?"},{type:"text",value:"The pressure of new fame was so intense that the singer kept dancing with self-destruction. “In order to protect myself from the public gaze,” she said, “I shrank myself offstage.” When she and her band were working on what would become their first singles, her partying was so out of hand that she nearly blew it with the record company; she was too much of a liability, disappearing for three days into a bender and showing up at a pub mysteriously covered in blue paint. She was also in thrall to an eating disorder, a way to try to impose control on a life that felt uncontrollable. Grace became her personal assistant, and a great deal of the burden of the singer’s bad behavior fell on her. Grace loved her sister, looked up to her and now regrets bitterly how she enabled her. Welch lost days partying, blackout drunk, on drugs. Grace says now that the family has “this joke, like, ‘Thank God she was famous.’ She’s always been supercreative and supercomplicated and supertroubled, and if she didn’t have all that money and, like, a team of people propping her up in her 20s, she’d totally be dead.” Back then, Welch still lived at the family home in Camberwell; she’s an artist who needs to be rooted in place to make her art and hasn’t ever moved away from the neighborhood. Still, no matter how drunk or brutally hung over she was, she was always able to get up onstage and perform."},{type:"text",value:"There’s a rigid cycle in music making: One starts in the studio, creating the songs, which at this point with streaming are practically given away for free; to make money, one has to embark on a grueling two- to three-year schedule of performances, a lifestyle that lends itself easily to drugs and alcohol. Performing in massive venues is hugely physically taxing, particularly when one does it with Welch’s commitment. She throws her entire body into her songs, dances barefoot because she needs to feel the ground beneath her. She has twice broken her foot midway through her concerts but never stopped, instead singing through the pain. A great performer is something of an energy worker, creating a collective experience through her voice and body, and energy needs to be rebuilt before it’s expended again. She tried to control her alcoholism by not drinking when she was performing, but that was worse: She began to binge when she wasn’t on tour."},{type:"text",value:"In 2011, the band released the album “Ceremonials,” which Welch described as a “wall of sound, a wall of aesthetic,” a tumultuous wrestling with her addiction. “I was wandering around like a superhigh Gustav Klimt painting,” she said. The recurrent imagery is that of drowning; in the single “Shake It Out,” the line “It’s hard to dance with a devil on your back” repeats so often it becomes almost frantic."},{type:"ad",value:{id:22,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"Not long after, on the singer’s 27th birthday, her mother gave a moving speech, begging her daughter not to join the 27 Club, the group of tormented artists who’d died as a result of addiction, the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle and the radical exposure it requires to be an artist at that age: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain. Welch had shown up to her birthday party drunk and high. Perhaps because of the immensity of her shame, she smashed her whole face into her birthday cake."},{type:"text",value:"There was a moment in the months afterward, lying on the floor of her room, that Welch began to tell me about, saying that she was praying, “Help me, please help me, help me, help me,” but then she trailed off. One doesn’t speak about the holy. “It feels like a betrayal to the thing that helped me,” she said. In any event, after that night, Welch became sober."},{type:"text",value:"For a year, the singer was a “completely broken person,” she said. She’d always loved clothes, had delighted in her dresses onstage, but now she wore the same “horrible blue tracksuit” everywhere. Later on, she had treatment for her eating disorder. When I asked her what had taken the place of the addictions, she told me matter-of-factly, “The performance. The music.”"},{type:"text",value:"The albums that came afterward were a kind of resetting. For 2015’s “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful,” Welch had just been broken up with and had herself broken up with drugs and alcohol. As a result, the music was stripped down instrumentally, the cover image was black and white and onstage she wore a more masculine suit instead of her previous flowy dresses. Welch was, perhaps not coincidentally, taken more seriously as an artist. When Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters broke his leg and the band had to pull out of headlining the 2015 Glastonbury Festival, Florence and the Machine were asked to replace them. She began to write more poetry. In 2018, Florence and the Machine released “High as Hope,” which is even more stripped down and intimate, with Welch’s poetry becoming its lyrics."},{type:"text",value:"In addition to her albums, the singer has been working for eight years on a musical version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel, “The Great Gatsby,” called “Gatsby: An American Myth,” which I saw in June at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. She was drawn to the book, she said, by the drunkenness and hangover in it, the doomed romanticism, “the way the page sings.” The show got a standing ovation. I thought it was fine. At times, everything was so on the nose that I felt I was being hit with a soft right hook. The set is half nightclub, half car crash, just like the Roaring Twenties; all the characters’ costumes have dirty hems, as though to semaphore that none of them have quite risen above the muck of the American dream. The music is a collaboration between Welch and Thomas Bartlett, who, in addition to being a co-producer and co-writer on some songs on Florence and the Machine’s “High as Hope,” is a gifted musician who’s worked with everyone from Nico Muhly to Yoko Ono and Sufjan Stevens. The songs they made are excellent and surprising, with exciting and slithery Jazz Age rhythms. But art gets in trouble when it becomes polemical, which many of the songs were. I began to wonder if a musical would ever be the right vehicle for a story like “The Great Gatsby.” Musical theater is the most American art form that exists, all dazzle and jazz hands, but Fitzgerald’s novel draws its power from the lightness of its allusions. Things that are hinted at in the book — like Nick Carraway’s crush on Jay Gatsby, or Gatsby’s gangster past — get their own numbers. That said, songs are still being made and discarded. The version I saw, which might one day move to Broadway, hadn’t settled into its final form, and it’s a sin to judge art before it’s finished."},{type:"text",value:"Welch’s most recent album, “Dance Fever,” is my favorite; I played it so often that my younger son began to call it “Mommy’s church.” I find it almost unbearably beautiful, a confirmation that Welch’s songwriting keeps getting more powerful. She had already written the first two songs — “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62LtChAwww\">King\u003C/a>” and “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8kUKuLBaU\">Free\u003C/a>” — and was in the studio in New York City in March 2020 with Antonoff when the pandemic hit, and they had to flee to their respective corners. The rest of the songs arrived as Welch’s anxiety spiraled in her London home, the project something of a diary of those years of isolation. Listening now, it feels like a wild, anxious, terrified, hedonistic catharsis of that awful time, a ritual cleansing of the collective grief that we still haven’t fully processed as a culture."},{type:"image",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopImage",assetSlug:"100000009733895",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Image",altText:"A portrait of Florence Welch wearing a sequined dress with her hair blowing in the air.",bylines:[],caption:{text:"Louis Vuitton dress, price on request, louisvuitton.com; and Welch’s own dress (worn underneath) and jewelry."},credit:"Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

The turn-of-the-20th-century portraits were huge and dramatic and vividly emotional, the rooms thickly crowded. I said I loved the subjects’ expressions; Sargent was a master of distilling character in the subtle look on a face. “I love the fashion,” Welch responded and gestured at “Portrait of Miss Elsie Palmer” (1889-90), depicting a young American girl with reddish hair and bangs like Welch’s, wearing a layered pale pink dress with a pleated underskirt and bodice, her waist tightly cinched."},{type:"text",value:"As we walked, astonishment took hold in me that nobody seemed to recognize the superstar beside me. I’d been sure we’d be so swarmed that I’d had fantasies I’d have to double as a bodyguard, fending fans off with my enormous Muji notebook. But no one did, despite the fact that Welch was on such a state of hyperalert that, when I once tried to take a photo of a stunning Sargent dress on a dummy and her head happened to be in the frame, she swiveled so fast toward me and gave me a look of such searing disdain that I felt flayed. The monster had risen up in her face for a moment. It was terrifying."},{type:"text",value:"Perhaps people in crowds at art museums are deeply unobservant of those around them, only anxious to see the works on the wall; perhaps it was because, with her pale, thin elegance and her feminine dress — delicate flowers on a green field, discreet ruffles and a filigree of off-white lace — she looked as though she were herself a Sargent subject stepping out of the frame. Most likely, however, it was because Welch has built such a powerful public image, a glamorous pagan priestess hologram, that the human person behind it simply didn’t square. Maybe her fans didn’t recognize her because the performer is a giantess and the person is merely person-size."},{type:"text",value:"The image of Florence and the Machine is a curious thing. It’s intricate and carefully constructed, vivid and clear in its referents and set intentionally outside of the contemporary moment, which allows the singer to change and refine the way she presents herself to the world. She seized on it early, after some industry people’s unhappy experiments with trying to market the young singer-songwriter in miniskirts and high-heeled shoes. But she couldn’t sell sex. “I’ve always looked like a haunted painting,” she said, and it’s true that, though she’s beautiful, a bad photograph would show her features as harsh, stern. She also didn’t \u003Cem>want\u003C/em> to sell sex: “I wanted to be scary when I was younger, not sexy.”"},{type:"text",value:"To refuse to do so was intentional; it was also lucky. A female artist who’s marketed as sexy must stay at the same level of sexy even as she ages, which is increasingly hard to do, what with gravity and slipping hormones and the frankly fascinating processes of living beyond the body’s natural fertility. Britney Spears will never not exist in the public imagination as a nubile teen in a schoolgirl kilt. Dolly Parton is closing in on 80 with the same blond bouffant and enhanced breasts that she once, at an awards ceremony, called “Shock” and “Awe.” I’d never judge any performer for using her sexuality to sell records; trying to sell art at all is a grind, particularly at the beginning of one’s career, and if the universe has given you a gift of such reach and power, it would be difficult not to use it. But this form of beauty is something of a gilded cage, a safe place for a little time, though also a trap that a woman can’t escape."},{type:"image",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopImage",assetSlug:"100000009733904",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Image",altText:"Florence Welch, wearing a brown dress, stands with her hands extended.",bylines:[],caption:{text:"Chloé dress, $6,490, and dress (worn underneath), $3,990, chloe.com; and Welch’s own crown, shawl and jewelry."},credit:"Photograph by Luis Alberto Rodriguez.

From the stage, she can look out on a sea of bloody prairie maidens with flower crowns, mermaids with sharp teeth, weeping martyrs, witches in purple silken cloaks, Jesus, tattered ghosts, all images from her songs and videos. Autumn de Wilde, 54, first directed Welch in the 2018 music video for “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kIrRooQwuk\">Big God\u003C/a>,” which is shot as though in outer space, on a stark black stage in a shining one-inch pool of water pierced with high-contrast light. As Welch sings, the dancers’ colorful veils darken as they get wet, then are discarded, until at last Welch levitates the dancers with her voice. “Given the opportunity,” de Wilde said, “if you put her in any world, she will make it iconic and gigantic. You can’t have that without her vulnerability.” The Florence and the Machine aesthetic draws from Pre-Raphaelite tawny goddesses; photos by the 19th-century artist Julia Margaret Cameron; Surrealist 20th-century paintings by Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo; the modern dancer Loie Fuller; exhausted cancan dancers; pastel moths. All come from the same spiritual universe, as dark as true fairy tales tend to be, confections of extreme beauty with neon venom laced through."},{type:"text",value:"It wasn’t until I spoke with de Wilde that I changed my mind about Welch’s image; at first I thought she wielded it like a shield, meaning that she’d constructed it purely to protect the fragility beneath. After, I saw it was something of a seashell, all spikes, dazzling colors, mother-of-pearl gleam. Both shield and shell are created in order to protect the tender flesh within, but a shield is the result of a huge amount of human labor, mining and refining and beating of the hot metal, and a shell is a natural emanation of the beast that builds it. Florence and the Machine is the singer’s true self, but writ large, her imagination allowed freedom to play. The child who spent hours gazing at the light in her room has taken her visions of monsters and saints and demons and graces and made them real."},{type:"text",value:"One of the final portraits at the Sargent show was the well-known “Ellen Terry as Lady MacBeth” (1889), the actress bloody mouthed, with long red braids to her knees, wearing a shining green-and-gold dress, placing a crown upon her head. “We drew on this painting a lot to build our look for ‘Dance Fever,’” Welch told me quietly, smiling."},{type:"text",value:"At this — seeing the queen, her face become a stark mask of ambition — I had a powerful moment of déjà vu. I thought of the lyrics to “King,” when, at the beginning, Welch sings in a low register: “We argue in the kitchen about whether to have children / about the world ending, and the scale of my ambition / And how much art is really worth / The very thing you’re best at is the thing that hurts the most.”"},{type:"text",value:"Christ on a stick! Show me another popular song that speaks in such a compact way of such vast things: the moral burden of bringing children into the Anthropocene, huge ambition in a female artist, how it’s all complicated when one considers a baby’s hijacking of the body for 40 weeks — and beyond, if the mother is nursing. There are so few examples of female musicians who were able to uphold a rigorous touring schedule after they’d had children that Welch and I could only think of one: Beyoncé. Exacerbating the mixed craving for and fear of having a baby and what it would mean for her art, Welch feels the intense pressure of aging as a female performer. “At 40, what are you supposed to do? Die?” she asked, then laughed darkly. “King” goes on to insist, “I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king.” She isn’t a queen, accessory to power; she’s power itself. “I was also thinking of the King of Rock,” Welch said, referring to Elvis Presley; she was thinking of the right of male artists to let their art be separate from the body, to let the art be so central that everything else is peripheral. In the latter part of the song, Welch raises her voice in a long howl of rage. Maybe I revel in her work because so much of it is simply overflowing with rage, her perfect voice embodying all that subsumed rage that I swallow every day and allowing it to bloom out into the world, a gorgeous shining pitch-black flower."},{type:"text",value:"All Welch wants is the grace that male performers get. The grace to age in public; the grace to put art at the center of one’s life and not have to be a woman or a mother first. If the universe gives an artist the nearly unlimited ability to become a conduit to the astonishing eternal mysteries, what a grinding check to her momentum when she bumps up against human-imposed boundaries of misogyny. How much worse must be the body’s own betrayal! How enraging that, even as an artist earns more wisdom and depth and artistry — begins to understand how to pull the uncanny powers of the beyond down into constant display on the earth — the body begins to lose its vital energy, and the cost of being alive begins to wear you down."},{type:"text",value:"Art begins in the body; art is limited by the limitations of the body; at some point, art exceeds the body and can live beyond the scope of flesh. I watched Welch look deeply at the gothic, gory Sargent painting of Ellen Terry, and I saw — or imagined I saw — the beast in her surfacing for a moment, hungry for the magic that Sargent enacted on his subjects, allowing them to be fully seen, to be held in the brightest of colors, to be shown to the world eternal in the moment of their greatest glory. Among the many other things Welch refuses to be defined by, she refuses to be defined by time. The tragedy of the Cumean Sibyl, according to the ancient Roman poet Ovid, was that, though the god Apollo did cede to her pleas to give her life beyond the scope of the mortal span, over a thousand years her body shrank until only her voice remained. This is the fate of all artists. All have to come to terms with it at some point. Welch, preternaturally gifted as she is, isn’t exempt."},{type:"text",value:"But until then, oh, you gods who power her, oh, you humans who make her life hum, just let the woman sing."},{type:"text",value:{value:"Hair by Anthony Turner at Jolly Collective.

By the time of her first solo exhibition in New York, at Just Above Midtown gallery in 1986, she had already begun to change the language of photography, creating a body of conceptual works that are often characterized by a combination of imagery and text. Sometimes she’d photograph braided hair against a black surface, including spare text panels that read “tug” or “weave.” “Waterbearer,” from 1986, is a black-and-white photograph of a Black woman in a white shift dress viewed from behind. She’s holding a pitcher in one hand and a plastic jug in the other, with water spilling out of both.

It was the spring of 2023, and the fashion designer was watching a playback on a monitor at Cinecittà, the film studio on the outskirts of Rome where he and the director Luca Guadagnino had been working on an adaptation of “Queer,” the autobiographical novel by William S. Burroughs, written in the 1950s but published three decades later. Anderson, the Northern Irish creative director of Loewe and the founder of his own clothing line, JW Anderson, was overseeing the costumes. The two friends had worked together before on Guadagnino’s “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/movies/challengers-review-zendaya-mike-faist-josh-oconnor.html\">Challengers\u003C/a>” (2024), about a love triangle set in the world of competitive tennis, but their second feature collaboration, which follows a gay American expat, played by Daniel Craig, from midcentury Mexico City into the Ecuadorean jungle on a search for ayahuasca, was more ambitious, requiring period clothing for hundreds of actors and extras. As they reviewed the footage, Anderson, who had stepped into the frame to fix something on Craig’s costume, realized that he’d been captured onscreen. What he saw disturbed him. The prodigy with tousled blond hair who’d started his brand in 2008 at age 23 had been replaced by a man on the verge of middle age. But it wasn’t just that he looked somewhat disheveled: Anderson had been so busy working that he’d lost track of time. “I was like, who \u003Cem>is\u003C/em> that person?” he recalls thinking. “And what have I done in the last 10 years?”"},{type:"text",value:"On a crisp morning this past February, Anderson is recounting the experience in his townhouse in the East London borough of Hackney. Although he’s warm and self-mocking, he gives the impression that he’s never not at least a little on edge. “When you’re working all the time, you end up being addicted to the next show,” he says. “You’re so busy outdoing yourself that you don’t realize what you’ve done.” The early light cuts across a Le Corbusier stool, a white linen sofa by Axel Vervoordt and a pair of Georgian-style yellow armchairs in the living room. “You’re trying to be a normal person,” he adds. “And people are expecting you to be happy all the time and have an idea. But sometimes you just don’t.”"},{type:"text",value:"Anderson’s restlessness seems particularly intense right now, perhaps because it’s the year he turns 40, or because, despite having more than a few fears, the thing that scares him most is feeling truly seen. “I’m more of a voyeur,” he says. “I’ve never wanted to be like, ‘Here I am!’” And yet, for the past couple of years, it’s been difficult to avoid hearing his name or Loewe’s, which, until quite recently, most people probably couldn’t pronounce. (In 2018, the brand \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOL4fD3kUdg\">released a video\u003C/a> of models struggling to get it right; it’s “Lo-WEH-vay,” the actor and filmmaker Dan Levy tells his co-star Aubrey Plaza in \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihIZVg1-ztM\">a recent promotional short\u003C/a>.) In February of last year, Anderson was in a motel in the Arizona desert dressing Rihanna for her Super Bowl halftime show. The performer, who used the occasion to announce her second pregnancy, wore a red Loewe boiler suit and leather breastplate. A few months later, Beyoncé kicked off her Renaissance World Tour in a bespoke Loewe bodysuit embellished with strategically placed sequined hands. And this past spring, the “Challengers” press tour felt like one long fashion show, with all three lead actors — Mike Faist, Josh O’Connor and Zendaya — wearing Loewe outfits, including, in Zendaya’s case, shoes made from 3-D-printed tennis balls. “Actors are strange people in a good way,” says Anderson, who once trained to be one himself. “They’re like vessels. You can pour in whatever you want.”"},{type:"text",value:"The same might be said of his clothes. If some designers have become famous for introducing a new silhouette or landing on a signature look and then finding countless ways to reiterate it, Anderson has a reputation for being more mercurial. With each collection, he’s either adding a new layer to an existing idea (a mesh slip dress with a balloon motif one season; shoes made of real balloons the next) or rejecting it outright. His take on fashion isn’t exactly theatrical — some of the garments can be quite subtle — but his clothes tend to come with an element of performance. As the actress Greta Lee, who has appeared in multiple Loewe campaigns, says, Anderson’s creations have a way of activating “an elevated version of your essence.”"},{type:"text",value:"Two days from now, he’ll present his fall 2024 JW Anderson women’s collection at a gymnasium in London’s Marylebone neighborhood. “The show we’re working on is very British woman in suburbia,” says Anderson, who’s in the process of rejecting his louder recent offerings and the attention they received. “When it gets too much, my natural reaction is to go for a silent year.” As he sets down a pot of coffee on an 18th-century oak dining table in his kitchen, he makes a face that reappears, not infrequently, whenever he’s feeling agitated: a look of dread cut with a smile, a sort of breaking of the fourth wall that indulges his neuroses while also attempting to undermine them."},{type:"text",value:"In conversation, Anderson can be an exuberant and compelling catastrophizer, and the more time one spends observing him, the more one starts to feel that his own relationship to fashion might be read as a kind of performance, too: At the end of his runway shows, when he emerges to take a bow, it’s always with his head down and shoulders slumped, almost as if he’s been forced into receiving applause. Designers, he once told me, are “kind of biblically hated,” and his view of the entire industry can seem equally bleak, even if he’s stating it for effect: The magazines that once held such sway are increasingly irrelevant; connoisseurship is dead; everything is generic. But rather than dispirit him, all of this only pushes him to fight harder. “I feel like we’re in this amazing moment where it’s going to be survival of the fittest,” he says. His voice has intensified into a high-pitched whisper, every word delivered as if it were part of a lurid blind item. He smiles again."},{type:"text",value:"His ambition is clear: He’s determined to become the world’s best living fashion designer. What’s sometimes murkier is why he wants this. “I’m sure people would say that I’m arrogant,” he says. His goals, though, are simple and practical. “Bag sales need to get to here; the stores need to be like this. But these are just actions,” he says. “The big thing is, ‘What am I getting out of it creatively?’” Another question might be: How long can he keep it all up?"},{type:"scoopslideshow",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopSlideshow",assetSlug:"100000009731261",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Slideshow",bylines:[],headline:{default:"TK"},lastMajorModification:"2024-10-02T16:31:36.407Z",lastModified:"2024-10-02T16:31:36.407Z",promotionalImage:{image:{altText:"A model poses in an oversized green, grey and black parka and yellow boots.",caption:{text:"Loewe viscose circular-sleeve parka and lambskin bracelet ankle boots from the fall 2021 women’s collection."},credit:"Photograph by Johnny Dufort.

When the French conglomerate, which also has a stake in JW Anderson, fully acquired Loewe in 1996, clothing was responsible for about 10 percent of sales, which hovered around $200 million. For four years beginning in 1997, the American designer Narciso Rodriguez repositioned it as a ready-to-wear label, delivering simple, sellable clothes. Later, the British designer Stuart Vevers would shift the company’s focus back to handbags. So, unlike Saint Laurent or Gucci — where, some have speculated, Anderson might one day end up — Loewe was a bit of a blank slate. There wasn’t much of a heritage to adhere to, and Anderson started running it as if he were operating an experimental gallery, presenting customers with things they didn’t know they wanted and couldn’t quite understand. His debut women’s collection for the brand, held in an Isamu Noguchi-designed sculpture garden outside of the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in June 2014, featured baggy leather pants in pale blue and bright yellow, macramé halter tops and latex T-shirts with a mallard motif. In the years since, he’s become an uncanny illusionist, producing trompe l’oeil garments and incorporating surprising materials — from makeup brushes to sink drain covers — that can feel almost like sleights of hand or, as one critic put it, “decidedly normal things made abnormal.” At his spring 2016 women’s show, he sent models out in pants covered with shards of mirrored glass; his spring 2023 women’s collection included dresses with bodices shaped like anthuriums. His interests, which are communicated through each garment, are varied. “He can discuss an inspiration trip to Naples — and, like, napkins — forever,” says Lee. “You could be talking about [the pop star] Charli XCX and then he’ll be like, ‘Look at this amazing Venetian artifact I found,’” says the actress and writer Ayo Edebiri. “The problem with the world,” Anderson says, “is that there are so many things to discover.”"},{type:"text",value:"A decade in, Anderson has transformed the formerly sleepy Spanish label into one of fashion’s noisiest and most innovative hype machines — and, frankly, its most meme-able — almost single-handedly reinvigorating red-carpet showmanship and shaping online fashion discourse more than maybe any other designer of his generation. Some of the clothes almost seem to project hostility toward the enterprise at hand — models have struggled to walk in molded Plasticine shorts; one floor-length dress, pierced at the neck with a giant sewing pin, felt more like a dare than an outfit — but there’s a playfulness to them, too. Plaza, known for her deadpan humor, says she felt “spiritually connected” to the “soft, buttery gown with an aggressive spear cutting through it” that she wore this past January for the 2023 Emmys."},{type:"ad",value:{id:23,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"According to Anderson, Loewe is now a roughly $2 billion business. (He wants to grow the company to $3 billion. It’s “really American of me,” he says.) In his ability to make clothes that are both avant-garde and commercial, Anderson has something in common with Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese designer of Comme des Garçons. Pieter Mulier, the Belgian creative director of the brand Alaïa, says that the two designers also share a sense of modesty. “The public doesn’t know much about Jonathan’s private life,” says Mulier, who lives near Anderson in Paris. “And I think that’s much more respectable than, let’s say, the older generation, where designers were nearly as big as the brands they worked for.” Describing her first impression of Anderson, Lee says, “This sounds kind of insulting, but he was so \u003Cem>normal\u003C/em>,” and compares his look (he’s almost always in jeans and a T-shirt) to that of a “hot fraternity brother” from a Midwestern college. “He’s not one of those reclusive artists who’s in his own cave.”"},{type:"text",value:"Levy, Anderson’s friend, says, “In an industry where test audiences and algorithms dictate a lot of what we do creatively, he’s somehow managed to work within the system but challenge it at the same time.” The Scottish stylist Joe McKenna, an early supporter of Anderson’s work, says, “The clothes weren’t repeating an idea, but you believed [they were] from the same hand as the previous collections you’d seen. A bit like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/19/t-magazine/miuccia-prada-fashion.html\">Miuccia Prada\u003C/a>, he’s constantly rummaging through his own language box to pull out new things.” Also like Prada, a hero and former employer of his, he’s more interested in exploring different materials and fabrication techniques than in creating another pretty dress. (Whether a garment is flattering is often beside the point — awkwardness, if not the goal, is encouraged.) “For some people, their drug is the idea of continuity,” he says. “That is not my drug. We have bags for that.”"},{type:"text",value:"But not everyone can pull off a stiletto with a cracked-egg heel (spring 2022) or a coat and shoes sprouting living grass (spring 2023), and Anderson also designs things for clients who aren’t quite so bold: The Loewe Puzzle, a handbag introduced in 2014 and made by jigsawing together geometric pieces of leather, has become the brand’s answer to the Hermès Birkin or Fendi Baguette; in 2022, a padded Loewe bomber jacket, shaped a bit like a leather-wrapped Hershey’s Kiss, sold out after Kendall Jenner posted a photo of herself wearing a green one. There are few designers who can exploit the internet so deftly: This past June, days after someone on social media described an heirloom tomato as being “so Loewe,” Anderson revealed a red leather Loewe handbag that looked much like the fruit in question. In 2022, the night before her album “Crash” came out, Charli XCX was photographed carrying the JW Anderson Bumper, a rectangular shoulder bag outlined with tubular padding; two months later, she became the face of the accessory. “The reason he’s able to attract all these different creative people,” she says, is because he’s one of them."},{type:"text",value:"Designers have a long history of collaborating with artists, but what separates Anderson, who identifies as a snob, from some of his peers is that he’s genuinely curious about objects and other art forms, and deeply knowledgeable about the references he deploys in his work. A compulsive collector of art, he’s kept a portrait of a man sitting on a chair, by the mid-20th-century American photographer Peter Hujar, next to his bed in London; a large assortment of his other works — many of them by gay artists, including 1940s photographs of male nudes by George Platt Lynes and a 1960s Paul Thek wax-and-steel sculpture that resembles hunks of meat — will eventually reside at a house he’s been building in North London."},{type:"text",value:"In 2016, Anderson, who’s also a trustee on the board of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, inaugurated the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, an annual award recognizing excellence among potters, textile artists and other makers. (The latest recipient was the Mexican-born ceramist Andrés Anza.) Over the years, he’s reinterpreted the work of other underappreciated or overlooked gay artists, including \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/arts/design/joe-brainard-tibor-de-nagy.html\">Joe Brainard\u003C/a>, an informal member of the New York School in the 1960s, whose collages of pansies were printed on shirts and woven into cardigans for Loewe’s fall 2021 men’s collection; the homoerotic Finnish illustrator \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/t-magazine/tom-of-finland.html\">Tom of Finland\u003C/a>, whose estate has partnered with JW Anderson on a few occasions; and the American artist and AIDS activist \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/magazine/the-rage-and-tenderness-of-david-wojnarowiczs-art.html\">David Wojnarowicz\u003C/a>, who died of complications from the disease in 1992 and whose work, including “Untitled (One Day This Kid … )” (1990-91), was repurposed for a clutch and a custom suit with ballooning sleeves worn by Levy at the 2021 Met Gala, which was dedicated that year to American fashion."},{type:"text",value:"A cynical reading of Anderson’s work might accuse him of cultural vampirism: By positioning himself alongside history’s great embattled artists, he makes his own output feel all the more subversive. But there’s a delicateness to his approach; few designers, if any, care or know enough to challenge the artists they’re working with to try something new. The 82-year-old American artist \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/13/t-magazine/lynda-benglis-art-greats.html\">Lynda Benglis\u003C/a>, famous for her wax paintings and poured latex sculptures — and whose massive fountains dominated the set of the spring 2024 Loewe men’s show — ended up designing jewelry for the brand. The Los Angeles-based artist \u003Ca href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/seeing-things-richard-hawkinss-haunted-houses/\">Richard Hawkins\u003C/a>, 63, whose collages of young heartthrobs, often either bloodied or sexualized, adorned sweatpants, beaded leather bags and knitted tunics for Loewe’s fall 2024 men’s collection, was skeptical when he was asked to collaborate. His concern, he says, was that his work would be reduced to “coffee cups and mouse pads.” Instead, Anderson added another dimension to Hawkins’s pinup universe, inviting the artist to create video works for the show featuring actors such as Jamie Dornan and Manu Rios, who sat nearby in the front row. He and Anderson included at least one actor with an OnlyFans page, but Hawkins says he was told to avoid depictions of masturbation. “I think Jonathan pushes [LVMH] as far as they’ll go when it comes to sexuality and queerness.”"},{type:"scoopslideshow",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopSlideshow",assetSlug:"100000009720198",breakpointName:void

WEEKS LATER, I arrive at the Loewe offices in Paris’s Ninth Arrondissement. When we last met, in London before the fall 2024 JW Anderson show — which ended up telegraphing an uneasy vision of English nostalgia, with models, some of them in curly gray wigs, wearing stodgy underwear and minidresses made from skeins of knitting wool — Anderson was edgy but focused, maybe even a little cocky. Now, three days after his fall 2024 women’s show for Loewe, he seems ready to murder someone."},{type:"text",value:"“After a show, you don’t want to be near me,” he warns, smoking next to an open window on a cloudy afternoon in March. The Loewe collection, which offered a quirky take on aristocratic style with morning coats embroidered with tiny caviar beads and a crepe jersey shift dress with a blurry tartan motif, had been a success. (One of the three fashion critics whom he pays much attention to called the show “great” and “inspiring.”) But he’s standing next to his antique wooden desk — uncluttered except for a white vase of Creamsicle-hued buttercups and a mug with a drawing on it of a five-man orgy — trying not to explode. Before the pandemic, Anderson would fly to Miami or Argentina after his final show of the season; this year, he stayed in Paris with his boyfriend, the Catalan artist Pol Anglada, 33, with whom he frequently collaborates, succumbing to what he describes as nonverbal “death spirals.” That some of his fellow designers had gotten similar praise for work that Anderson sees as inferior to his — “You can’t just fake a formula”; “It’s the same product”; “It looked like Neiman Marcus” — infuriates him, as if the approval is meaningless when it’s not only his to receive."},{type:"text",value:"As energized as he is by winning, Anderson feels like there’s no one to outdo. “I’m looking out there and there’s nothing,” he says. When that happens, he creates his own challenges. With “Queer,” for example, he decided that the cast would wear almost exclusively vintage clothing from the 1940s and ’50s. (“Down to my boxer briefs,” says the actor Drew Starkey, who plays Craig’s love interest. “It was nerve-racking,” says Craig. “If you spill coffee all over the suit, it’s ruined.”) One of the few times Anderson was jealous of someone else’s work — “It’s so amazing when you see a show and you’re like, ‘\u003Cem>Damn it\u003C/em>,’” he says — was in 2021, when \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/13/t-magazine/demna-balenciaga-greats.html\">Demna\u003C/a>, the provocative creative director of Balenciaga, came out with his first couture collection. “I thought it was groundbreaking in terms of proportion and silhouette and nostalgia and non-nostalgia and angst,” he says, “and what couture could mean.”"},{type:"text",value:"Andrew Webster, an old friend of Anderson’s and the brand image director at JW Anderson, says, “Jonathan is an overworker, to the point where, even if we’re all fatigued and exhausted, he’s like, ‘I’ve got another idea.’” Unlike many members of his generation, Anderson doesn’t feel a compunction to find \u003Cem>something\u003C/em> nice to say about others’ efforts in the office. More than once, he’s interrupted a design meeting to tell the team that “everything’s a disaster”; he’s also been known to scrap social media posts and entire campaigns. The French stylist Benjamin Bruno, one of Anderson’s most trusted creative partners, admits that they’ve had some “extremely fiery and dramatic” disagreements over the years. “If you don’t argue,” says Bruno, “it means you don’t care.”"},{type:"text",value:"Each year, Anderson releases a total of eight runway collections for Loewe and JW Anderson, traveling between Paris and London. While it’s rare for a designer who runs a business the size of Loewe to still have their own label with a fully realized identity and fan base — Anthony Vaccarello suspended his brand after being hired at Saint Laurent in 2016; the late Virgil Abloh kept Off-White going following his Louis Vuitton appointment, but he didn’t design women’s wear there — Anderson treats JW Anderson as a kind of creative laboratory. If Loewe is eccentric and unpredictable, JW Anderson can feel downright volatile. The same year that a Loewe dress was structured into a car shape, BMX handlebars and broken skateboards were incorporated into JW Anderson tops and sweaters. “This is someone who has something quite bold to say,” \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/t-magazine/matthieu-blazy-bottega-veneta-inspirations.html\">Matthieu Blazy\u003C/a>, Bottega Veneta’s creative director, recalls thinking after attending one of Anderson’s shows. “If you really want to push the boundaries of clothing,” says Anderson, “you have to be a bit obsessive.”"},{type:"text",value:"IN A WAY, Anderson was raised to win. He was born in 1984 in Magherafelt, a small town in Northern Ireland, during the Troubles, the sectarian conflict that lasted from the late 1960s to 1998 between the largely Protestant unionists, who wanted the province to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the mostly Roman Catholic nationalists, who wanted to secede. His mother, Heather, taught high school English. His father, Willie, was a star rugby player. (To this day, Webster, who describes the Anderson clan as “salt-of-the-earth people,” says, “It’s a very slow journey if you’re out with Willie because everyone wants to chat with him or buy him a drink.”) Before heading off to school, Anderson would check underneath the car for bombs. “I was so lucky that I grew up in that because [it makes] you realize you can lose everything in a heartbeat,” he says."},{type:"ad",value:{id:24,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"As a teenager, Anderson, who has an older brother, Thomas, now the operations director of JW Anderson, and a younger sister, Chloe, would trawl the racks of a local department store for dead-stock Jean Paul Gaultier. “In Ireland, the idea of standing out is a very unusual thing,” says Anderson, who nonetheless belongs to a long line of eccentrics who grew up there; like Oscar Wilde and Francis Bacon, who were antagonized or jailed for being gay, he’s learned how to wield his wit like a weapon. “Sometimes you can only reflect on how amazing a country is by getting out,” he says. “[James] Joyce had to leave Ireland to write about it.” At 18, Anderson relocated for a couple of years to Washington, D.C., to study performance at the Studio Acting Conservatory. Although his parents were supportive, he recalls their telling him, “Do what you want. Just don’t spend money you don’t have.”"},{type:"text",value:"Back in Northern Ireland, Anderson was kind of a loner, but in Dupont Circle, the gay neighborhood where he was living in the basement of a George Stumpf-style townhouse, he felt like everyone was his best friend. Instead of focusing on honing his craft, Anderson says, “it was literally Girl Gone Wild.” Within a week of being there, he’d started drinking and smoking. On one occasion, he went to a party in Baltimore for what he thought was one night; only afterward did he come to realize that three days had passed. “I’d gone from being this polite child to being a mental person,” he says."},{type:"text",value:"A couple of years later, Anderson, who’d run out of money, returned to Ireland. He moved into a rental apartment in Dublin with Willie, who had been commuting from home to coach the Leinster rugby team. (“My dad was only there two days a week,” says Anderson with a smirk. And at that point, “I know \u003Cem>exactly\u003C/em> who I am.”) He got a job as a sales associate in the men’s wear department at a clothing store. It was an exciting time in men’s fashion: Tom Ford was doubling down on louche glamour for Gucci; Hedi Slimane had been proposing a new superskinny silhouette at Dior Homme. After work, Anderson would borrow outfits to wear clubbing and hope that no one accidentally burned them with a cigarette; one assumes that even if they had, he’d have put the garments back on the rack the next morning."},{type:"text",value:"Eventually, when the luster of late nights had mostly worn off, he put together what he calls “a weird mood board of stuff” and applied to various universities. The one school that accepted him was London College of Fashion. Between classes, he worked as a visual merchandiser under Manuela Pavesi, Miuccia Prada’s close friend and trusted colleague, at Prada. Pavesi, who died in 2015, liked to wear pajamas with diamonds; knowing this, Anderson arrived for his interview in a vintage paisley dressing gown that he’d cut above the knee — “almost sort of slutty,” says Webster, who would become his manager at Prada — with tight Dior jeans underneath and a pair of Prada boots. While they were working on a window display one day, Webster recalls, Anderson disappeared; he later found the designer on the street, wearing a long coat covered with accessories that he’d designed, getting his picture taken for i-D magazine. “Jonathan was always a bit of an opportunist, really,” says Webster, later adding, “He has this ability to wrap you up into his orbit, and you’re not quite sure how you got there sometimes, but you’re in it.”"},{type:"scoopslideshow",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopSlideshow",assetSlug:"100000009720430",breakpointName:void

presented his graduate collection — which he describes as “woeful” and “the most ridiculous” — at a London nightclub in 2005; the cabaret star Justin Vivian Bond, in an ermine stole and a headpiece made from netting and plastic flies, sang as the models came down the runway. (Anderson and Webster still play the recording of Bond and Kenny Mellman’s 2004 show at Carnegie Hall, “Kiki and Herb Will Die for You,” on a loop at the JW Anderson studio.) “Jonathan has the discernment to know that [the drag performer] Divine, although queer and much more contemporary than, say, [the 18th-century English painter Thomas] Gainsborough, is also, in their way, a masterpiece,” says Bond. “Knowing what’s extraordinary in many contexts — he’s really good at keying into that.” In his JW Anderson designs, some of which took inspiration from the early 20th-century Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin and William Gedney’s 1960s photographs of American teenagers, Anderson, who doesn’t sketch, laid the groundwork for what would become his pastiche approach. Even now, he says that the part of the process he loves most is “trying to get this weird thing — a color or a painting — out of my brain.” Seldom do the clothes come from something as straightforward as “shearling” or “sci-fi,” says Bruno, who has a background in art criticism and literature. “It’s a little more psychological than that.”"},{type:"text",value:"Not coincidentally, Anderson’s closest friends and collaborators — among them Bruno, Guadagnino and the rapper and fashion designer ASAP Rocky, who shares, he says, an “innate search for the peculiar” — are magpies and polymaths with strong but ever-changing visual identities. “He’s the right kind of crazy,” says Rocky, who created a JW Anderson capsule collection in 2016. “Anytime I’m hitting a brick wall, my guy is always like, ‘Maybe you should do this, maybe you should do that.’ And if he needs some advice, like, ‘Maybe you should think twice about inviting these corny-ass celebs to your next show,’ I’m there to voice that, too.” Bruno observes, “Jonathan trusts people, but only if he thinks they excel at what they’re doing.” As a leader, Anderson believes in “turning up the temperature just enough without breaking people,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to get people to go down your vision hole, and you’ve got to hold their hand to make sure they don’t waver.”"},{type:"text",value:"Things were much simpler all those years ago, when Anderson and Bruno would sit on the floor of Anderson’s London studio late at night, constructing what Bruno refers to as “ghosts of garments” with as many swatches of fabric as they could afford. Anderson was an early practitioner of genderless dressing — he has separate men’s and women’s lines, but the sense has always been that anyone should wear whatever they like — although that, too, was partly a practical decision. “We were just sharing the same patterns because he couldn’t afford to have the atelier make two,” says Webster. “His enthusiasm was so contagious and so naïve that you could only say yes to him,” Bruno says. “There was that kind of youthful hope that you have when you don’t know too much about life.” A decade into his time at Loewe, Anderson has learned some difficult lessons. “Nothing will ever be good enough,” he says, sounding just like an uncompromising artist. “It’s quite lonely working two jobs in two different countries every week for 10 years.” Still, the idea of giving up fashion seems just as impossible. It’s been the vehicle for all his creative explorations and collaborations. The product might be clothes; the point, though, is craft."},{type:"text",value:"“FEEL IT, IT’S so hard,” says Josh O’Connor. In a suite at the Carlyle hotel on New York’s Upper East Side on the eve of the Met Gala this past May, the 34-year-old British actor is gesturing toward his custom Loewe white vest, which is covered with thousands of tiny caviar beads. But the 10 or so other people in the room, including Anderson, are distracted by his pants. Someone reports that Harry Lambert, O’Connor’s stylist, thinks his boots, which are also intricately beaded, with a floral motif, are too big, causing the pants to buckle at the ankles."},{type:"text",value:"Lambert’s assistant enters the room holding a pair of plain black boots. “Is she \u003Cem>kidding\u003C/em>?” says Anderson — flowers must remain on the footwear somehow to adhere to the gala’s theme — redirecting his attention to O’Connor, who looks down at his legs with an exaggerated display of shame. “Let’s add more satin,” says a member of Anderson’s team, instructing another to widen the pant legs. But it’s Sunday night, they’re told; all the fabric stores are closed. “Then cut the top of the boot,” says Anderson with a measured impatience. “Well, no,” the employee says. It would create too big of a mess. “But we could try buttons?”"},{type:"text",value:"Except for the faint sound of a Dolly Parton song playing in the background, the room goes silent. It’s almost like watching the final set of a tennis match; neither opponent is prepared to yield. After what feels like forever, Anderson is the first to relent. “Buttons on the back,” he says with a shrug. “But make sure they’re not too round.” In the end, they agree to tighten the top of the boot with a string. Having averted a crisis, the crew starts packing up. It’s time for dinner and then a meeting with Lee, who will be wearing what Anderson describes as a “new type of structure” at tomorrow’s event — a white Loewe gown with floral appliqués and a neckline that extends upward and outward like an aerodynamic shield."},{type:"text",value:"Anderson’s phone buzzes: His mother has been reminding him to send her some pictures from the party. The following week, he’ll be needed back in Paris to award the winner of the 2024 Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. Then he’ll unveil his latest collaboration with the running brand On and, shortly after that, he’ll present his new men’s wear collections for JW Anderson and Loewe. (The latter, titled A Radical Act of Restraint, is partly inspired by the work of Hujar and Thek.) In the coming months, he’ll release new Loewe campaigns starring Craig and Starkey — an unofficial kickoff to the “Queer” press tour, which could be even bigger than that for “Challengers.” As he goes through his schedule, a look of foreboding washes across his face. “You’re trying to be the son and the brother and the boyfriend, and you want to be a nice person,” says Anderson, who’s been doing breathing exercises when he gets stressed out. Then a big, boyish smile spreads across his face. “I’ve never had so much fun in my life.”"},{type:"text",value:{value:"Model: Achol Ayor at Women Management. Hair by Gary Gill at Streeters.
