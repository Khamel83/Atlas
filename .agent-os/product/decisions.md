## 2025-08-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Atlas will be positioned as a sophisticated local-first content ingestion and cognitive amplification platform targeting knowledge workers, researchers, and individuals seeking to amplify their cognitive abilities through automated content processing and intelligent insights.

### Context

The knowledge management landscape is dominated by cloud-based solutions that compromise data privacy and often fail to provide meaningful cognitive amplification. Users face information overload, fragmented knowledge sources, and poor recall systems that limit their ability to derive actionable insights from consumed content.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Cloud-Based SaaS Solution**
   - Pros: Easier deployment, automatic updates, cross-device sync
   - Cons: Data privacy concerns, subscription costs, vendor lock-in, limited customization

2. **Simple Local Note-Taking Tool**
   - Pros: Privacy, simplicity, low resource requirements
   - Cons: No AI amplification, manual processing, limited intelligence features

3. **Enterprise Knowledge Management**
   - Pros: Advanced features, team collaboration, enterprise support
   - Cons: High complexity, expensive, not focused on cognitive amplification

### Rationale

The local-first approach ensures complete data sovereignty while providing sophisticated AI-powered cognitive amplification. The multi-modal content processing capabilities address the fragmentation problem, while the five cognitive modules (ProactiveSurfacer, TemporalEngine, QuestionEngine, RecallEngine, PatternDetector) transform passive consumption into active intelligence generation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete data privacy and user control
- No subscription costs or vendor dependencies
- Sophisticated cognitive amplification capabilities
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Self-hosted deployment flexibility

**Negative:**
- Higher technical complexity for users
- Local resource requirements for AI processing
- Single-user focus limits collaboration features
- Manual deployment and maintenance responsibility

## 2025-08-02: Technology Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Atlas will use Python/FastAPI as the core framework with local-first architecture, targeting Raspberry Pi for primary deployment and Mac Mini M4 for intensive processing tasks.

### Context

Need for a robust, self-hosted solution that can handle diverse content types while maintaining complete data sovereignty and providing sophisticated AI processing capabilities.

### Rationale

- **Python/FastAPI**: Proven performance for API development with modern async capabilities
- **Local-First**: Complete data control and privacy compliance
- **Raspberry Pi Deployment**: Cost-effective, energy-efficient self-hosting
- **OpenRouter LLM Access**: Flexible, cost-effective AI model access
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Robust database abstraction for complex data relationships

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete data sovereignty and privacy
- Cost-effective deployment and operation
- Flexible AI model selection and pricing
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

**Negative:**
- Local resource constraints for processing
- Manual deployment and maintenance overhead
- Single-point-of-failure without cloud backup
