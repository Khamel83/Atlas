# Atlas Project Roadmap

## Current State (as of last analysis)

- The project was abandoned at some point, and the exact progress is unclear.
- Documentation might be outdated, with the most recent files being the most accurate.
- The codebase appears feature-rich but requires significant infrastructure work (testing, configuration, deployment).

## Immediate Priorities (Infrastructure Focus)

1.  **Systematic Review**: Conduct a programmatic and systematic review of the current codebase to accurately assess its status and identify completed features versus work in progress.
2.  **Infrastructure Completion**: Prioritize and complete the necessary infrastructure work, estimated to be 2-3 weeks of effort. This includes:
    -   Setting up robust testing frameworks.
    -   Streamlining configuration management.
    -   Establishing reliable deployment procedures (especially for Raspberry Pi).

## Future Features (Conceptual - to be refined)

Once the infrastructure is stable, the focus will shift to:

-   **Enhanced Data Acquisition**: Further improving the process of acquiring personal data in a usable format.
-   **Advanced Modeling**: Developing capabilities for personal data modeling and intelligence extraction.
-   **Cognitive Amplification**: Expanding on the unique cognitive amplification features of the platform.

## Long-Term Vision

-   Continue building out the platform to collect and process ALL of the user's personal world data.
-   Enable sophisticated personal intelligence and insights from the accumulated data.
-   Maintain an open-source, self-hosted, and non-commercial philosophy.
